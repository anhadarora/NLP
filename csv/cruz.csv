"Election 2016: Large Turnout but Deep Fissures for Voters --- In GOP, conservatives coalesce around Cruz; generational split is seen for Democrats",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761638090?accountid=12768,"A surge of evangelical Christians, along with support from the Republican Party's most conservative voters, combined to give Sen. Ted Cruz his victory in Iowa's GOP caucuses.
Democrats were locked in a close contest, with Sen. Bernie Sanders drawing overwhelming support from ""very liberal"" and younger voters, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton winning large margins among older and less-liberal voters.
Mr. Cruz built his campaign on opposition to abortion, gay marriage and compromise by Republican leaders in Congress. That message produced a distinct uptick in evangelicals and other social conservatives attending Monday's caucuses.
Evangelical Christians accounted for 64% of GOP caucusgoers, up from 57% in the 2012 caucuses, according to surveys conducted as Republicans entered meeting sites across the state. Mr. Cruz won a third of them, beating his top rivals, fellow Sen. Marco Rubio and businessman Donald Trump.
Mr. Cruz won an even larger share who said they wanted a nominee who ""shares my values."" Some 40% of GOP caucus-goers said that was the most important quality in a nominee, and Mr. Cruz carried 37% of them, entrance polls showed.
And Mr. Cruz won a substantial share of the party's most conservative voters, carrying 43% of them. Mr. Trump, his next-closest rival, took only 21%.
Entrance polls suggested that Mr. Trump made a significant mistake last week by skipping a televised Republican debate days before the caucuses, saying he was being treated unfairly by debate sponsor Fox News. Mr. Trump won just 14% support among caucusgoers who chose their candidate in the past week, a signal that Mr. Trump's shine in the state had likely faded in recent days.
Polling in New Hampshire and other states soon to hold nominating contests will be closely watched for similar signs of slumping support for Mr. Trump.
By contrast, Mr. Rubio propelled himself into the top ranks of the GOP contest in part by winning Republicans who decided which candidate to back in the past few days.
Mr. Rubio, who has tried to maintain broad appeal among the GOP's various voting blocs, drew a large share of Republicans whose top priority was a nominee who could win the general election. He carried more than 40% of that group, while Messrs. Cruz and Trump won one-quarter or less.
In a very crowded Republican field, the contingent of big-name establishment candidates -- former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- drew minuscule support.
Mr. Trump's was strongest among non-evangelicals and people who lack college degrees, reflecting a campaign built largely on speaking to the economic anxiety of middle- and lower-income Republicans.
Republicans attending their first caucuses played a big role in the results, accounting for 46% of caucusgoers, a larger share than the 38% in 2012. But the uptick in newcomers did not lead to the clear win for Mr. Trump that many had predicted.
Total GOP turnout topped 184,000 voters, shattering the previous record of roughly 121,000 caucusgoers.
While Mr. Trump won the largest share of first-time attendees, surveys showed that 61% of the newcomers were evangelical Christians, suggesting that Mr. Cruz had also driven new voters to the caucuses.
While Mr. Cruz posted outsize support among voters who said they wanted a candidate who shared their values, the largest chunk of the electorate, Mr. Trump won an overwhelming 67% of the much smaller group that wanted a candidate who ""tells it like it is.""
Democrats who attended their party's caucuses broke sharply along divisions of age, ideology and marital status, with Mr. Sanders garnering overwhelming margins among young voters and those who describe themselves as ""very liberal.""
Mr. Sanders's pull among younger Democrats was substantial, the entrance surveys showed. He drew 84% of voters under age 30, and he won nearly 60% of those age 30 to 44.
Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, won nearly 70% of seniors, as well as a majority of the next-oldest age group, voters age 50-64.
Nearly six in 10 voters who called themselves ""very liberal"" backed Mr. Sanders, while nearly six in 10 self-described ""moderate"" voters backed Mrs. Clinton. By a narrower margin, Mrs. Clinton also carried ""somewhat liberal"" voters, who make up the party's largest ideological group.
Supporters of Mrs. Clinton were drawn to her experience and the belief that she could beat Republicans in November. She garnered three-quarters or more support among Democrats who said those were the top attributes they sought in a nominee.

Cruz Vaults Past Trump in Iowa --- Rubio surges to close third as GOP voters turn out in record numbers for first 2016 contest,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761637520?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz outmuscled Donald Trump to win the Iowa caucuses on Monday, delivering a stinging rebuke to the celebrity businessman and establishing himself as a leading contender for the nomination.
The results Monday set the stage for a series of high-stakes showdowns in the weeks ahead between the top two finishers and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose appeal as a general-election candidate was good enough for a late surge that nearly overtook Mr. Trump.
""Tonight is a victory for the grass roots,"" said Mr. Cruz to a raucous victory party in Des Moines. ""Tonight is a victory for millions of Americans who have shouldered the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok.""
Mr. Trump kept his post-caucus remarks brief, thanking his family and the state of Iowa before turning his attention to contests that follow. ""We love New Hampshire, we love South Carolina,"" he said.
The race in Iowa exposed cracks in Mr. Trump's front-runner status. After a six-month ride atop the polls, his stardom wasn't enough to overcome Mr. Cruz's superior turnout machine and the Texan's appeal with the party's most conservative voters.
With 99% of the precincts reporting, Mr. Cruz led the GOP field as the top pick of 27.7% of Republican caucusgoers, followed by Mr. Trump at 24.3% and Mr. Rubio at 23.1%.
Mr. Cruz's victory was a remarkable turnaround for a candidate who entered the race as a little-known long shot, his rise a reflection of how much the GOP is now moved by the tea party and evangelical voters who have flocked to him.
The Texan generated his highest levels of support in Iowa from the most conservative caucusgoers, according to an entrance poll conducted for news organizations. He also performed well among evangelicals and Republicans who said he shared their values.
Mr. Rubio's late surge will increase interest in his candidacy and ratchet up the pressure on less-viable Republicans to drop out of the race to give more centrist, business-friendly voters a clearer alternative to Messrs. Cruz and Trump.
""For months, they told us we had no chance,"" Mr. Rubio told hundreds of cheering supporters Monday night. ""Tonight, here in Iowa, the people of this great state sent a very clear message.""
Mr. Rubio outpaced his rivals by big margins on the question of which candidate Republicans think can win in November, the entrance poll showed. He also built a big edge among caucusgoers who want the next president to be experienced. Those will be strong selling points in states where the electorate is less conservative than Iowa.
Messrs. Cruz and Trump had traded increasingly nasty barbs in the run-up to Iowa, setting up for a more bitter battle to follow. Mr. Trump has picked fights with rivals, major media organizations and party leaders in Washington, frequent skirmishes that have allowed him to dominate news coverage and drown out other Republicans with more typical resumes.
The Iowa results cement the top tier of the Republican field, and most of the contenders are expected to continue on to New Hampshire. But former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was a casualty of the Iowa caucuses, announcing on Twitter that he was withdrawing from the race.
Mr. Trump will get a chance to re-establish himself in states where polls show him up by as much as 20 percentage points -- although he had led in most Iowa polls before the caucuses began.
In addition, many back-of-the-pack contenders ended 2015 with enough money to finance bare-bones campaigns through the first four nominating states in February, new campaign-finance reports suggest.
""These first four races are going to set the playoffs,"" said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid. ""To advance, you need to do well in these first four.""
Republicans may have to wait until the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20 or possibly Super Tuesday on March 1 to get a clearer sense of which of the candidates have the strongest claim on the nomination.
Anger and frustration were defining features of the GOP electorate. Half described themselves as ""dissatisfied, but not angry"" about the way the federal government is working.
A somewhat smaller share said they were outright angry. And half of those Republicans who participated said they wanted the next president to be from outside the political establishment.
Big crowds flocked to caucus sites around the state, and early surveys suggested the share of first-time caucusgoers had ticked up from 2012.
Total GOP turnout topped 184,000 voters, shattering the previous record of roughly 121,000 caucusgoers. A GOP precinct in Van Meter ran out of ballots and forms to register new voters. ""We're way past capacity,"" said Bev McLinden, a local GOP official.
There were pockets of the state where Mr. Trump didn't register any support. At a caucus meeting in Pleasant Hill, none of the hundreds of Republicans in attendance rose to speak on his behalf. ""They said he had no ground game,"" said Mary Dorin, a Cruz supporter.
At a caucus in Cedar Rapids, Mr. Cruz made his own case to the assembled voters, telling them he has the money to compete late into the nominating calendar by citing his conservatism and his ability to win a general election.
Mr. Trump's improbable rise already has turned the race on its ear. The billionaire barely registered in public-opinion surveys last spring when he started making noise about a possible presidential bid, trailing by wide margins both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race in September.
Mr. Trump drew his highest levels of support from caucusgoers who didn't attend college, were more moderate and, first and foremost, listed immigration as their top issue, the entrance poll showed. He also drew higher support from caucusgoers eager for an outsider.
First-time caucusgoer Rachael Schwartz, 28, the mother of an 18-month-old daughter, said she likes Mr. Trump because he is outspoken and would let people make more decisions about their lives, such as whether to vaccinate their children. ""I never paid attention to the future, and now it's important to me,"" she said. ""I believe he's for the people, and we will truly have a voice.""
Mr. Trump's often-incendiary campaign rhetoric has turned off some would-be supporters who otherwise appreciate his brash style.
Valerie Martin, 36, a nurse midwife who attended the Cruz event in Jefferson, was leaning toward Mr. Trump before settling on his main rival. ""I don't know how he will be taken by other countries,"" she said.
Viability was a big lure on Monday as Republicans who planned to back other candidates decided to support one of the top-three.
Landon Myer, a quarry worker from Claire, Iowa was leaning toward Mr. Cruz, after considering Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. ""Cruz is the only one that's going to stop Trump,"" said Mr. Myer. ""I feel a vote for Rand Paul is a wasted vote.""

Election 2016: Cruz Win Chips Away at Ethanol's Clout,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761971620?accountid=12768,"Sen. Ted Cruz's Monday victory in the Iowa caucuses struck a blow against a seemingly unshakable rule of presidential politics: A candidate can't win Iowa without enthusiastically supporting the federal ethanol mandate.
A desire to court Iowa's influential corn growers has traditionally prompted candidates of all stripes, whatever their usual views of government, to embrace ethanol. Mr. Cruz gambled, successfully, that questioning the mandate would cement his position as a small-government purist and win the loyalty of the state's conservatives.
The Texas senator traveled the state, and the country, calling for phasing out the mandate, which calls for blending ethanol into gasoline, and eliminating it altogether by 2022. He became the first candidate to win the caucuses without supporting the mandate since Congress first created it in 2005, weathering a rare rebuke from Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad.
Mr. Cruz's win raises the question of whether the turbulent conservatism roiling the GOP electorate means that unconditionally embracing ethanol is no longer a requirement in the Iowa caucuses.
""The GOP nationally and in Iowa has become more conservative, and part of the new conservatism is a dislike of government subsidies -- letting Congress pick winners and losers,"" said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
The outcome chips away at the political clout of Iowa's corn-ethanol industry, traditionally considered a powerful force in one of the country's most important presidential battlegrounds.
Opponents of the mandate are likely to cite Monday's result as evidence Congress can muster the political will to repeal it. Republican leaders have so far resisted calls by oil companies and others to eliminate the rule, largely because their own party is divided.
Mr. Cruz garnered 27.7% of GOP caucusgoers, compared with 24.3% for second-place finisher businessman Donald Trump, who endorsed the mandate.
Corn has long been king in Iowa, the nation's top corn-producing state. Iowa's prized position as the first nominating state has made it hard for politicians to question the mandate.
Since 2011, though, that universal backing has been eroding. That year, Congress decided not to renew a tax credit that companies received to blend biofuels, which cost the government $6 billion a year. Critics of the government's ethanol policy then set their targets on the ethanol mandate, which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into the U.S. gasoline supply each year.
The presidential Republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, opposed the mandate and subsidies and opted not to campaign much in Iowa largely for that reason. He came in fourth in the GOP caucuses. The GOP nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, supported the mandate and came in second to Rick Santorum, who also backed the policy.
Whether Mr. Cruz's opposition to the mandate proves a bellwether of a larger political or policy shift remains to be seen. While Mr. Cruz garnered a plurality of caucusgoers, almost three-quarters supported other GOP candidates, most of whom backed the mandate.
Ethanol isn't an issue in most other states with key primary roles, including New Hampshire, which holds its vote next week.
Timothy Cheung, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners who tracks ethanol policy, warned against reading too much into Mr. Cruz's victory.
Noting that ""72.3% of Iowa opposed Ted Cruz and his ideas and 98% of the states hold their primaries after the Iowa Caucus,"" Mr. Cheung added, ""Good luck to the presidential candidate who ignores the political math.""
In the past couple of weeks before the caucuses, Mr. Cruz faced mounting criticism for his opposition to the policy from his biggest rival, Mr. Trump, and from Mr. Branstad, who took the rare step of urging Iowa Republicans not to vote for Mr. Cruz because of his lack of support for the ethanol mandate.
In a statement Tuesday, a spokesman for Mr. Branstad congratulated Mr. Cruz without mentioning ethanol. ""Sen. Cruz proved last night that going to all 99 counties and focusing on retail politics is the recipe for success,"" said Ben Hammes, Mr. Branstad's communications director.
A request for comment to Mr. Cruz's campaign wasn't immediately returned.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), who came in third in Iowa, joined Mr. Cruz in supporting an end to the mandate in 2022. But Mr. Rubio didn't favor phasing it out in the preceding years.

"As Cruz Stumbles, Rubio Is On Move",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767266325?accountid=12768,"ELKO, Nev. -- The battle between Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz intensified Monday as Mr. Rubio tried to cement himself as the clear establishment candidate for the Republican presidential nomination and Mr. Cruz ousted a top spokesman amid allegations of dirty tricks.
Mr. Rubio racked up endorsements from Republican elected officials, taking advantage of Jeb Bush's departure from the race after a poor showing in Saturday's South Carolina primary, upping pressure on Mr. Cruz as they both try to tarnish the luster of front-runner Donald Trump.
With Mr. Trump poised to win his third state in a row here in Nevada Tuesday night, and a looming calendar of states where the billionaire businessman holds large polling advantages, the shifts in tone and targets are turning the GOP primary contest into a two-man race for second place.
The South Carolina primary results, in which Mr. Cruz placed third, appear to be putting more pressure on him than others still in the Republican field. The Palmetto State had long been seen as tailor-made for Mr. Cruz's Southern roots and pitch to evangelical Christian voters.
Accusations that Mr. Cruz's aides or allies have engaged in unfair campaign tactics have dogged his campaign since the night of the Iowa caucuses, when Cruz volunteers incorrectly announced that Ben Carson, a competitor for evangelical voters, was dropping out. Mr. Cruz said it was a mistake by his staff and apologized to Mr. Carson.
Then, some South Carolina Republicans receivedautomated phone calls from pro-Cruz groups that implied Mr. Trump is pro-gay rights, and that Mr. Rubio supports ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants.
""There's nothing dirty about it,"" said Rick Shaftan, the spokesman with the super PAC Courageous Conservatives, which paid for the robocalls. He said they were factual and have run as radio ads.
Mr. Rubio said they were ""deceitful,"" and Mr. Trump called them ""sleazy and dishonest."" The Cruz campaign said it didn't know anything about what the outside group was doing and didn't condone it.
The Cruz team also sent voters controversial mailers and website depictions -- one of Mr. Rubio's face morphing into President Barack Obama's, and another that showed a manipulated image of Mr. Rubio shaking hands with Mr. Obama. The Cruz campaign declined to comment on the allegation.
Now, here in Nevada, Mr. Cruz found himself on Monday forced to discuss the conduct of his communications director, Rick Tyler, who the day before had posted to social media a video that wrongly implied Mr. Rubio made a derisive comment about the Bible.
""I've spent this morning investigating what happened. And this morning, I asked for Rick Tyler's resignation. I have made clear in this campaign that we will conduct this campaign with the very highest standards of integrity,"" Mr. Cruz told reporters.
Mr. Tyler, a veteran of GOP presidential campaigns, had already apologized for the post, but that didn't save his job.
""I've deleted the post because I would not knowingly post a false story,"" Mr. Tyler wrote on Facebook. ""But the fact remains that I did post it when I should have checked its accuracy first.""
For the Rubio campaign, the episode served as another opportunity to paint Mr. Cruz and his aides as stretchers of the truth. ""It's every single day something comes out of the Cruz campaign that's deceptive and untrue. And in this case goes after my faith,"" Mr. Rubio told reporters.
Mr. Trump took great glee at the latest Cruz stumble. In a series of posts on Twitter, Mr. Trump said the campaign tactics are costing his opponent.
""Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!""
Before northern Nevada crowds in Elko, Reno and Minden, Mr. Rubio sought to elevate himself above the bickering. He told an Elko crowd of about 500 people that he wouldn't engage in attacks against Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump.
""The field is narrower now, but you still have names to pick from,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""Maybe you like a couple people in this race and you're trying to decide between us. So I'm not here to bad-mouth anybody else.""
Mr. Rubio's top surrogates sought to paint the Republican contest as a two-man race between the Florida senator and Mr. Trump, all but dismissing Mr. Cruz as a competitor.
His campaign spentMondayannouncing endorsements from such longtime party leaders as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and a slew of current and former members of Congress, including a collection of Cuban Republicans from Miami who previously backed Mr. Bush.
Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who moved to back the Rubio campaign on Sunday after supporting Mr. Bush, said the GOP contest is now down to just the Florida senator and the New York developer.
Mr. Cruz made the same case for himself. ""The only campaign who has beat Donald Trump and the only campaign that has a path to beating Donald Trump is our campaign,"" Mr. Cruz told reporters at a Monday morning stop at a Las Vegas YMCA.
For the senators, who finished within 1,091 votes of each other Saturday in South Carolina, a second-place finish in Nevada would represent a significant boost over each other heading into the 11 states that hold nominating contests March 1.

Politics & Ideas: Bad Math for Cruz and Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767518796?accountid=12768,"The two most important numbers to emerge from last Saturday's contests are 22 and 27.
The former is the percentage of the African-American vote Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received in losing Nevada's Democratic caucuses by six points to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. By contrast, according to the entrance polls, Mr. Sanders split the white vote with Mrs. Clinton.
This leaves Mr. Sanders with a large strategic challenge. While African-Americans made up only 13% of caucus-goers in Nevada, they are likely to form more than half of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina on Saturday.
Following a timely endorsement from South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in the House of Representatives, this crucial bloc of voters appears poised to deliver a solid majority to Mrs. Clinton. And African-Americans make up a substantial share of the Democratic base throughout the South, including 51% in Alabama and Georgia and 48% in Louisiana. Latinos make up about 30% of the Democratic primary vote in Texas and California. But in the other contests between now and mid-March, their share is certain to be much lower.
Surprisingly, Mr. Sanders was not able to garner strong majorities among groups where he was expected to do well. Despite his class-based program and strong ideological appeal, he could gain no better than an even split with Mrs. Clinton among caucus-goers without college degrees and with incomes under $50,000. Even among caucus-goers who regard themselves as ""very liberal,"" he won by a narrow margin of 52% to 47%, not nearly enough to counterbalance Mrs. Clinton's 22-point edge among self-styled moderates.
Voters who want policies more liberal than President Obama's went for Mr. Sanders by 77% to 21%, compared with the 75% to 22% edge Mrs. Clinton received from voters who want to continue on Mr. Obama's course. Unfortunately for Mr. Sanders, the ""let us continue"" faction of the party outnumbered its ""to the left, march"" counterpart by nine percentage points.
Unless these dynamics change dramatically in the next few days, the vote in South Carolina, where Mrs. Clinton currently enjoys a double-digit advantage, should restore her standing as the strong front-runner for her party's presidential nomination.
The second crucial number -- 27 -- is the percentage of the evangelical vote Texas Sen. Ted Cruz received in South Carolina. This result goes to the heart of Mr. Cruz's meticulously scripted strategy for winning his party's nomination by establishing a dominant position among evangelicals as well as committed conservatives.
Mr. Cruz did reasonably well among very conservative primary voters, receiving 35%, ahead of Donald Trump's 29% and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 19%. But among evangelical voters, Mr. Cruz lost to Mr. Trump by six points while gaining only a modest advantage over Mr. Rubio. He also lost evangelicals to Mr. Trump in New Hampshire.
If this pattern of weak evangelical support continues, it is hard to see Mr. Cruz's path to victory, because his sharply etched profile limits his appeal outside his base. In South Carolina, for example, only 17% of ""somewhat conservative"" voters and 7% of moderates supported him, and his showing among nonevangelical voters was a meager 13%.
And despite his outsider stance since arriving in Washington, he lost to Mr. Trump by a staggering 50 points, 63% to 13%, among the 48% of South Carolina Republicans who want a president from outside the establishment. Even if Mr. Cruz prevails in Texas on March 1, the rationale for his candidacy has been weakened, perhaps fatally.
Although Ohio Gov. John Kasich has run a strong, positive campaign, gaining many admirers along the way, he is almost certainly too moderate -- at least as conservatism has been redefined during the past two decades -- to gain a plurality of his party's base.
A Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday suggests that Mr. Kasich will be hard-pressed to prevail against Mr. Trump even in his home state of Ohio, where he was re-elected as governor with 64% of the vote in November 2014.
If lifelong Republicans are to block Mr. Trump's hostile takeover of their party, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's withdrawal from the race leaves them with only one realistic option: Marco Rubio. The question is whether they can coalesce around him in time to stop Mr. Trump, and whether they are willing to undertake the no-holds-barred effort needed to unmask him. We will soon learn if Republican leaders will mount a real fight or meekly surrender.
A surprising number of Republicans have told me privately, and some are now saying publicly, that they cannot support Mr. Trump as their party's nominee. Last week, William Kristol, the editor of the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, floated the possibility of backing an independent conservative candidacy. This would not be the strangest thing to happen in a very strange election year.

"Election 2016: GOP Candidates Make Their Final Appeals --- Trump, Cruz exchange barbs while Rubio says he will be a uniter as Iowa caucuses near",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761395409?accountid=12768,"CEDAR FALLS, Iowa -- The crowded Republican presidential race spilled into its final day here with the top-tier candidates making sharply different cases for why each should win the nation's first election contest.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, returning to a theme he used to launch his campaign, promised to expand the party's electorate. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz accused his rivals of being insufficiently conservative. And Donald Trump, the unimaginable GOP front-runner when the campaign began a year ago, promised rallies across the state to ""make America great again"" without offering many specifics.
The closing arguments reflected bets on who will decide Iowa's Monday night caucuses -- and what placing first, second or third would mean for each camp.
Mr. Rubio, in a town-hall style meeting Sunday afternoon at the University of Northern Iowa, argued he is best equipped to unite the GOP's disparate elements as the party has been split by the anti-establishment campaigns of Messrs. Cruz and Trump.
""No one running for president can bring the conservative movement and the Republican Party back together faster than I can,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""We won't just unite this party, we will grow it.""
Mr. Cruz closed his Iowa campaign yo-yoing between attacking his two top rivals and offering a strictly positive message about himself. In the campaign's final weeks, the first-term senator diverged from his once-disciplined commitment to avoid attacking other candidates, which endeared him to voters who see in him an alternative to politics as usual.
Saturday night in Sioux City, Mr. Cruz went after both of his rivals for their supposed conservative apostasies.
""A vote for Rubio is a vote for amnesty"" for illegal immigrants, Mr. Cruz said. ""A vote for Trump is a vote for Obamacare.""
Mr. Trump fired repeated barbs at Mr. Cruz while essentially ignoring Mr. Rubio. He campaigned alongside Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., who vouched for the New Yorker's appeal for evangelical voters. In a Sunday TV interview on Fox, Mr. Trump said he would ""strongly consider"" appointing Supreme Court justices who would seek to overturn last year's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.
To his crowds, Mr. Trump crowed over the latest polling numbers. In Council Bluffs, he reminded Iowa voters that Monday is their opportunity to ""pick a winner"" -- in a state that hasn't picked the GOP nominee since George W. Bush in 2000.
""You have a lousy record, you've gone 16 years without picking a winner,"" Mr. Trump said to a laughing crowd. ""Please, pick a winner,"" he added, pointing to himself.
Messrs. Cruz and Trump are each heavily invested in winning Iowa. Mr. Cruz declared himself the front-runner here in January, before Mr. Trump launched attacks on his Canadian birth and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, the state's most popular Republican, said Iowans shouldn't vote for Mr. Cruz because of his opposition to federal ethanol mandates.
If Mr. Rubio finishes in second place ahead of either rival, it would be a damaging blow to the candidate coming in third. Rubio aides have publicly played down their own expectations, providing an opening for a surprise finish.
One Rubio target, Mike Hammer of Clive, said at Mr. Rubio's Saturday night rally in Urbandale that he remains torn between the Florida senator and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, after previously flirting with Govs. John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin; Mr. Walker ended his campaign in September.
""Early on I liked governors,"" said Mr. Hammer, a 56-year-old financial planner. ""Now . . . I want to get the guy who can beat Trump.""
Mr. Cruz's success in Iowa will hinge on winning over voters like Scott Hardwick, a landscaper from North Liberty who had been turned from Mr. Trump by his attacks on Mr. Cruz. ""I wasn't anti-Trump until he came down like he did on Ted Cruz,"" said Mr. Hardwick. ""It caused me to eliminate any doubt about who Donald Trump was.""
Lower-polling candidates aimed to peel away support from the front-runners.
Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul are airing ads attacking Mr. Cruz. And Mr. Christie, with 3% support in the latest Des Moines Register poll, argued Messrs. Rubio and Cruz lack sufficient executive experience to be president and slammed Mr. Trump for being unserious.
And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who when the race began was considered a favorite because of his lineage and robust fundraising but is now polling at 2% support, found himself lamenting his inability to attract voters.

Election 2016: Cruz Fires Salvos at His Top Two Rivals,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762622659?accountid=12768,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz questioned on Thursday the behavior of one of his top Republican presidential rivals, moments before telling a crowd that voters aren't ""interested in insults and attacks.""
""Donald Trump is very rattled right now,"" Mr. Cruz told the crowd at a Toyota dealership. ""He told the entire world he was going to win Iowa, and he didn't. And his reaction is he got very angry.""
Mr. Cruz predicted a repeat performance following next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. ""I assumed the next question he's going to ask is 'How stupid can the people of New Hampshire be?' "" Mr. Cruz said, in an out-of-context reference to comments Mr. Trump made earlier in the campaign about Iowa voters.
Since finishing second in Iowa, Mr. Trump has accused the Texas senator of ""stealing"" the caucuses because his supporters suggested Ben Carson was dropping out of the race. On Thursday, Mr. Trump sought to move away from the sharp exchanges with Mr. Cruz and focus on other issues.
Candidates regularly portray themselves as above the fray while strafing rivals with none-too-subtle digs. ""This is a job interview,"" Mr. Cruz told the crowd, in response to a sympathetic question from the audience. ""I don't think people are interested in temper tantrums.""
Mr. Cruz also criticized Sen. Marco Rubio, calling him a ""very talented guy"" who ""has already demonstrated that he is willing to break his word with the voters and make deals with Democrats and try to force through amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally.""

Ted Cruz's post-Iowa victory lap has been clouded by a dispute with Ben Carson and Donald Trump over allegations that the Texas senator's supporters had spread false rumors on the night of the Iowa caucuses that Mr. Carson would be dropping out of the race.
The feud escalated Wednesday when Mr. Carson said that the misinformation had affected the outcome of the contest and Mr. Trump, who came in second place behind Mr. Cruz in Iowa, said the Iowa results should be overturned.
""Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified,"" Mr. Trump said on Twitter. ""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it.""
Mr. Cruz said he hadn't been aware his campaign was spreading false information about Mr. Carson and called him to apologize on Tuesday. But he was less polite in his response to Mr. Trump's remarks on the matter.
""My girls are 5 and 7,"" the Texas senator said. ""And I've got to tell you, Caroline and Catherine are better behaved than a presidential candidate who responds by insulting everyone every day.""
The dispute carries some risk for Mr. Cruz because he has been counting on using his Iowa momentum to build support among evangelicals, many of whom have been backing Mr. Carson.
""Ben Carson is not someone I would want to be mad at me if I wanted to expand my evangelical support,"" said Newt Gingrich, former House speaker and a 2012 presidential candidate.
The feud between Messrs. Carson and Cruz started on Monday evening after CNN reported that the retired neurosurgeon planned to take a break from the campaign trail rather than fly directly to New Hampshire or South Carolina, where the next primaries would be held.
Users of a Ted Cruz campaign app received messages from the campaign as they were preparing to participate in the caucuses, according to images shared on social media.
The message read, ""CNN is reporting that Ben Carson will stop campaigning after Iowa. Make sure to tell all of your peers at the caucus supporting Carson that they should coalesce around the true conservative who will be in the race for the long haul: TED CRUZ!""
And Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a co-chairman of the Cruz campaign, tweeted, ""Carson looks like he is out. Iowans need to know before they vote.""
On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz said the campaign had merely disseminated the CNN report to his supporters because it was relevant, but said the campaign never said Mr. Carson was dropping out.
At a Wednesday news conference, Mr. Carson said he thought the misinformation had hurt his showing in the Iowa caucuses. He came in fourth place with 9.3% of the vote, behind Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio.

"Rubio Challenges Trump, Cruz in Poll",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762768271?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The Republican presidential race in the Granite State increasingly looks like a referendum on Sen. Marco Rubio as much as on the current front-runner, Donald Trump.
While the celebrity businessman still holds a double-digit lead ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Mr. Rubio ranked second in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters, released on Friday. It caps a week of the Florida senator rising in the polls following a surprisingly strong third-place finish in Monday's Iowa caucuses.
Well-heeled donors in New York and other wealthy enclaves are showing renewed interest in Mr. Rubio. Other Republicans are rallying around him, including former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, his onetime rival who endorsed Mr. Rubio late Friday.
Mr. Rubio has emerged as a clear alternative to Mr. Trump and the Iowa winner, Sen. Ted Cruz, for Republicans looking to back someone else. He was the top pick of 17% in the Marist poll, jumping six percentage-points from a pre-Iowa survey. Mr. Cruz had 15% and Mr. Trump led with 30%.
Meanwhile, three current and former governors -- Jeb Bush of Florida, Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio -- are fighting to keep their bids alive, according to the new poll.
Mr. Rubio's crowds have swelled, and in a sign that he can go deeper into the primary season, the Las Vegas newspaper owned by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, chief executive of Las Vegas Sands Corp., on Friday endorsed Mr. Rubio, a potential boost ahead of the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 23.
""Even though he's scripted, he's solid on the issues,"" said James Betti, 58 years old, a physician from Rye, N.H., who attended a Trump event Thursday but is leaning toward supporting Mr. Rubio.
Other Republicans will get a chance to slow Mr. Rubio's rise Saturday night at the last candidates' debate, sponsored by ABC News and WMUR, the local affiliate. Mr. Christie's attacks have been particularly fierce, dubbing Mr. Rubio ""the boy in the bubble"" for his reluctance to stray from his stump speech and questioning his record of achievement in the Senate.
Joe McQuaid, publisher of the Union Leader, which has endorsed Mr. Christie, penned a stinging editorial that ran on the front page of Friday's paper criticizing Mr. Rubio. ""Young Rubio must think New Hampshire a bunch of rubes,"" he wrote. ""He hasn't spent much time here but is trying to sell himself with TV ads as someone who can go to Washington to clean up the Washington mess. Earth to Rubio: You are a U.S. senator. The Senate meets in Washington. You are hardly an outsider.""
Mr. Cruz also enjoyed a post-Iowa bump in the poll following his win over Mr. Trump. He laughed off the increased attention on Mr. Rubio. ""If momentum was measured by the media, Marco Rubio would already be the Republican nominee,"" Mr. Cruz told reporters after a campaign stop in Weare, N.H. ""In the media's telling, bronze is the new gold. And Iowa demonstrated the media doesn't get to the pick the Republican nominee.""
Some of the attacks -- that Mr. Rubio is too young, that he supported a pathway to citizenship for people in the country illegally, and that he has skipped too many Senate votes -- have sunk in with some voters here.
""The thing that concerns me is him not being at the votes,"" said Charlie List, 58, of Derry, N.H., who attended a Rubio event Friday night but is still on the fence. ""Most people, if you don't show up for work, you don't get paid.""
People fundraising for Mr. Rubio's team said fence-sitting Wall Street donors are finally warming to him. Bankers, hedge-fund managers, private-equity executives and other financial-industry professionals are promising to open their wallets, according to interviews with existing donors and some others who are planning to contribute.
Investors would like to see Mr. Rubio prevail because he is a ""very business-friendly but competent, likeable candidate,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at HighTower Advisors.
Mr. Rubio, 44, has already attracted some younger Wall Street donors who have not previously been all that politically active, including: Thomas Farley, president of NYSE Group; hedge-fund manager Eric Mandelblatt of Soroban Capital Partners LP; Brian Levine, a managing director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.; and Sean Klimczak, a senior managing director at Blackstone Group LP, say people familiar with the matter.
In his closing argument to Iowa Republicans, Mr. Rubio talked up his conservatism, religious faith and ability to unite disparate wings of the GOP. In New Hampshire, he has spoken of uniting the entire country, an appeal that could resonate more in a state where independents accounted for nearly half of the GOP primary electorate in 2012.
""We need to stop pitting Americans against each other,"" Mr. Rubio told hundreds of people packed into a second-floor bar in Dover, N.H., citing his work across the aisle in the Florida Legislature.
Some undecided GOP primary voters here said Mr. Rubio's performance in Iowa, coupled with a perception that he would perform well against a Democrat in the general election, are the biggest factors working in his favor. In addition, they note that he seems more viable than other Republicans seeking the support of the party's less-conservative voters.
But Mr. Rubio hasn't sealed the deal with them yet. Mark Swartz, 55, an undecided primary voter from Rye, said he is torn between Messrs. Kasich, Rubio and Trump. ""I'm not sure Kasich has the legs to make it to November,"" Mr. Swartz said. ""That's why I'm leaning toward Rubio.""

New Hampshire: Where Candidates Get Their Party On --- Cruz promises pig roasts; Kasich struggles with guest list,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763313023?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Ted Cruz has talked about a lot of things he would like to do if elected president, but one plan has flown more under the radar. ""We're going to have a pig roast on the south lawn of the White House,"" he said on a recent day, campaigning here. ""We're going to dig a pit and we're going to roast up a pig.""
The hosts chuckled at Mr. Cruz's idea. ""Very nice,"" one said. Later, an audience member gave Mr. Cruz a lightsaber.
The Republican Texas senator was at Saint Anselm College for the ""Life of the Party"" candidate forum, a new series of pre-primary events that seek to elicit ""genuine conversation"" from presidential hopefuls rather than worn stump speeches. The idea, says Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, is to also show voters that many candidates are ""fun to be around.""
Co-hosted by ""Stay Work Play New Hampshire,"" a group for young professionals, the events touch on topics such as candidates' favorite books and ""Star Wars"" characters to what a White House party hosted by them would look like.
The ""Life of the Party"" is structured like a daytime talk show, with lively music. Candidates sit at a table on a riser with three chatty hosts, who lob questions at the guest as well as invite a few queries from the audience.
Most of the big-name Republican candidates attended a session, but both main Democrats couldn't fit it into their schedules before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
The inspiration came in part from ""Mitt,"" the 2014 documentary and behind-the-scenes look at the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Mr. Levesque said.
In one memorable part of that show, Mr. Romney, wearing a tuxedo and about to leave for an event, realizes a cuff on his shirt is wrinkled. He tries to quickly iron it while still wearing the shirt.
""Ouch,"" Mr. Romney says as he irons. ""Ouch. Ouch!""
""That's good enough, Mitt for goodness' sake,"" his wife tells him.
Many viewers ""had no idea that Mitt Romney was so personable,"" Mr. Levesque said.
For the politicians, there is a benefit to going off script. ""Candidates get bonus points for showing their personalities"" to voters, said Dante Scala, an associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.
Of course, off-the-cuff moments can also result in bloopers that become part of political lore. As a running mate for Democrat George McGovern's ill-fated 1972 presidential bid, Sargent Shriver, the founding director of the Peace Corps, made a gaffe that decades later was mentioned in his obituary: he called out ""make mine a Courvoisier!"" in a working-class bar.
And GOP presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani took some heat in 2007 when, after his beloved Yankees lost in the playoffs, he said he was rooting for the Boston Red Sox to win the World Series over the Colorado Rockies. He was panned as pandering to New Hampshire voters since no self-respecting Yankees fan would ever cheer on the Red Sox.
In the 2016 race, Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was accused of opportunism when she tweeted in support of the University of Iowa football team -- ahead of the Iowa caucuses -- over her alma mater, Stanford. She said the tweet was ""tongue-in-cheek.""
There have been only a few awkward moments at the ""Life of the Party"" events, which are videotaped. Asked to name a nonpolitician he would like to have a beer with as president, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio mentioned the teenage Nobel Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai on his list, prompting some jabs online that Mr. Rubio wanted to have a beer with an underage Muslim.
When Mr. Cruz was asked which three people -- living or dead -- he would like to invite to a party, with specific instructions not to include politicians, he named the three figures whose busts he has in his office, which include Ronald Reagan and Winston Churchill, both politicians, as well as activist Martin Luther King.
Still, he and other guests offered personal tidbits. Mr. Cruz said his habit of playing videogames, including Candy Crush and Plants vs. Zombies, on his smartphone, ""drives my wife crazy."" Mr. Rubio talked about listening to electronic dance music and being thrilled when his family got an encyclopedia collection.
Mike Skelton, the 33-year-old chief of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, helped moderate the events and said Republican candidate Jeb Bush was ""absolutely the biggest surprise"" because ""you got to see how engaging he was.""
Mr. Bush described himself as an ""introvert,"" and said that his theoretical party at the White House, for young professionals, would be a more serious affair in which he would try to learn from the group.
""So it would be more of a house coffee?"" he was asked.
""Well, I would give you snacks,"" Mr. Bush replied.
He also let on that, as he goes from one hotel to another while campaigning, he yearns for the mattress he splurged on back home.
""I bought a really cool bed,"" he said. ""I mean this is a bed that, it costs about like a Yugo or Hyundai. It's a pretty expensive bed. It's beautiful and I sleep well.""
Since the events draw 20- and 30-somethings, candidates also see a chance to reach young voters. In 2008, the last time New Hampshire had a competitive primary election for both parties, about 30% of voters on each side were under 40, according to exit polls.
Some candidates are momentarily puzzled by the unorthodox queries. ""So what's your question? Who would I invite?"" asked Ohio Gov. John Kasich, about the White House party question.
Later, Mr. Kasich couldn't resist going paternal. Asked what music he liked, he digressed into talking about a late rock star who had high-profile substance-abuse battles. He wanted to know who in the audience had seen drug use at parties.
""Anybody here?"" he asked. ""Nobody? You don't want to say yes, because the camera's on, OK?""
""Now, back to bands that I like,"" Mr. Kasich said, mentioning his love for Pink Floyd.
On style, Mr. Cruz said Republicans should lighten up. ""Would it kill Republicans to crack a joke? Have some fun.""
He then told a couple of his own jokes: ""Reaganomics: You start a business in your parents' garage. Obamanomics: You move into your parents' garage.""
It didn't bring the house down.

Election 2016: Cruz Tax Plan Would Trim Revenue,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765510087?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz's tax plan would cut projected federal revenue by about a fifth over the next decade, according to a new analysis -- a hit that would require sizable spending cuts to meet his goal of balancing the federal budget.
Mr. Cruz's plan would reduce federal tax collections by $8.6 trillion over 10 years, and that doesn't include additional interest on extra debt, according to the Tax Policy Center's analysis, released Tuesday.
High-income households would be the biggest beneficiaries of a plan that would lower tax rates and move dramatically toward a consumption tax. The top 1% would get a 26% boost in income in 2017, the analysis said.
The Texas senator is offering one of the most significant shifts in taxation among the field of Republican presidential candidates, and he is banking on Americans' frustration with the complexity and burden of today's system to overcome criticism from both Republicans and Democrats.
Mr. Cruz would repeal the corporate income tax, payroll taxes, taxes created as part of President Barack Obama's health-care law and the estate tax. In their place, he would impose a 16% ""business flat tax"" that would become the government's primary revenue source.
Under Mr. Cruz's plan, businesses would deduct payments to other businesses and capital expenses but not wages. His business flat tax is economically equivalent to the value-added taxes used in every other industrialized country, though unlike those, it wouldn't be imposed at the retail level.
Mr. Cruz would also lower individual income tax rates to 10% and exempt the first $36,000 of a four-person family's income.
""My tax plan -- typical family of four -- first $36,000 you earn, you pay nothing in taxes. No income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing,"" he said during Saturday's GOP debate in South Carolina. ""Everyone pays the same simple flat 10% income rate. It's flat and fair.""
That statement assumes individuals wouldn't pay his business tax, but the tax would in fact be embedded in their wages, as well as the prices of products and services they buy.
According to the center's analysis, under Mr. Cruz's plan, every income group would pay less in taxes in 2017 than they do now. The remaining tax burden would shift from high-income households to everyone else. The bottom 20% of households would pay an average federal tax rate of 3.8%, down from 4.1% under current law. By 2025, that bottom income group would lose some after-tax income because his business tax would have a ""depressing effect"" on wages.
By contrast, thanks to lower taxes on wages, capital gains, savings and business income, the top 0.1% would have a 15.2% average tax rate, down from 34.2%.
The Tax Policy Center is a nonpartisan project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution that used a bipartisan panel of reviewers. The center made some assumptions about Mr. Cruz's plan because his campaign didn't respond to their detailed questions.

"Election 2016: Straight Fight With Trump Eludes Cruz --- Senator solidifies position, but Kasich win deprives him of one-on-one contest",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382335?accountid=12768,"Tuesday's presidential primaries solidified Ted Cruz's position as the most formidable competitor to front-runner Donald Trump. But the results kept the Texas senator from his goal of winnowing the field to a two-man race between himself and the New York businessman.
With Ohio Gov. John Kasich winning the primary in his home state, he is sure to remain in the race for the foreseeable future. That deprives Mr. Cruz of the one-on-one contest with Mr. Trump that he believes would allow him to rally the anti-Trump vote that has been split in a multi-candidate field.
Still, with Sen. Marco Rubio vanquished in his home state of Florida and driven from the race, Mr. Cruz is strengthened and will emerge from the day's voting with more delegates than anyone but Mr. Trump. But his hopes increasingly will have to rest on blocking Mr. Trump from clinching the nomination, rather than on clinching it himself, and then battling at a contested party convention. Even as he steadily accumulates delegates, Mr. Cruz faces a rapidly narrowing path to secure the 1,237 delegates needed to win.
""It will be mathematically possible, but, to me, it would be highly improbable,"" said Steve Munisteri, the former GOP chairman in Texas and former adviser to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's presidential campaign. Mr. Munisteri estimated that, even with a good night on Tuesday, Mr. Cruz would have to win some 8 out of 10 delegates up for grabs in the remaining contests.
The next two states to vote, Arizona and Utah on March 22, will be crucial tests of Mr. Cruz's argument that anti-Trump voters will increasingly rally behind his candidacy. Those two states -- and the vast majority of other states still to vote -- give Mr. Cruz one advantage: They limit voting participation to registered Republicans. Mr. Trump so far has fared better in states that allow independents and Democrats to vote in GOP primaries.
But Arizona poses a stiff challenge for Mr. Cruz, because illegal immigration, Mr. Trump's signature issue, is a top concern there, and the businessman has won endorsements from the state's leading crusaders against illegal immigrants, former Gov. Jan Brewer and Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County.
Utah is more promising for Mr. Cruz, because Republicans, in lieu of primary elections, meet in caucuses. That is a more time-consuming nominating process that, in other states earlier this year, has rewarded Mr. Cruz's organizational prowess. What is more, Utah's GOP Sen. Mike Lee has endorsed Mr. Cruz, the first fellow senator to back him.
The political road beyond that is less friendly to Mr. Cruz's brand of evangelical conservatism than the Southern states that have dominated the calendar so far. The spring brings many primaries in Northeastern states that are in Mr. Trump's backyard, as a lifelong New Yorker, and more inclined to back less-conservative Republicans than Mr. Cruz.
Jeff Roe, the Cruz campaign manager, acknowledges there are tough fights ahead in such delegate-rich states as Wisconsin, New Jersey and New York. But he said the campaign's goal remains to clinch the nomination, not just prevent Mr. Trump from doing so.
""We believe we can still win in the battlefield, and that is what we intend to do,"" Mr. Roe said.
Still, the Cruz campaign is quietly arming for a contested convention in Cleveland if Mr. Trump fails to nail the nomination in advance. It is systematically trying to influence local GOP delegate selection processes to ensure as many Cruz supporters go to the convention as possible.
Even though most convention delegates are bound by their state's rules to vote for specific candidates on the first ballot, based on their primary results, the delegates are free to support others if no candidate at the convention secures a majority and a second ballot is taken.
Even before the March 1 primary in Texas, the Cruz campaign encouraged supporters to prepare to attend the precinct and county meetings that are the early stages of naming the state's convention delegates. That could amplify Cruz supporters' influence if the convention is embroiled in a multiballot fight. ""We have an entire operation focused on this,"" Mr. Roe said.

Election 2016: Cruz Plays Ground Game in Missouri,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773150299?accountid=12768,"HANNIBAL, Mo. -- As rival politicians poured their energy into bigger states like Ohio and Florida, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz was determined not to overlook Missouri, hoping to unlock the support of voters focused on gun rights and religion.
With Missouri's primary slated for Tuesday, Mr. Cruz deployed surrogates here tactically, sending his wife, Heidi, to speak at a Republican dinner outside of St. Louis on Saturday night and his father, Rafael Cruz, a preacher, to this city on Monday.
""The freedom to express your love for the Lord -- they want to squelch that,"" said Jan Kreider, 77 years old, explaining why she planned to vote for the Texas senator.
Polls in Missouri suggest that Republican front-runner Donald Trump may have an edge over Mr. Cruz. But unlike winner-take-all states like Ohio, Missouri will award delegates on a proportional basis, meaning the strategically oriented Mr. Cruz could have something to show for his efforts in the Show Me State.
The question is whether the combination of organization and messaging aimed at core supporters can overcome the broad appeal of Mr. Trump. ""He's probably not the type of conservative that I think that the people want, but he's saying the things that are going to make the changes that we want,"" said C.F. Barnes, a 74-year-old from Jefferson City, the state's capital, adding that Mr. Cruz is ""a little bit too much.""
On the Democratic side, polls gave Hillary Clinton an edge over rival Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator. But the Sanders campaign was working hard in Missouri. ""He's the first politician that I've ever been into,"" said Joel Williams, a public-health scientist who lives in Columbia.
But Mrs. Clinton has the support of the Kansas City Star, one of the state's biggest newspapers, as well as Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.
Mr. Trump held a rally in Kansas City on Saturday, while contenders John Kasich, the Ohio governor, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have less of a visible presence here, disappointing some Missouri Republicans who prefer the two men but fear that supporting either would waste a vote.
On Saturday, Mr. Cruz's campaign announced the support of more than 30 Missouri religious leaders.

Cruz on Ethics Defense,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766256740?accountid=12768,"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign on Thursday found itself in rough but increasingly familiar territory. It wasn't talking about policies or consistent conservatism. It was instead trying to explain why it had photoshopped a fake image of Marco Rubio shaking Barack Obama's hand.
It's a true saying in politics that if you are denying or explaining, you have a problem. By that standard, Ted Cruz may have a problem.
For months now, Mr. Cruz has run a focused and rigorous campaign. He marked out the voter groups he needed to win Iowa, and delivered targeted messages. He slipstreamed behind Donald Trump, siphoning off his voters. He's been militantly on message, with the argument that he's the only ""consistent"" conservative in the race.
All that discipline got pushed aside on Wednesday, when Mr. Cruz instead felt compelled to spend a long news conference defending against accusations of lies and dirty campaign tactics.
Most of the ensuing headlines were about Mr. Cruz's ""bring it on"" response to a threatened Donald Trump lawsuit. But this overlooks what he spent most of the event doing -- denying that his campaign had anything to do with fake Facebook pages or underhanded push polls.
This is a tough place to be three days out from a vital primary, and Donald Trump is surely grinning. Up or down in this race, Mr. Trump always has a megaphone, and for the past weeks he's used it almost exclusively to blast one message: Ted Cruz is unethical. It's a particularly rough charge because -- unlike disputes over policy or records -- accusations about character sometimes have a way of seeping into the voter conscience, and are harder to dispute. And they can snowball.
Mr. Cruz provided the opening for this with his campaign's decision on Iowa caucus night to suggest to voters that Ben Carson was suspending his campaign, and to urge them to vote for him instead. Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Cruz disqualified for ""fraud."" Dr. Carson accused him of ""deceit"" and ""lies"" and ""dirty tricks."" Mr. Cruz blamed it on a ""mix-up"" and apologized.
Yet before the dust had settled, reports came out of a Cruz campaign mailer sent to Iowa voters. The outside contained giant red letters reading ""VOTER VIOLATION"" and the words ""public record"" and ""further action needed."" Inside, the mailer warned recipients of ""low expected voter turnout"" in their area, claimed that their voting record might be publicized, and pushed them to caucus. The Iowa secretary of state, a Republican, blasted the Cruz campaign for misrepresenting his office and Iowa election law.
A new controversy has since sprouted in Ohio over another Cruz mailer. This envelope bears Mr. Cruz's name, as well as big black letters reading: ""Check Enclosed."" Inside there is a check, only it is made out to Mr. Cruz from the recipient -- along with an appeal to make a contribution. Ohio Republican Chairman Matt Borges complained that the letter -- with its suggestion of a government check -- was ""shady"" and went ""right up to the edge.""
Mr. Cruz's problem is that these shenanigans have laid the groundwork for his campaign to be accused of far worse deeds in South Carolina. Mr. Trump used the most recent Republican debate to charge the Cruz campaign with orchestrating push-poll calls that trashed the other candidates. Recipients reported that the calls came courtesy of Remington Research, an outfit started by Mr. Cruz's campaign manger.
The Rubio campaign meanwhile tagged the Cruz campaign with ginning up a fake Facebook page that falsely claimed popular South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy was switching his support from Mr. Rubio to Mr. Cruz.
These accusations were the subject of Mr. Cruz's news conference Wednesday, in which he vehemently insisted his campaign had nothing to do with the Facebook page or the push-poll calls. (Remington has also denied it did the calls.)
Yet the theme is pulsing, and it got more fuel Thursday when the Rubio-Obama photoshop story broke. Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler at first claimed the campaign would never use a photo that wasn't authentic. Then he reversed and claimed that the Rubio campaign was ""petulant"" and ""piddly"" to even care about a fake photo. Which inspired a Twitter frenzy of people posting their own photoshopped pictures of Mr. Cruz hugging Mr. Obama and various unsavory characters -- to make a point.
Mr. Gowdy, a former prosecutor who is very popular in the state, was so appalled that he cut a video. ""My fellow South Carolinians do not mind tough politics, but it has to be fair, it has to be accurate -- the truth matters."" He lambasted the photoshopping.
Mr. Cruz used his Thursday presser to score the other campaigns for leveling some of their accusations with ""no evidence,"" and suggested it was they who were playing out of bounds. In what's proving a low-tactic campaign year, he may have a point. His problem is that memes -- right or wrong -- have a way of attaching to, and then defining, campaigns. And right now, there is only one Republican defending against the ""dirty tricks"" line.

Election 2016: Cruz Super PACs Embrace Ground Game --- Wealthy donors are wary of TV ads after they often failed to win over voters in 2012,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766256709?accountid=12768,"REIDVILLE, S.C. -- On a cul-de-sac in this town midway between Greenville and Spartanburg, Tommy Dimsdale bounds up the steps of a ranch house to deliver his well-honed pitch on behalf of a Republican presidential candidate.
""Out here canvassing for Ted Cruz and just letting everyone know about his conservative Christian principles,"" explained Mr. Dimsdale, 24 years old, to the voter who answers the front door -- an appeal tailored for evangelical voters in the state.
Mr. Dimsdale isn't a volunteer for the Texas senator's campaign. Instead, he is a paid staffer for a super PAC boosting Mr. Cruz.
Building a voter-turnout operation is just one way super PACs and their deep-pocketed benefactors are trying out new roles after seeing millions spent on television ads that failed to win over voters in the last presidential election. This weekend's South Carolina primary will be a major test of whether they have made the right adjustments and can become the political powerhouses some once predicted.
That contrasts with four years ago, when the super PAC backing Republican Mitt Romney spent more than 90% of its money on advertising during the primaries and had no significant staff in the early voting states, according to a nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics analysis of financial disclosure reports.
Mr. Cruz's outside operation is notable for its discipline and complexity.The network of committees initially drew puzzlement as it sat on its cash through the fall, while Right to Rise, the pro-Bush group, spent more than $50 million mostly on television ads.
That strategic decision, though, left the pro-Cruz PACs with more than $30 million to spend just as the primary season began heating up. While Mr. Bush's ads failed to move him up in the polls, the pro-Cruz super PACs were credited with maximizing the turnout of evangelicals in Iowa and netting a surprise victory for Mr. Cruz over Donald Trump.
Kellyanne Conway, who runs one of the four super PACs backing Mr. Cruz, called the latest evolution of super PACs ""a direct byproduct of how betrayed and frustrated so many major donors felt after 2012.""
One set of those donors is the Texas-based Deason family, who back Mr. Cruz. The Deasons say they like to keep tight control over funds, having learned their lesson from 2012, when they felt super PACs' spending was ineffective.
""If they've got a bad idea, we're going to say no and not fund it,"" said Doug Deason, son of billionaire Darwin Deason.
The pro-Cruz operation is a network of four loosely affiliated groups that coordinate with each other on strategy and message but are each funded by different donors.
The four PACs share similar names: Keep the Promise I, Keep the Promise II, Keep the Promise III and Keep the Promise PAC. Hedge-fund millionaire Robert Mercer is funding Keep the Promise I, while energy investor Toby Neugebauer is the primary donor to Keep the Promise II. The Wilks family of energy billionaires is funding Keep the Promise III, while Keep the Promise PAC has a wide donor base.
While they can raise and spend unlimited sums, they can't coordinate with the Cruz campaign, which must comply with federally mandated donation caps. They can, however, work with each other, and the PACs' top aides, who are scattered across the country, do that through calls, email and text message.
Their goal is to reinforce each other's work. For example, a recent Keep the Promise I television ad called ""Record, Not Rhetoric"" talks about the promises Mr. Cruz kept in WashingtonThat is also a recurring theme in the pitch delivered by field organizers in South Carolina, who are paid for by Keep the Promise PAC.
More than 100 volunteers and paid workers are organizing in 10 counties in South Carolina. They aim to contact, persuade and mobilize roughly 150,000 evangelical-leaning voters across those areas -- using voter profiles compiled by the same data broker, Cambridge Analytica, that is working for the Cruz campaign itself to identify supporters.
""From their inception, most super PACs were TV-driven attack dogs,"" said Dan Tripp, the strategist running the field operation in South Carolina.
""We are running an intensive, data-driven ground game in South Carolina,"" said Mr. Tripp, a former member of the state Legislature and now a consultant specializing in turnout and field operations. ""We've got a very targeted list of primary voters that we think are going to turn out and are supportive of Sen. Cruz.""
The PACs also intend to be involved heavily in other states going forward. Each state operation is independently run by strategists who know the state, and funded by one or more of the four super PACs in the Keep the Promise network.

Cruz's Stealth Delegate Hunt --- Backers seek to dominate local GOP gatherings to win a contested convention,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774740039?accountid=12768,"MORELAND, Ga. -- Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign has been operating an under-the-radar effort to prepare for a contested Republican convention this summer, and those moves appear to be bearing fruit in places such as this Atlanta exurb.
Though front-runner Donald Trump carried Georgia's Coweta County by 12 percentage points three weeks ago, it was Cruz supporters who dominated an early stage of the arcane process of choosing the people who will serve as delegates at the Republican National Convention.
The goal: If Mr. Trump doesn't win on the first ballot -- freeing most delegates from voting for the candidate who won their state's primary or caucus -- Cruz supporters would dominate the convention, paving the way for the Texas senator to win the nomination on a later vote.
It is at events like the Coweta County Republican Convention last weekend where Mr. Cruz must prevail to have any reasonable chance of wresting the GOP nomination away from Mr. Trump. ""We started preparing to get our folks to the convention in 2015,"" said Scott Johnson, a top Cruz organizer in Georgia.
Heading into Tuesday's contests in Arizona and Utah, Mr. Trump has secured 678 delegate slots -- 255 more than Mr. Cruz, who is a distant second. Mr. Trump needs to take about 56% of the delegates in the 22 states left to allocate them to reach the 1,237-delegate threshold to win the nomination on the convention's first ballot.
Mr. Cruz's path to a first-ballot victory is far harder: He must secure 81% of the remaining delegates -- a herculean task in a three-man race given that many of the remaining states award delegates proportionally or by congressional district.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has gathered 143 delegates, has no mathematical chance of winning a first-ballot vote. His only hope is for a contested convention that turns most of the delegates bound to candidates into free agents.
But Mr. Trump's rivals have another, less visible path to influence over the national convention. In Georgia and elsewhere, the campaigns are navigating a little-known political process that occurs after each state's primary or caucus sets out how many delegate slots each candidate is allotted.
In precinct, county, district and state meetings, Republicans now are determining which people will get delegate slots at the national convention. These party activists will fill the arena floor in Cleveland and be called on to shout out the number of delegates awarded to each candidate from their state, until one hits 1,237.
At a Washington news conference Monday, Mr. Trump predicted he would win enough delegates in the remaining state votes to avoid a contested convention, but he said he has a delegate-selection team in place in case he doesn't.
""I think I'll get the votes. We'll see what happens. Maybe I won't,"" Mr. Trump told about 200 reporters at the site of a hotel he is developing five blocks from the White House.
Mr. Cruz's presidential hopes increasingly rest on a convention scenario not seen since 1948, when New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey won the GOP nomination on the third ballot. To succeed, he is relying on organizers like Brant Frost, a 25-year-old mortgage broker in Georgia who began volunteering for his campaign last July.
Mr. Frost estimates that Cruz supporters will make up 90% of Coweta County's delegates at Georgia's coming state and district gatherings, from which delegates to the national convention will be chosen. ""We're trying to get Cruz supporters there so when delegates can vote for whoever they want, they will vote for Ted,"" Mr. Frost said.
As for Mr. Kasich, for weeks his campaign had focused entirely on last Tuesday's Ohio primary. The day after he won, Mr. Kasich's aides held a five-hour meeting to adopt a strategy to secure delegate slots for supporters. The aides declined to disclose any details.
""Were plotting all that out,"" said John Weaver, Mr. Kasich's senior strategist. ""We'll have people at every state convention and at every district convention. It's going to be hand-to-hand combat.""
Meantime, Mr. Trump will try to harness the same voter energy he used to win 20 primaries and caucuses to capture seats for supporters at the national convention, said Ed Brookover, a former Ben Carson strategist who now serves as the New York businessman's head of a delegate-selection team.
""This is not difficult to figure out in any one state,"" Mr. Brookover said. ""It only sort of begins to get complicated when you're talking about 56 different places,"" he added, referring to every state and the U.S. territories that participate in the nomination contest.
Even before Mr. Trump romped to victory in Georgia's March 1 primary, Cruz supporters dominated the first stages of the complex process for selecting the state's delegation to the national convention. The Texas senator's supporters made up the preponderance of would-be delegates who on Feb. 20 attended precinct and county meetings to enroll at county conventions.
In straw polls that day conducted by the Georgia Association of Republican County Chairmen, 63% of attendees backed Mr. Cruz, compared with 13% who were Trump supporters.
It was more a measure of organizational strength than electoral clout; Mr. Trump went on to win the Georgia primary with 38.8% of the vote. Mr. Cruz was third, at 23.6%.
""A lot of Trump supporters are new,"" and so didn't know they had to be at Georgia precinct meetings a month ago, said Phoebe Hobbs, a Trump backer attending a GOP convention Saturday in Cobb County, northeast of Atlanta. ""There's a reason they are upset [with the political system]. They don't know how the party is run.""
After his primary victory, Mr. Trump sent his top Georgia organizer to Florida, an indication his campaign didn't put a premium on the post-primary delegate-selection process.
Last week, Mr. Trump's campaign tried to play catch-up. An email Thursday evening from the campaign's Georgia state director urged supporters to attend the Saturday county conventions and explained the rules.
""Just because we won the primary election, doesn't mean our job is finished,"" wrote Brandon Phillips, Mr. Trump's Georgia chief. ""Media reports indicate that career politicians and the political class are plotting to deny Mr. Trump the nomination by preventing our supporters from representing Mr. Trump as his delegates at the Republican National Convention.""
On Saturday, dozens of people arrived at the Cobb County convention without having met the party's requirement of attending prior precinct and county meetings. Most of them were likely Trump supporters.
Randy Evans, a veteran party official who was chairman of the convention, waived those and other requirements.
But it remains unclear how many of them will be able to attend the state and district conventions at which national convention delegates will be selected, because most delegate slots were already allocated.
That seemed not to matter to Trump supporters like Yvonne Malin, a 62-year-old retiree from Marietta, Ga., whose presence at the Cobb County convention marked her first attendance at such a Republican gathering.
""The country is falling apart; I don't feel safe anymore in my own country,"" Ms. Malin said, adding she is so anxious that she bought a gun for the first time.
Ms. Malin probably will qualify to be an alternate at the next-level congressional district convention in April, but she may have joined the effort too late to gain access to the state convention in May. ""I am so excited just to be here,"" she said.

Election 2016: Donors Bolstered Cruz And Rubio Last Month,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774471889?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz's fundraising continued to surge in February, while donors poured cash into the super PAC backing rival candidate Marco Rubio in the weeks before he quit the presidential race.
Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, raised nearly $12 million in February and had $8 million left to spend by the end of the month, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, leaving him in a strong financial position. But he also raced through his cash, spending $17 million last month and depleting his war chest by $5 million from the end of January.
Mr. Cruz also has the backing of super PACs that raised more than $51 million through February.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, meanwhile, raised $3.4 million last month -- three times what he raised the previous month, but still falling far short of his rivals' hauls. He also burned through his cash, leaving him with just $1.2 million in the bank at the end of the month. His allied super PAC had $2.5 million in cash on hand at the end of the month.
Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who is primarily self-funding his campaign, lent himself $6.9 million last month and raised $2 million in outside donations. He reported $1.3 million in cash on hand at the end of February, but because the billionaire has said he is willing to spend uncapped amounts on his campaign, that number is virtually meaningless.
On the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders outraised Hillary Clinton by about $14 million in February -- bringing in more than $43 million to her $29.4 million -- but he also raced through his cash, spending $41 million.
At the end of the month, Mrs. Clinton had about $14 million more left in her war chest than Mr. Sanders, leaving her in a strong position heading into the next series of primaries. Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, also has the backing of a super PAC that raised $4.9 million last month, and has more than $44 million in the bank.
The candidates' financial standings are key to their ability to try to nudge aside rivals in the coming weeks. Mr. Cruz is looking to knock Mr. Kasich out of the race and establish himself as the alternative to Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton, after a sweep through five states last Tuesday gave her a formidable delegate lead, is looking to clinch the Democratic nomination once and for all.
Efforts to take down Mr. Trump also ramped up last month. A super PAC opposing the real-estate developer raised $4.7 million in February, fueled primarily from donations from three billionaire families: Marlene and Joe Ricketts, Paul Singer and Warren Stephens. The group had $3.2 million left to spend at the end of February.
The latest filings also offered a window into why candidates like Mr. Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush quit the race in recent weeks.
Donors gave more than $25 million last month to the super PAC backing Mr. Rubio, a Florida senator who at one point was considered the candidate best equipped to take on Mr. Trump. The group, Conservative Solutions PAC, raised and spent its largest sums to date in February, as the group sought to boost him following a disappointing fifth-place finish in New Hampshire's primary and ahead of the March 1 Super Tuesday primaries.
Yet even the surge in donations to the super PAC didn't prove enough to keep Mr. Rubio in the race. Though his campaign itself reported raising $9.5 million in February -- its best fundraising month to date -- and had $5.4 million on hand at the end of the month, it churned through those funds in the following weeks.
Mr. Rubio quit the race on March 15.
While Mr. Rubio's allies drove up their spending on his behalf in his final weeks, funding dried up for Mr. Bush as his campaign neared an end. His allied super PAC, Right to Rise USA, raised just $178,632 in February -- a fraction of the staggering $103 million it had raised in the first six months of 2015. Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor, quit the race on Feb. 20.

Election 2016: Cruz Takes Aim at Rival on Border,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774293231?accountid=12768,"DOUGLAS, Ariz. -- Sen. Ted Cruz made a visit to the U.S.-Mexican border on Friday to criticize the state of border security and to make the case that he, not Donald Trump, is the best candidate to tackle illegal immigration.
Standing at a low-slung barrier, Mr. Cruz said that ""my 5-year-old could climb this in about 3 seconds.""
Mr. Cruz said that Mr. Trump has supported ""open-border Democrats"" in the past. Opposition to illegal immigration has helped propel Mr. Trump to front-runner in the Republican presidential campaign.
The March 22 Arizona winner-take-all primary, where 58 delegates are at stake, is Mr. Cruz's best shot to blunt Mr. Trump's growing momentum. Utah also votes the same day, and Mr. Cruz is headed to Provo and Draper this weekend for a campaign swing.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose more moderate position on immigration makes Arizona a tougher target, is focusing more on Utah's caucuses.
The two Western contests are also the first Republican votes since Sen. Marco Rubio left the presidential race after losing his home state of Florida to Mr. Trump last week. After Arizona and Utah, the contest moves to Northern states that are considered less hospitable to Mr. Cruz.
Arizona -- ground zero in the contentious national debate over how to deal with the illegal immigrants living in the U.S. -- is fertile ground for a fight between Messrs. Trump and Cruz over immigration policy. The state was the site of the 2010 fight over SB 1070, a bill allowing local police to enforce immigration law that was partially invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Mr. Trump has also been endorsed by two popular figures in the state known for their tough stance against illegal immigration, former GOP Gov. Jan Brewer and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
Mr. Cruz on Friday visited near the site where an American rancher was killed under mysterious circumstances. Authorities believe Robert Krentz was killed in 2010 by an illegal immigrant or drug traffickers. His death on his own ranch along the border has become a rallying cry for proponents of stricter border security and a crackdown on the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S.

Election 2016: Foreign-Policy Plans Get Sharper Focus --- Trump plays advisers close to vest; Cruz releases list of 23 security experts,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774134736?accountid=12768,"Corrections & Amplifications
Alvin Krongard is a former executive director of the Central Intelligence Agency. An Election 2016 article Friday about Republican candidates' foreign-policy plans incorrectly called him a former head of the agency. Also, Sen. Jeff Sessions was incorrectly identified as a U.S. representative.
(WSJ March 22, 2016)
Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump continues to hedge questions about his foreign-policy team even as the advisers to his two challengers are coming into sharper focus.
Meanwhile, some of Mr. Trump's stances on Russia and the Middle East are causing concern in a diplomatic corps stunned by his rise.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign on Thursday released the names of 23 national security advisers, including conservative veterans of U.S. and British foreign-policy circles. Among them: former Reagan White House adviser Elliott Abrams, former National Security Agency general counsel Stewart Baker, and former Missouri Sen. Jim Talent, who served on the armed services committee.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich previously disclosed more than 30 national security experts consulting with his campaign, including former Nixon National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen and Alvin Krongard, a former head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Trump, by contrast, has announced only one national security adviser -- Alabama Rep. Jeff Sessions. On Monday, he said the person he counts on the most is himself.
""I'm speaking with myself No. 1 because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things,"" he said in an interview on MSNBC. ""I talk to a lot of people and at the appropriate time I'll tell you who the people are.""
Pressed on who was giving Mr. Trump advice, Mr. Sessions said Thursday, ""A lot of these are private conversations as other candidates are having. Does anybody know who Kasich's advisory team is or Ted Cruz's for that matter?""
Mr. Cruz released the names of his team a few hours later. The list includes Frank J. Gaffney, identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as ""one of America's most notorious Islamophobes."" He served as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under President Ronald Reagan. The Cruz campaign didn't immediately return a request for comment.
The candidates' foreign-policy views will face increased scrutiny next week when they address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Washington's most powerful pro-Israel lobby.
Messrs. Cruz and Kasich are forming growing coteries of advisers as they woo supporters of two ex-rivals who emphasized their foreign-policy credentials. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who bowed out of the race Tuesday, and former Florida Sen. Jeb Bush, who quit last month, were backed by dozens of defense hawks who helped shape their views on Russia, China, Iran, and Israel in line with party orthodoxy.
Mr. Trump's positions, many still unformed, often break with GOP tradition but appear to be resonating with voters who say U.S. diplomatic and trade agreements cater to foreign interests.
He has proposed engaging in trade fights with Mexico and China, demanding higher payments for military protection from Japan, Germany, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, and taking oil from Iraq.
He also has urged caution toward intervening in the Middle East, saying the U.S. shouldn't have supported the ousting of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. Mr. Trump has given mixed signals on whether U.S. ground forces should be sent to fight Islamic State.
""Trump's instincts I think have been proven right,"" Mr. Sessions said Thursday at a forum sponsored by the American Council for Capital Formation, an economic and environmental policy group. ""I think his emphasis on a more realistic, pragmatic foreign policy is good.""
Mr. Sessions defended Mr. Trump's call to reset relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I think an argument can be made that there's no reason for the U.S. and Russia to be at this loggerheads,"" Mr. Sessions said.
But some diplomats in Washington are voicing concerns about what they view as Mr. Trump's xenophobic and contradictory remarks on foreign policy.
European officials are raising questions about the fealty Mr. Trump has paid to Mr. Putin, while Arab diplomats are alarmed by Mr. Trump's statements that Islam hates America and his call for a ban on Muslim immigrants.
A senior Arab official said Mr. Trump's comments have been offensive but the bigger surprise -- and disappointment -- is that he is winning.
The U.S. and Russia have a strained, combative relationship stretching back decades.
""In a fantasy world of foreign policy, we could be good friends with Putin,"" said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Principles get in the way of cozying up with dictators. So does information. But Mr. Trump has found a way around that. He simply has none.""

"Election 2016: After Wins, Cruz Sees a Two-Horse Race --- Rival Rubio, in a speech, promised to seize a home-state victory on March 15",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769404947?accountid=12768,"STAFFORD, Texas -- Sen. Ted Cruz's victory in his home state was sweet, but his win in Oklahoma was even sweeter. The twin Republican presidential primary victories gave Mr. Cruz new grounds to claim he is in the strongest position to lead the party's opposition to businessman Donald Trump.
Mr. Cruz's chief rival for second place in the GOP field, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, managed to land his first win of the primary season, in the Minnesota caucuses. But even after a big, 11th hour push in Virginia, Mr. Rubio lost there to Mr. Trump.
Mr. Rubio, in a speech to supporters in Florida on Tuesday night, promised to seize a home-state victory on March 15. For the two weeks until then, Mr. Cruz will have bragging rights as the candidate who has the most victories over Mr. Trump -- now in three states, including his earlier win in Iowa.
""This is a huge night that turns it into a two-man race,"" said Saul Anuzis, a Cruz supporter and former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""Cruz is the only person who can seriously challenge Trump, and all the other candidates have to make a tough decision.""
Even one of Mr. Cruz's harshest critics, former presidential rival Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, saw the results as a game changer. ""We may be in a position where we have to rally around Ted Cruz as the only way to stop Trump,"" Mr. Graham said in a CBS interview.
As Mr. Cruz's supporters packed in to celebrate at the Redneck Country Club, a Cruz friend's restaurant near Houston, they cheered at the early news that he had won the state. The cheers were even louder when Oklahoma was called for Mr. Cruz.
Of course, the day brought disappointments to the Cruz team because the campaign had invested heavily across the many Southern states that favored Mr. Trump on Tuesday. But the Oklahoma win offered a reminder of Mr. Cruz's strength among evangelical voters. Oklahoma has one of the highest proportions of evangelical voters, who make up about 40% of its population. According to exit polls, 38% of white evangelicals backed Mr. Cruz on Tuesday, compared with just 23% who supported Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump did far better among nonevangelical voters, 35% of whom voted for the celebrity billionaire.
Though playing on his home turf in Texas, Mr. Cruz took nothing for granted, spending Monday and Tuesday campaigning there. He marshaled endorsements from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other popular GOP officeholders.
But Mr. Trump gave him a run for his money by making one of his rare television ad buys and by holding a large rally in Fort Worth last weekend, where he unveiled the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
Mr. Cruz had also bet heavily on Oklahoma, investing time and resources just ahead of March 1. He rolled a list of endorsements there earlier this week and rallied crowds in Tulsa and Oklahoma City on Sunday. There, he criticized Mr. Trump for waffling over accepting the endorsement of David Duke, a longtime Ku Klux Klan leader.
There were 155 delegates at stake in Texas, the largest cache awarded on Super Tuesday. Mr. Cruz has called it the ""crown jewel"" of Super Tuesday and repeatedly said Tuesday was the most important day of the primary season.
Mr. Cruz appealed to fellow Republicans' state pride and their conservatism, and quoted famous words of fallen heroes of the Alamo. And he pleaded with voters across the Super Tuesday battleground to rally behind him if they wanted to stop Mr. Trump.
""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want us to give this election to Hillary Clinton, I ask you to stand with us today,"" Mr. Cruz said before casting his vote in Houston.

"Trump Rivals Turn Up Heat --- As Super Tuesday vote looms, Rubio and Cruz intensify attacks on GOP front-runner",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768525567?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's rivals launched last-ditch efforts Sunday to derail the Republican presidential front-runner's campaign, intensifying the competition ahead of voting Tuesday in 11 states that could all but seal the race's outcome.
Sen. Marco Rubio charged that Mr. Trump failed to denounce white supremacists, expanding his fevered pitch that the New York businessman is unfit to be the GOP standard-bearer.
""We cannot be a party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Mr. Rubio told hundreds of cheering supporters at Patrick Henry College, a Christian school in Purcellville, Va. ""Not only is that wrong, it makes him unelectable. How are we going to grow our party?""
Mr. Trump said earlier Sunday on CNN that ""I don't know anything about David Duke,"" a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard who flagged his support for Mr. Trump last week. Hours later, Mr. Trump tweeted, ""As I stated at the news conference on Friday regarding David Duke -- I disavow.""
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump's other main rival, chimed in on Twitter: ""You're better than this. We should all agree, racism is wrong, KKK is abhorrent.""
Mr. Cruz also attacked Mr. Trump for declining to release income tax records, saying on NBC that the real-estate developer had something to hide, possibly a connection to organized crime.
""There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported.""
Mr. Trump has said he wouldn't release his tax records because he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Asked about Mr. Cruz's mafia comments, Mr. Trump, through a spokeswoman, said, ""Lying Ted Cruz is grasping at straws because he is so far down in the polls. He is a nervous wreck.""
Mr. Rubio's attack, made in a state central to his bid to gain momentum in Super Tuesday voting, illustrated his new willingness to confront Mr. Trump. But it also highlighted the quandary Mr. Rubio faces.
The Florida senator is emerging as the favorite of the party's elected leaders and top GOP activists, yet with the anti-Trump vote fractured, Mr. Rubio can't seem to pull off a victory or deprive Mr. Trump of one.
Mr. Trump -- who won three of the last four contests -- appears headed for a near-sweep in the states awarding delegates Tuesday. He gained an important endorsement Sunday from Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a leader of the Tea Party movement and staunch foe of illegal immigration.
To slow down the New York billionaire, one or two of the three remaining top candidates must abandon their quest. Yet none seem willing to do so because each sees an advantage in the primary calendar that is tantalizingly close.
Mr. Cruz aims to win his home state of Texas on Tuesday, which could boost his delegate count; Mr. Rubio is fighting to take Florida on March 15, where the winner will pocket all the delegates.
The trouble is, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has embraced the same strategy with his state's primary, also March 15, where the winner likewise will secure all the delegates.
If no one backs down, Mr. Trump could slip past them all -- and may defeat a couple of them on their own turf. The outlook is putting major Republican donors, party leaders and elected officials in states ranging from panic to depression.
""A lot of Republicans are feeling resigned to the notion that Trump will be the nominee and then go down in flames in the general"" election, said Al Hoffman, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee who supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before he quit the race. ""It will be all over on March 15 when Trump wins big time in Florida.""
Mr. Rubio's top allies are taking a one-day-at-a-time approach, while suggesting that Messrs. Cruz and Kasich should stand down.
""People who were supporting Cruz and Kasich are starting to switch their votes to Rubio because they see it's a two-person race and they want a Republican to win the White House,"" said Rep. Barbara Comstock, who represents the district that includes the college where Mr. Rubio spoke.
Mr. Rubio, who has taken to mocking Mr. Trump's tweets, cast his decision to go negative as a last resort to prevent a ""con artist"" from taking over the Republican Party and conservative movement.
The Cuban-American senator noted that the GOP field includes another Hispanic, Mr. Cruz, and an African-American, Ben Carson, implicitly drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and disparaged Mexican immigrants.
""We are the party of diversity,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""We are going to grow this party and we are going to unify it.""
Mr. Rubio's general-election-like argument came in the first of four appearances Sunday in a state that has swung back and forth between the two parties. Virginia voted for President Barack Obama twice and elected Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, but has backed Republican majorities in the state Legislature.
A big part of Mr. Trump's success has been his domination of free media through both television interviews and Twitter postings. Mr. Trump also drew attention Sunday for re-tweeting a quote from the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini: ""It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.""
Asked on NBC if he wanted to be associated with a fascist, Mr. Trump bragged about his unprecedented reach in the GOP field on social media.
""I want to be associated with interesting quotes,"" said Mr. Trump, who has 6.4 million followers on Twitter. ""Hey, it got your attention, didn't it?""
Voters backing Mr. Rubio are divided about his anti-Trump offensive. Lauren Stevens, a 17-year-old high school senior in Ashburn, Va., said she is excited to cast her first presidential vote for Mr. Rubio but that he shouldn't ""stoop to Trump's level."" Vicky Quick, 48-year-old owner of a graphic design firm, said, ""I think it's about time he stood up and said something. Trump has changed the game, and he's got to get in the ring and fight or Trump is going to trample him.""

"Election 2016: Rubio, Cruz Release Summaries of Their Tax Filings",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768525025?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have released partial federal tax returns, putting pressure on front-runner Donald Trump to do the same.
Messrs. Rubio and Cruz posted the first two pages of their tax returns through 2014 on their campaign websites over the weekend. Those forms provide top-line data on their incomes and tax payments, but lack the detailed information about business expenses, charitable giving and investments that past candidates and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton have made public.
The limited releases are still more than Mr. Trump has unveiled. He has refused to make any of his tax returns public but said on Twitter on Saturday that there would be ""no problem"" for him to do so after the Internal Revenue Service completes an audit.
Messrs. Rubio and Cruz are in the final days of a frenzied campaign leading up to this week's Super Tuesday primaries, and the senators have seized on tax returns as a way to attempt to take down Mr. Trump.
""It is time to stop the excuses,"" Mr. Cruz said in a statement. ""Donald Trump owes it to the American people to be fully vetted, and that includes releasing his tax returns so the voters can see the full financial picture.""
Mr. Cruz's campaign questioned why Mr. Trump couldn't release past returns and speculated about whether the returns might indicate that Mr. Trump isn't as wealthy as he claims to be.
Others wonder if the senators have made a tactical misstep. ""By only releasing pages 1 and 2, Cruz and Rubio have given Trump an out if and when he should decide to publish his returns,"" said Anthony Nitti, an accountant at Withum, Smith & Brown in Aspen, Colo.
""He could release the same pages, which would certainly give us insight into his adjusted gross income, but would offer no detail about the items people are most curious about with regard to Trump: his charitable contributions and the extent and success of his various business dealings,"" he said.
In 2012, eventual nominee Mitt Romney, a co-founder of private-equity firm Bain Capital, released one full tax return in January under pressure from his rivals and another in September. This year, Mr. Romney has warned of a ""bombshell"" in Mr. Trump's returns and asked him to release them.
The partial returns from the pair of first-term senators present sharply different pictures of high-income households.
Mr. Cruz, a lawyer, and his wife, Heidi, who worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., made at least $1 million in three of the four most recent years. Much of that income came from wages and other ordinary income, and as a result, they paid a relatively high tax rate.
In 2014, they paid a 36.7% tax rate on $1.2 million in income; that includes self-employment taxes and $38,193 in taxes for household help. By the campaign's calculations, the couple paid a 32.2% effective tax rate on their income.
They had enough in investments to receive $25,362 in dividends and $12,997 in tax-exempt interest in 2014. And in 2011 and 2012, they put nearly $100,000 into retirement plans for the self-employed or small-business owners. They stopped doing that in 2013 when Mr. Cruz moved from a law firm to the Senate.
By contrast, the returns of Marco and Jeanette Rubio show a couple still facing financial strains despite high incomes. The couple earned at least $275,000 each year he has served in the Senate. The Rubios' top-earning year was 2012, when their adjusted gross income was $929,439, most of which came from business income.
The campaign said the couple's income over the years came from his Senate salary, his book deals, his legal work, his teaching at Florida International University and her business.
Since 2010, when he was elected to the Senate, the Rubios have paid more than $18,000 in interest and penalties, mostly because they hadn't paid their taxes in full by the April 15 deadline or because they failed to have enough taxes withheld during the year. Taxpayers can get automatic six-month extensions, but they must pay by April 15.
In 2014, Mr. Rubio took more than $68,000 out of a tax-deferred retirement account. Because he hadn't reached age 59 1/2, he had to pay $6,841 in additional taxes on top of regular income taxes.
""There is no doubt the Rubio family has come a long way from the days when their largest monthly expense was a check to Sallie Mae and checks were sent in the mail to pay bills with the hope the payment did not arrive before the next paycheck was deposited into their account,"" the campaign said in a statement.
In 2014, the most recent year Mr. Rubio released, the couple had $335,561 in adjusted gross income and paid $78,917 in taxes for a 23.5% tax rate. The couple has four children. Their tax bill included $6,604 in taxes for household help and they claimed a $200 tax credit for child-care expenses. That is one of the few tax breaks for parents that doesn't have an income limit.

"Election 2016: Rubio, Cruz Take On Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768101208?accountid=12768,"HOUSTON -- With time running out to snap Donald Trump's winning streak, Republican rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz turned on the front-runner Thursday with attacks aimed at undercutting his signature claim to be the toughest candidate against illegal immigration.
The last debate before SuperTuesday'sdelegate bonanza featured some of the harshest and most personal blows against Mr. Trump, who has won three of the last four nominating contests. He is favored to carry most of the 11 states awarding delegateson Tuesday, potentially tightening his grip on the nomination and further rocking the Republican political establishment he loves to skewer.
Messrs. Rubio and Cruz sought to undermine Mr. Trump's credibility with conservatives on a range of issues, including health care, the national debt, the Supreme Court and foreign policy toward Israel.
They also badgered him to release his tax returns, a demand Mr. Trump rebuffed because he said he is being audited, and questioned his Republican fidelity based on prior donations to Democrats. The tax questions came after the last Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, inserted himself into the race by calling on Mr. Trump to release his returns. ""He doesn't want to do it because presumably there's something in there that is bad,"" Mr. Cruz said.
Mr. Trump responded that he has been audited every year for about a dozen years. ""I will absolutely give my return, but . . . I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.""
The big question from the debate is whether the barrage of attacks came too late to derail Mr. Trump. There were hardly any new charges but they were distilled into a two-hour bazaar of shouting.
Mr. Rubio, who had mostly avoided directly confronting Mr. Trump previously in his campaign, led the charge by reviving a decades-old charge that has gotten little attention in this campaign: a settlement for hiring 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make way for a Trump Tower in New York City.
""You're the only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally,"" Mr. Rubio said.
The New York businessman shot back: ""I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anyone.""
The Florida senator also slammed Mr. Trump for hiring hundreds of foreign guest workers at his private Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. The New York Times reportedThursdaythat 300 U.S. residents have applied for jobs at the club since 2010 but only 17 have been hired. Meanwhile, the club has sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers in that time.
Mr. Trump said he hired foreign workers in Florida because ""you could not get help"" from Americans for part-time, seasonal jobs.
In the first debate aimed directly at a Hispanic audience, Mr. Trump didn't moderate his tone or walk back his proposal to force Mexico to build a wall to keep out illegal immigrants.Thedebate was broadcast simultaneously in English on CNN and in Spanish on Telemundo. Earlier Thursday former Mexican President Vicente Fox said flatly: ""I am not going to pay for that f---ing wall.""
When reminded of that vow, Mr. Trump became defiant. ""The wall just got 10 feet taller,"" he said.
A better prepared Mr. Rubio kept pouncing:""If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he will be using illegal immigrant labor to do it."" After Mr. Trump said he would be open to starting a trade war with Mexico, Mr. Rubio quipped, ""Your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.""
Mr. Cruz also railed against Mr. Trump not only for hiring illegal immigrants but for contributing to Democratic candidates who backed a 2013 bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to earn citizenship. ""And in 2013, when I was fighting against the ""gang of eight"" amnesty bill, where was Donald?"" Mr. Cruz demanded. ""He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity Apprentice.""
Mr. Trumpsought to defend himself by touting entrance polls in the Nevada caucuses that showed him winning 45% of the Hispanic vote, trouncing Cuban-American rivals Messrs. Cruz and Rubio. ""I will do really well with Hispanics I will do better than anyone on this stage,"" he said. ""We're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.""
But a new Washington Post/Univision News pollfound eight out of 10 Hispanic voters view Mr. Trump unfavorably, giving him the highest negative rating of any Republican candidate.
Mr. Rubio is the most popular Republican among Hispanic voters, according to the Washington Post poll. He received 27% of the vote, followed by Mr. Trump with 22% and Mr. Cruz with 19%. The survey was conducted before Mr. Bush quit the race, and he drew 12%.
In a debate earlier this month, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie mocked Mr. Rubio for repeating himself, setting off a flood ofcriticism that he was too ""robotic"" and ""scripted.""
In an attempt to turn weakness into strength, Mr. Rubio accused Mr. Trump of using the same set of talking points in his campaign stops. ""I see him repeat himself every night,"" a visibly jubilant Mr. Rubio said.
He rattled off some of Mr. Trump's lines: ""Make America great again, we're going to 'win, win, win,' he's winning in the polls . . . Every night, same thing!""
That prompted Mr. Trump to shrug and mouth: ""It's true,"" an apparent reference to his promise to deliver those things.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich tried to draw contrasts between the freshman senators and his governing record, highlighting his health care policy. ""We're actually doing it in my state,"" he said. ""This is not a theory.""
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, as usual, was overshadowed by the other candidates on stage. ""Some people say I whine a lot because I don't get time,"" he said. ""I'm going to whine I didn't get asked about taxes. I didn't get asked about Israel.""
Later, mindful of the rules that allow a candidate to respond to an accusation, he added: ""Could somebody attack me please?""

Cruz Faces Must-Win Challenge In Texas,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767833067?accountid=12768,"Texas has 155 delegates up for grabs in its Republican primary next week, but for Sen. Ted Cruz, the stakes in his home state are immeasurable.
A victory by front-runner Donald Trump in Tuesday's contest would knock the wind out of Mr. Cruz's bid for the nomination.
Three polls released this week show Mr. Cruz leading in Texas by margins of between one and 15 percentage points. But Mr. Trump's commanding win in the Nevada caucuses, his third victory in a row, means Mr. Cruz is going to have to fight that much harder on his home turf, starting with Thursday's debate in Houston.
""Trump is succeeding everywhere right now, and Texas is not immune to that,"" said Matt Mackowiak, a GOP political consultant in Austin who isn't aligned with any presidential candidate. ""If Trump were to defeat Cruz in Texas, it would be an earthquake, an absolute earthquake.""
The Lone Star state primary is one of three contests this month where Republican hopefuls must prove they can beat Mr. Trump in their home states.
The odds look long for Marco Rubio, who is trailing Mr. Trump by 21 points in Florida, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is lagging behind Mr. Trump by five points in his home state, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll.
The political peril that lies ahead was clearly on the minds of all three candidates in the wake of the Nevada results, and each tried to spin the conversation in the most positive way.
""When it comes to winning home-state primaries, John Kasich is in a far superior position when compared to Senator Rubio,"" says the Ohio governor's campaign blog.
""We'll win in Florida,"" Rubio said Wednesday on CBS after narrowly edging Mr. Cruz for second place in Nevada's caucuses. The senator told reporters earlier this week: ""We know how to run and win campaigns in Florida.""
Florida and Ohio are winner-take-all-contests on March 15. Under Texas' complex rules, Mr. Cruz likely would have to share delegates with Mr. Trump even if he gets more votes. Delegates are allocated from statewide returns and in each of the 36 congressional districts.
At a rally in Houston on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz called Texas ""the crown jewel"" of the 11 states voting Tuesday, but he stopped short of predicting victory. ""The great state of Texas now has the opportunity to stand up and speak,"" he said. ""I believe we are poised to have a very good night on Super Tuesday.""
Historically, most presidential candidates either win their home-state primaries or drop out of the race preemptively to save face. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, for instance, ended his presidential bid in December to ensure his name was removed from the ballot before its Feb. 20 primary.
There are exceptions: George H.W. Bush lost in Texas in 1980, and then-Texas Rep. Ron Paul lost there in 2008 and 2012. Neither went on to win the nomination in those years.
It is hard for Mr. Cruz to avoid the burden of high expectations. He served as solicitor general in Texas from 2003 to 2008, and he was elected to the Senate in 2012 after a primary, a runoff and general election.
On Wednesday, Gov. Greg Abbott joined former Gov. Rick Perry and legions of Texas elected officials backing Mr. Cruz. The candidate is also deploying his wife, Heidi Cruz, who is scheduled to appear at 10 events between Friday and Sunday.
""Rick Perry and Ted Cruz campaigning in Texas, that's a tough duo to beat,"" said Austin Barbour, a Mississippi-based Republican consultant who backed Mr. Bush and is now neutral. ""But it's probably a jump ball.""
Mr. Cruz may also benefit from a big wave of early voting, which ends Friday. More than 260,000 people already have voted early or by mail -- many of them before Mr. Cruz's campaign was buffeted in recent days by third-place finishes in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, and by accusations of underhanded campaign tactics that led to the firing of a top adviser.
While his competitors have spent little time in the state, they all will appear Thursday on the debate stage at the University of Houston. On Friday, Mr. Rubio will headline a rally in Dallas, while Mr. Trump will appear in Fort Worth. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is slated to campaign in Dallas and Houston on Saturday.
Mr. Trump is predicting Mr. Cruz's downfall. ""Now that [Mr. Cruz] has exposed himself as a nasty person, who lies a lot, I think he is going to go way, way down in Texas,"" Mr. Trump said Tuesday in Nevada. ""So I think we have a shot in Texas.""
Mr. Cruz has argued that Mr. Trump calls him and other rivals ""liars"" to distract from his own record.
Interviews with major Texas donors to Jeb Bush's failed campaign found scarce support for their home-state senator.
Mr. Cruz has raised 45% of his campaign money, about $27.4 million, in Texas, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Mr. Cruz's grip on the donor network in Texas is more tenuous, for example, than Mr. Bush's was in Florida, where he had locked down nearly every major top Republican fundraiser in his home state.
Several major donors said they were skeptical the Texas senator could garner enough support outside of his Christian conservative base to defeat the Democratic nominee in November.
""I think the tenor of the Rubio campaign is more inclusive and more positive, and he would have the best prospects of winning in the general election,"" said Harlan Crow, a Dallas-based real-estate developer who helped Mr. Bush and is now exclusively backing Mr. Rubio.
Mr. Cruz harbors no illusions about the fight ahead of him. At his event with Mr. Abbott Wednesday, he quoted William B. Travis, a slain hero of the Battle of the Alamo, saying: ""I shall never surrender or retreat.""

Election 2016: Cruz's Tax Plan Divides Experts,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767832346?accountid=12768,"The tax plan Sen. Ted Cruz put at the center of his presidential campaign would cause a one-time surge in consumer prices. Or maybe it wouldn't.
It would spark enormous growth -- or cause an explosion in federal debt. It would lower after-tax incomes for poor households -- or make everyone better off.
Economists, not known for unanimity, are more divided than usual on Mr. Cruz's plan, with projections that cover the spectrum from sanguine to disastrous.
This deep uncertainty shows how hard it is to weigh the impact of proposals to transform the federal tax code: The more unorthodox the plan, the tougher it is to compute the anticipated effect.
Mr. Cruz is trying to bounce back in the GOP presidential race and slow the momentum of rival Donald Trump, who has won three straight nominating contests.
The Cruz plan would replace payroll and corporate income taxes with a 10% individual income tax and a 16% business tax that would become the chief U.S. revenue source. Like his GOP rivals, Mr. Cruz offers sizable tax cuts and a shift toward taxing consumption instead of income. But he goes further. Mr. Cruz's plan could change consumer prices and relationships between workers and employers now shaped by those levies.
Forecasting how this shift would ripple through the economy depends on assumptions about who pays those taxes now and who would bear the burden of the new tax.
""It's one of the most complicated questions in economics,"" said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, publisher of Tax Notes. ""Every time you start talking about these incidences, it's like a whack-a-mole thing. You talk about one thing and it comes out the other side.""
The U.S. now taxes corporate profits at 35%. Companies deduct wages immediately but spread capital expenses over time. The cost is absorbed by shareholders and workers.
The 12.4% Social Security payroll tax is split evenly between workers and employers up to $118,500 in wages. A separate Medicare tax has no cap. Economists consider employees to bear the whole payroll-tax burden.
What Mr. Cruz calls a business flat tax -- and economists call a subtraction-method value-added tax -- simply combines corporate and payroll taxes. Businesses would deduct capital purchases immediately and pay a 16% rate without deducting wages. Removing the current cap effectively enlarges the payroll tax for high-income workers.
Those policies wouldn't cause sudden disruptions, said economist Alan Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley. ""Wages may take a while to adjust,"" he said. ""I don't think there's going to be huge immediate changes.""
But putting the whole payroll tax inside the business tax could matter because all of those taxes would be paid before nominal wages, what workers think of as base salary. That dynamic would normally lead employers to reduce wages so they aren't paying any more for the same work.
But Alan Viard, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that because employers are reluctant to lower wages, they would pass on much, but not all, of Mr. Cruz's tax in prices to their customers. The result, Mr. Viard said, would be a ""nominal rescaling of the whole economy"" with a price increase of as much as 10%.

Trump Is Killing Cruz,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767831850?accountid=12768,"Ted Cruz has to be wondering: What happened?
In the wake of his third-place finish in Nevada, Mr. Cruz's case for himself is: Don't forget Iowa. He has come a long way.
In the fall of 2013, the freshman Texas senator rolled the dice so boldly that the biggest congressional Texan of all time, Lyndon Johnson, would have been agog. Sen. Cruz, with the whole Republican Party raging at him, pulled off a shutdown of the U.S. government. He publicized the shutdown with a 21-hour speech on the Senate floor, attacking other Republicans for not joining his Pickett's charge against ObamaCare, then a federal law.
Ted Cruz knew amid this GOP chaos that he was going to run for president in 2016. He had the game plan in hand.
The plan was to make a household name for himself as the Republican Party's best-known outsider. A narrative back then held that a deep wave of anger at the party's leadership was building in the heartland. Ted Cruz was going to personally deepen the anger and then ride it.
It would surface with a victory in Iowa, which he got, build in South Carolina, and then surge through Super Tuesday and especially Texas with an unstoppable number of Cruz delegates fished from this angry Republican sea of outsiders -- tea partiers, anti-immigrant voters, pro-Snowden libertarians, evangelicals and anyone foaming mad at Barack Obama. The mad-as-hell vote.
It was a plausible primary strategy, elegant even in its mathematical inevitability, despite the crushed-glass content.
Until Donald Trump stole the whole thing.
Sen. Cruz, the self-designed outsider, is getting killed by the outsider from hell.
Somewhere in the South on Super Tuesday Sen. Cruz may yet get back on track a plan that was going to let him thumb his nose at a resentful Republican Senate from behind that big desk in the Oval Office. More likely, Ted Cruz is about to join Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, Scott Walker and Chris Christie as a Trump trophy.
But this one is different. If Ted Cruz falls, he'll take a lot of the activist right with him.
This was never a one-man show. The Cruz strategy was supported by an array of political factions whose goal was to make the Cruz candidacy a vehicle for seizing operational control of the Republican Party.
Those groups included political fundraising operations such as Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund, a variety of Web-based political entrepreneurs and white-hot radio.
Because the goal was seizing political power, the pitch to audiences wasn't complicated. It was Us versus Them. We are ""real conservatives,"" and ""they"" are not. They are ""the Establishment,"" a term made up from nothing.
The distinctions were also simple.
Immigration: We are for ""controlling the borders."" They are for ""amnesty.""
Trade: They are for trade promotion authority. Real conservatives are against TPA.
Both are serious issues, but policy details were an impediment to the takeover.
It was a kind of bitter fun while it lasted. It lasted until Donald Trump's June 2015 presidential announcement in which he said: I'm just gonna grab all of that stuff . . . and make it simpler.
The Mexican-built wall, the Muslim ban, the trade war with China, whatever. By the time we all got to South Carolina, Donald Trump had transformed Ted Cruz and the ""real conservative"" insurrection into . . . the Establishment.
He is killing them. He is reaping the politics they worked to sow -- on immigration, on trade and on inchoate anger.
Exit polls show Sen. Cruz winning a plurality of the ""very conservative"" vote. But there aren't enough ""very conservative"" voters to win anything now because Donald Trump is siphoning 33% of everything else.
The Cruz camp might argue that it has as much chance as Marco Rubio in a one-on-one contest against the Trump 33%. It's far from clear, though, that the Rubio-Bush-Kasich vote would default to Sen. Cruz. The Cruz media-support operation for years has ridiculed vast swaths of the Republican Party, including lifelong Reagan conservatives, as the abhorrent ""mainstream"" or the ""donor class.""
The goal was to separate them from Ted Cruz. It worked.
Also in pieces is the Cruz faction's takeover of the Republican Party, what's left of it. Conventional wisdom holds that the Trump insurgency is a hostile takeover of the GOP. It is not that.
Donald Trump is properly understood as running an independent candidacy from inside the formal structure of the Republican Party, as Mike Bloomberg did to run for mayor of New York City. Nothing remotely resembling a political party is associated with Mr. Trump. If he loses the nomination or the general election, he will walk away from his Republican supporters by dawn. The GOP will look like a forest shredded by a tornado.
Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich have to decide if the time has come to let Donald Trump define the Republican Party, or let the rest of the Republicans choose either him or someone else as the majority's choice for their nominee.
Sen. Cruz already offered a defined choice for the Republican Party. Donald Trump owns that version. It's a little late for Mr. Cruz's Plan B.

Election 2016: Cruz Blasts Trump as Their Feud Heats Up,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775773481?accountid=12768,"The personal feud between Republican presidential contenders Ted Cruz and Donald Trump took a nasty turn Friday with an exchange about charges of marital infidelity and a new round of insults between the two candidates' camps.
Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, used an impromptu press conference in Wisconsin to bat down a National Enquirer article that cited rumors alleging that he has cheated on his wife -- and in the process accused Mr. Trump and his ""henchmen"" of driving the piece.
Mr. Trump responded by denying any involvement in the piece.
A race that began as a conversation about immigration, economic growth and conservative strategies for helping people at the bottom rungs of the country's socioeconomic ladder is, for the moment, being dominated by the increasingly personal back-and-forth between the front-runner, Mr. Trump, and the candidate with the next-most delegates, Mr. Cruz.
The war of words about the Enquirer piece came a day after the two Republicans sparred over photos about each other's wives, an exchange in which Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump ""a sniveling coward"" for disparaging his wife. They also came two days after House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) implored members of both parties to be more civil and respectful.
In reference to the piece about marital infidelity, Mr. Cruz said in a post on his Facebook page: ""I want to be crystal clear: These attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won't go.""
That was one of several efforts Mr. Cruz made Friday to denounce the accusations -- though by commenting publicly, he thrust them directly into the campaign conversation.
In remarks to reporters in Wisconsin, Mr. Cruz called the Enquirer piece ""complete and utter lies. It is a tabloid smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen."" Mr. Cruz noted that the article quoted an on-and-off Trump political adviser, Roger Stone, who left the Trump campaign in an acrimonious split last summer.
In a Twitter post, Mr. Stone said Mr. Cruz's comments were inaccurate.
Mr. Trump released a statement denying any role in getting the Enquirer piece published. ""I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week's issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it and have not, as yet, read it,"" Mr. Trump said.
The sniping between the two candidates followed a segment Friday on CNN in which a Trump supporter accused a Republican strategist appearing on the air with her of having an affair with Mr. Cruz.
Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump, angry over a super PAC's ad mocking his wife, Melania, threatened to ""spill the beans"" on Heidi Cruz as retaliation. Mr. Cruz reacted angrily, saying he had nothing to do the with the ad.
The political dialogue between two of the three remaining Republican presidential contenders seems to typify the name calling and personal attacks Mr. Ryan decried in a speech earlier in the week.
""It did not used to be this bad, and it does not have to be this way,"" Mr. Ryan said in a Wednesday speech delivered to congressional interns. ""We shouldn't accept ugliness as the norm.""

Election 2016: Candidates' Spat Over Spouses Boils Over --- Trump and Cruz trade insults over campaign images featuring their wives; 'sniveling coward',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775708362?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- The personal feud between Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump intensified Thursday with Mr. Cruz calling the New York businessman a ""sniveling coward"" and warning him to leave family attacks out of the presidential race.
The bickering between the two leading Republicans, locked in a battle for delegates, was kicked off by an ad mocking Mr. Trump's wife and blew up into a three-day back-and-forth between the two men over the propriety of involving family members in the presidential campaign.
""It's not easy to tick me off,"" Mr. Cruz told reporters Thursday at a Wisconsin campaign stop. ""I don't get angry often. But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that will do it every time. Donald, you're a sniveling coward."" He added that Mr. Trump should leave his wife ""the hell alone.""
In advance of Utah's GOP primary this past Tuesday, a group unaffiliated with the Cruz campaign featured a racy photo from 2000 of Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, in an ad accompanied by the text: ""Meet Melania Trump, your next first lady. Or you could vote for Ted Cruz on Tuesday.""
Mr. Trump took to Twitter to express his displeasure over the ad, blaming ""Lyin' Ted"" for the spot and threatening to ""spill the beans"" on Heidi Cruz, the Texas senator's wife, in retaliation.
Mr. Trump continued his attack against Mrs. Cruz, sharing on Twitter an unflattering photo of her next to his own wife. The text ""No need to spill the beans, the images are worth a thousand words"" accompanied the photo. The ad was composed by a supporter of the real-estate developer.
The two front-runners are entering a lull in a long GOP campaign season that appears to be turning increasingly personal. Wisconsin voters head to the polls onApril 5. After that, the next major contest is New York -- Mr. Trump's home state. There are no more additional Republican debates scheduled.
Trump campaign senior adviser Stephen Miller said on CNN Thursday the unflattering photo of Mr. Cruz's wife ""speaks for itself.""
""The Cruz campaign needs to tell the super PAC and its donors to stand down,"" said Mr. Miller about the group that sparked the fight. But it isn't clear that would even be possible -- super PACs are required by law to be run independently of candidates and campaigns.
In media interviews, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz distanced themselves from the ad that sparked the controversy and said they had nothing to do with it, while Mrs. Cruz said, ""Most of the things that Donald Trump says have no basis in reality.""
""Donald, real men don't attack women. Your wife is lovely, and Heidi is the love of my life,"" Mr. Cruz said on Twitter this week.
The attacks between the two Republicans have drawn criticism from Democrats. Chelsea Clinton, who is campaigning in Wisconsin for her mother, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, addressed the back-and-forth. ""I think that the level of vitriol goes beyond anything that we certainly have seen in contemporary times in this election,"" she said, according to NBC News.
Mainstream Republicans leaders have become more vocal in their backing of Mr. Cruz in recent weeks, as party officials look for ways to stop Mr. Trump. AskedThursday if he would support Mr. Trump should the businessman become the GOP nominee, Mr. Cruz sidestepped the question and instead predicted victory. ""I'm going to beat him,"" he said. ""Donald Trump will not be the nominee.""
In an average of national polls, Mr. Trump is ahead of Mr. Cruz by 13 points, according to Real Clear Politics. In the delegate count, Mr. Cruz trails by nearly 300 delegates.

Election 2016: Cruz Gains Ground in Louisiana After Primary Loss,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775581486?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump beat Sen. Ted Cruz earlier this month in Louisiana's Republican presidential primary by 3.6 percentage points, but the Texan may wind up with as many as 10 more delegates from the state than the businessman.
Mr. Cruz's supporters also seized five of Louisiana's six slots on the three powerful committees that will write the rules and platform at the Republican National Convention and mediate disputes over delegates' eligibility this summer in Cleveland.
The little-noticed inside maneuvering that led to this outcome in Louisiana is another dramatic illustration of the inside game that could have an outsize influence on the bitter race for the GOP nomination. A similar process played out three weeks ago in Coweta County, Ga.
While Mr. Trump leads in winning primary and caucus elections, and has won more delegates, the Cruz campaign is proving superior at the arcane game of picking the people who will be the actual delegates to the convention, where they will help write the rules and ultimately choose the nominee.
That means that if Mr. Trump fails to reach the delegate threshold to claim the GOP nomination on the convention's first ballot, committees dominated by Cruz supporters could work to block him from winning enough delegates to claim the nomination on any subsequent ballots.
Kay Kellogg Katz, a Trump supporter who sought unsuccessfully to win a position on a key panel at the convention, summarized the Trump campaign's predicament this way: ""I do not know Mr. Trump, I do not know his staff people. Quite frankly, we don't have much of a campaign in Louisiana. All we have is voters.""
In other states, Trump supporters have missed out on the early process of becoming convention delegates because they are inexperienced in the party processes. But in Louisiana, Mr. Trump won broad support among elected officials despite a bare-bones campaign infrastructure. Still, he has lagged behind on delegate selection.
With 20 states left to vote, Mr. Trump has won 739 delegates out of 1,237 required to clinch the nomination. He has to win about 55% of the remaining delegates to avoid a contested convention.
Stacking the convention and its committees with supporters is critical for Mr. Cruz, because a contested convention is his only viable path to the nomination. The Texan must win 85% of the remaining delegates to win outright, a highly unlikely scenario with many states awarding delegates proportionally.
The Trump campaign's first problem is in the overall delegate count from Louisiana. Messrs. Trump and Cruz each won 18 delegates apiece based on the Louisiana results in the primary on March 5. But the five delegates awarded to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are now free agents because he ended his campaign, and Louisiana Republicans expect them to swing behind Mr. Cruz.
Meanwhile, the state's five unbound delegates -- who are free to back the candidates of their choice -- also are more likely to back Mr. Cruz than Mr. Trump, according to GOP officials in the state.
The second step in the process is for those delegates to decide who will represent Louisiana on the three important convention committees -- rules, credentials and the party platform. To make those choices, most of Louisiana's delegates gathered at a March 12 state convention to elect two members to each panel.
No Trump backers won any of those slots. Five of the six committee members chosen back Mr. Cruz, and the sixth is uncommitted. Louisiana is the first state to name delegates to serve on the three committees.
Those panels would become critical in a contested convention, which would take place if no candidate wins a majority of delegates on the first ballot. The rules panel will determine which candidates are eligible to be nominated for president, the platform panel will write the party's agenda, and the credentials panel will mediate disputes about which delegates can be seated. Such fights are already taking place in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, and may happen as well elsewhere.
Ms. Katz, a former state legislator from Monroe, La., sought a position on the credentials committee. She lost a 22-5 vote to Kim Fralick, a Cruz supporter who has never before been involved in a major political campaign.
Ms. Katz, who said she has attended every GOP convention since 1984, said the Cruz forces out-organized Mr. Trump's campaign, whom she said showed no concern about helping their supporters win the committee slots.
Ms. Fralick, a veterinarian from the Baton Rouge suburb of Central, said she was asked by a Cruz official if she could serve on the panel, which entails arriving in Cleveland days before the convention begins. ""They were looking for someone who could come up a week early,"" Ms. Fralick said. ""I might have been a default choice.""
Ed Brookover, the Trump official leading the campaign's delegate team, said Thursday that he wasn't aware that the Trump campaign had been shut out of Louisiana's committee slots. He expressed optimism that ""other spots where this is taking place, we now have programs and plans in place to make sure that Mr. Trump's supporters are getting to county, district and state conventions.""
Mr. Brookover added that ""the good news is that when we let Mr. Trump's supporters know about these things, they are enthusiastic and go running to them.""

Election 2016: Cruz Utah Win Doesn't Alter Landscape --- Texas senator picks up Bush and Club for Growth endorsements but trails in delegates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775703362?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- The split decision from Arizona and Utah on Tuesday leaves the Republican presidential race in the same place it has been: front-runner Donald Trump with a commanding lead, and Sen. Ted Cruz and the GOP establishment in a desperate effort to stop him from clinching the nomination outright.
Mr. Trump's Arizona primary victory led to unlikely support Wednesday for Mr. Cruz, who won the Utah caucuses. The Texas senator, who built his campaign around how much he is hated by the Washington establishment, on Wednesday was endorsed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the Club for Growth, the antitax organization that had never before endorsed a presidential candidate.
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who hasn't endorsed a candidate since ending his own presidential campaign in September, signaled Wednesday he is likely to endorse Mr. Cruz.
""For the sake of our party and country, we must move to overcome thedivisiveness and vulgarity Donald Trump has brought into the political arena, or we will certainly lose our chance to defeat the Democratic nominee and reverse President [Barack] Obama's failed policies,"" Mr. Bush said in his endorsement of Mr. Cruz.
Other prominent GOP activists, such as commentator Erick Erickson, have called on Republicans like Mr. Walker and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ben Sasse of Nebraska to coalesce behind Mr. Cruz as the party's last hope to stop Mr. Trump.
Even if they do so this week, it may be too late.
Mr. Walker, whose state will hold its primary on April 5, said in a radio interview aired Wednesday that he is likely to endorse next week, ""when it will have maximum impact.""
In the same radio interview, he said Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the final competitor in the race, has fallen too far behind and doesn't have a chance to become the party's presidential nominee.
""If you're someone who's uneasy with the front-runner, right now there's only one candidate, I think if you're just looking at the numbers objectively: Ted Cruz,"" Mr. Walker said in the interview with Milwaukee radio host Charlie Sykes.
Mr. Cruz echoed that sentiment in a series of television interviews Wednesday and during a campaign stop in New York City.
""As long as Republicans continue to unite behind our campaign, we will beat Donald Trump, either by getting 1,237 before the convention, or if both of us come into the convention with a bunch of delegates short of 1,237, we win by continuing to unite Republicans,"" Mr. Cruz said during an interview on the Fox Business Network.
And Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Mr. Bush who is now a top adviser to Our Principles PAC, the super PAC devoted to stopping Mr. Trump, said Wednesday that former rivals like Mr. Rubio should now endorse Mr. Cruz.
Despite Mr. Cruz's continued insistence that he has a credible path to win 1,237 delegates before the convention, that scenario becomes less likely with each succeeding contest.
With his victory Tuesday in Arizona's winner-take-all primary, Mr. Trump has now won 739 delegates out of 1,237 required to clinch the GOP nomination. With 20 states remaining, the New Yorker needs to win 498 delegates to become the party's nominee, about 55% of the outstanding delegates.
Mr. Cruz took all 40 of Utah's delegates, yet his already steep path to the nomination outside of a contested convention became even rockier. He must win 85% of the outstanding delegates.
To get to a contested convention, Mr. Cruz must win coming contests in Wisconsin -- where each of the state's eight congressional districts is winner-take-all -- and perform well in the late-April primaries in the Northeast, Mr. Trump's backyard.
The contests after Wisconsin are not on friendly terrain for Mr. Cruz. Mr. Trump remains popular among New York Republicans who vote April 19,and while competing in Iowa's caucuses, Mr. Cruz mocked Mr. Trump's ""New York values.""
Mr. Kasich justified his candidacy in remarks to a Wisconsin crowd Wednesday, saying he is ""the only one who can compete in the East.""
The governor expressed his sentiment after he received fewer votes in Arizona than Mr. Rubio, whose campaign has been over for a week.
Mr. Kasich did campaign in Utah, but received just 17% in the state's caucuses. He now has won just one primary, his home state of Ohio, and placed second in only two others in six weeks of presidential nominating contests.
Mr. Trump had a relatively quiet day Wednesday. He didn't hold any public events and didn't appear on cable television. After his victory in Arizona Tuesday, Mr. Trump, on Twitter, reiterated his call for the GOP to accept him as its new leader.
""Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!"" Mr. Trump wrote.

"Election 2016: Wisconsin to Test Cruz, Sanders --- Anti-Trump trend favors Texan, history of progressives bodes well for Democrat",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775087431?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin's primary, up next on the presidential nominating calendar, presents a key test for the second-place Democratic and Republican candidates: If Sens. Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz can't win there, they face a diminishing belief that they can win in states that follow.
That is because both Mr. Cruz, who is chasing GOP front-runner Donald Trump, and Mr. Sanders, who lags behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic delegate count, hold distinct advantages in Wisconsin.
With two weeks between Tuesday's contests in Arizona and Utah and Wisconsin's vote on April 5, the candidates will be able to put down roots in a way they haven't since before the February contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
Among the GOP, the action has already started. Mr. Cruz is scheduled to appear at a forum Wednesday in Waukesha County, a suburban Milwaukee area that is home to the state's largest concentration of GOP voters and crucial to any Republican's electoral hopes. He also announced four additional stops Thursday and Friday in Madison and the Fox Valley, the GOP-rich area between Milwaukee and Green Bay.
To stress the importance of Wisconsin, the Cruz campaign put out a call for volunteers to come to the state to establish a ""Camp Cruz,"" which it hadn't done since South Carolina's Feb. 20 primary.
""Cruz has an opportunity, but he also has a lot of work to do because most Wisconsinites don't know a lot about him,"" said Mark Graul, a veteran Republican operative from Green Bay who organized the state for George W. Bush in 2004.
The state will award 42 Republican delegates and 86 pledged to the Democrats.
For Mr. Trump, Wisconsin's population distribution poses a particular disadvantage. He is highly unpopular in the Milwaukee area, where local conservative talk-radio hosts have been lamenting his rise for months.
An analysis by Marquette Law School of its recent poll, publishedSaturdayin the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, found Mr. Trump is viewed positively by just 25% and negatively by 64% of GOP voters in the three suburban counties that ring Milwaukee. But in nearly three dozen rural counties in the state's west and north, the picture is reversed: Mr. Trump's favorable ratings are 21 percentage points higher than his negative ones.
""In southeast Wisconsin, the local conservative talk-radio hosts have not followed the lead of the national guys,"" said Charlie Sykes, who regularly criticizes Mr. Trump on his morning radio show in Milwaukee and is hosting Mr. Cruz at the Wednesdayforum in Waukesha. ""Trump has not had the talk-radio air cover here that he's had elsewhere.""
Mr. Trump's Wisconsin footprint is light, and no significant elected official in the state backs his campaign. Mr. Trump's aides didn't respond to a request for his Wisconsin endorsements.
But the New Yorker in recent weeks suggested putting a Wisconsinite on the Supreme Court: Judge Diane Sykes of the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The George W. Bush appointee used to be married to Mr. Sykes, the radio host.
Almost the entire state GOP backed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's presidential bid, which he terminated in September amid low poll numbers. Mr. Walker hasn't endorsed a candidate since, and declined an interview request.
For the Democrats, the latest polling shows an even race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator is extremely popular among liberals in and around Madison, where he held his first major rally, drawing 20,000 people in July. Wisconsin's demographics also tend to mirror those in neighboring Michigan and Minnesota, both of which Mr. Sanders won.
Also helping Mr. Sanders is Wisconsin's history of backing liberal mavericks, going back to Sen. ""Fighting"" Bob La Follette, who founded the progressive movement a century ago. ""Time and time again in Democratic primaries we go for the person who is much more out there on the progressive end of it,"" said Thad Nation, who was an aide to the state's last Democratic governor, Jim Doyle.
Mrs. Clinton has her own strength in Milwaukee, home to the vast majority of the state's blacks and Hispanics.
And while Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have focused their ire of late on Mr. Trump, in Wisconsin they both figure to take aim at Mr. Walker, who remains a highly polarizing figure despised by activist Democrats.
""Just mentioning Scott Walker will light a room on fire,"" said Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, who hasn't endorsed a candidate. ""For the base, that's filet mignon wrapped in bacon.""

Election 2016: Key Cruz Backer Poised to Open Spigot --- Cautious spending so far by super PACs leaves the senator in a strong position,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772681648?accountid=12768,"Houston investor Toby Neugebauer gave $10 million to a super PAC backing Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz last April. Eleven months later, that group still has $9 million sitting in the bank.
Mr. Neugebauer said he wanted to wait to spend his money when it would count, and that moment is now arriving. ""You knew for Ted to win this was not going to be a coronation,"" he said in an interview. ""There has never been a reason to think this was going to be quick and easy.""
Thanks to cautious spending by his allied super PACs, Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, now stands in the strongest position among his rivals, both financially and in his delegate count, to become the party's chief rival to front-runner Donald Trump, who is mostly self-financing his primary bid.
But Mr. Neugebauer's tight grip on his cash has also been a source of frustration to the rest of the pro-Cruz funding network, which last week hired a fundraiser to bolster its coffers.
The super PACs backing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich have blown through cash in recent months and are emptying their coffers ahead of a set of winner-take-all primaries on Tuesday in their home states that will determine whether they have a future in the race.
Mr. Cruz's allies, meanwhile, have spent more prudently, focusing as much on building a ground game and voter-turnout program as on TV ads, which are expensive and have proved historically ineffective this election.
As a result, the pro-Cruz groups now have the most money banked of any Republican's super PAC, with more than $25 million left to spend at the end of January, according to the most recent filings with the Federal Election Commission. His campaign has also surpassed his rivals' fundraising, bringing in about $15 million in the past five weeks -- nearly doubling its January haul.
Now, as the GOP primary looks poised to become a two-man race, Mr. Neugebauer said he would be ready to start spending in earnest. ""The race basically today is almost starting anew and Ted's down 100 delegates -- and the race doesn't end until June,"" he said.
Mr. Neugebauer's super PAC has spent about $1 million, most of which has gone to Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm -- owned in part by hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, another Cruz super PAC donor -- that offers ""psychographic"" analysis related to the personalities and values of voters. Mr. Neugebauer hasn't spent any money on ads.
Among the other super PACs in the network, however, frustration has mounted with Mr. Neugebauer's frugality, according to interviews with aides and donors to the groups. Earlier this month, he said he would draw on his account ahead of March 15 primaries -- yet he has so far invested no money on ads in those states.
Florida, Ohio, Missouri, North Carolina and Illinois will vote Tuesday in primaries with outcomes that could extend the GOP battle or begin bringing it to an end. If Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich lose, they each will be out of the race.
Mr. Neugebauer also rarely participates in the network's daily strategy calls, the aides and donors said. Mr. Neugebauer disputed that, saying he regularly discussed strategy with ""all the players"" this past week. He also pointed to the $1 million he has spent.
As they wait for Mr. Neugebauer to begin spending, the rest of the pro-Cruz network is shifting its strategy to gear up for the final battle.
This week, Chip Roy -- former chief of staff to Mr. Cruz -- signed on to lead a new super PAC helming the network of groups backing Mr. Cruz. The group, called Trusted Leadership PAC, also hired an Austin, Texas-based fundraiser this month to help drive donations.
Initially, Mr. Cruz's allies had formed a set of four super PACs, all named a variation of ""Keep the Promise"" and each backed by a different wealthy family, including the Wilks family of fracking billionaires and Mr. Mercer. Together, the groups raised $38 million in the first half of 2015. The addition of Trusted Leadership PAC is intended to ""consolidate and focus our PAC efforts,"" Mr. Roy said in an interview.
Yet coordinating strategy across four different groups, with the funds controlled by each donor family, is difficult, particularly as the stakes rise.
The feeling among Mr. Cruz's allies, for now, appears to be cautious optimism. ""Chip Roy didn't just quit his job this morning because he thought Ted was going to lose,"" Mr. Neugebauer said.
But -- like many major donors in the 2016 race -- Mr. Neugebauer is waking up to the reality that Mr. Trump could end up at the top of his party's ticket. If that is the case, he said, he will back the real-estate billionaire.
""The Washington establishment has lost the right to rule,"" he said.

"Election 2016: Trump, Cruz Break From the Pack --- Weekend results add pressure on Rubio and Kasich to drop out if they lose at home",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770814989?accountid=12768,"The race for the Republican presidential nomination looks increasingly like a two-man contest between front-runner Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz after the pair split four contests over the weekend.
The results ratchet uppressure on the two remaining candidates -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- to exit the race if they don't come out on top in winner-take-all primaries in their respective home states on March 15. Mr. Rubio got a boost Sunday with a convincing win in the Puerto Rico primary.
Mr. Cruz on Saturday won GOP caucuses in Kansas and Maine and finished a closer-than-expected second to Mr. Trump in both the Louisiana primary and Kentucky caucus. The Texas senator, backed by a state-of-the-art voter-turnout operation, also trimmed the front-runner's delegate lead ever so slightly.
In contrast, Mr. Rubio finished a distant third in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana and was the only Republican not to claim a delegate in Maine because he fell short of the 10% threshold required to qualify.
Mr. Trump late Saturday called on Mr. Rubio to step aside so that the businessman could square off in a head-to-head contest with Mr. Cruz.
""I think it's time for Marco to clean the deck,"" Mr. Trump said Saturday in West Palm Beach, Fla. ""I think it's time now that he drop out.""
The Rubio camp has pushed back hard against any suggestion that he exit the race. The senator himself is predicting victory in Florida on March 15, and he told a group in Puerto Rico on Saturday night ""this map only gets better for us"" as the contest progresses.
Rubio aides point out that, although Mr. Cruz has more wins, their candidate outpaced him in more populous primary states, including Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia.
But public-opinion surveys suggest Messrs. Rubio and Kasich both have a lot of ground to make up. Mr. Trump boasts a double-digit lead in Michigan, which votes Tuesday, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll, followed by Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio and then Mr. Kasich.
Public polling in Florida and Ohio isn't recent enough to reflect the current standings in the race, but an internal poll conducted for a group trying to deny Mr. Trump the nomination showed Mr. Rubio within striking distance of the front-runner. The Cruz campaign is trying to peel votes away from the home-state senator by opening 10 campaign offices in Florida.
Mr. Kasich has expressed doubts that any of the four remaining Republicans would collect the 1,237 delegates required to claim the nomination before the party descends on Cleveland for its convention in July. Eager to justify his decision to stay in the race after failing to win a single contest, Mr. Kasich seemed to relish the potential chaos.
""Think about how much education our kids are going to get, about the way in which we pick a president,"" he said in an ABC interview Sunday. ""I think it will be very cool.""
The chief strategist for Mr. Kasich's campaign circulated a memo over the weekend arguing the calendar gets more favorable for the Ohio governor as the race moves northwest, making the case that Mr. Cruz needed to get more delegates from the mostly Southern and caucus states that voted early this year. ""No candidate is currently on track to win the nomination outright,"" wrote John Weaver, Mr. Kasich's top strategist. ""Our campaign is built for the long-term.""
Mr. Trump's detractors have stepped up their efforts in recent weeks to blunt his momentum.The party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, delivered an extraordinary speech last week in which he savaged Mr. Trump's character and ridiculed his business success, asserting the billionaire inherited his father's construction company rather than built one.
Our Principles Project, an outside group financed by some of the party's biggest donors, is in the middle of a $3.5 million advertising blitz in Florida and Illinois, which also votes on March 15.
Florida and Ohio present the remaining contenders with sprawling battlegrounds that tend to require multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns. Mr. Trump has been able to forgo those political ads in earlier contests because of the saturation coverage of his campaign, a trend likely to continue.
Despite trailing Mr. Trump in most public polls, Mr. Rubio should benefit from a proven network of support in the Sunshine State. In the earlier contests, he has outpaced his rivals with those voters who decided closer to the voting.
Mr. Cruz was able to nearly catch Mr. Trump in Louisiana when voters on Saturday began breaking his way. The New York businessman managed to hold on because of a wide winning margin with those who had cast their ballots before Election Day.
In Florida, early in-person voting started last week in some of the state's most populous counties. As of Feb. 24, about 430,000 absentee ballots already were cast, including 224,000 by Republicans, state records showed.
Mr. Rubio must ""remind people why they voted for him in 2010,"" said Tre' Evers, a Republican political consultant in Orlando who initially backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before joining the Rubio camp.

Election 2016: Walker Backs Cruz Ahead of Primary,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776593755?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for president, a major boost for Mr. Cruz ahead of next week's Wisconsin Republican primary.
Mr. Walker, who quit the presidential primary race last fall, said in an interview with WTMJ radio host Charlie Sykes that Mr. Cruz is a ""constitutional conservative"" who is willing to ""take on the big-government special interests."" The governor said Mr. Cruz was best equipped to beat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the fall.
Mr. Walker's endorsement of Mr. Cruz was expected. He has expressed skepticism about front-runner Donald Trump, and he said last week that Ohio Gov. John Kasich ""cannot"" win the nomination.
The stakes are high for Mr. Cruz as Wisconsin prepares to vote on April 5. If Mr. Cruz loses that state to Mr. Trump, he will face a diminishing belief that he can win in the states that follow. Mr. Walker said he planned to join Mr. Cruz on the campaign trail in Wisconsin this week.
Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that he didn't expect to receive Mr. Walker's endorsement.
The Walker move is the latest signal from GOP leaders they are willing to back a conservative firebrand who has been a thorn in their side -- instead of Mr. Trump. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush endorsed Mr. Cruz last week.
The endorsement is also a blow to Mr. Kasich, who has so far failed to coalesce any establishment support, despite the recent departures from the race of rivals Mr. Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

""His lack of ability and readiness to protect this country was evident, so Donald did what he always does, he tried to find a way to change the subject,"" Mr. Cruz said on Fox News Sunday.
""Donald is out of his depth, he doesn't understand these issues. . . He has no answers for how to keep America safe from radical Islamic terrorism so instead, he attacks my wife, he attacks my family, he goes to garbage, and sleaze and lies.""
The battle between Mr. Trump, the GOP front-runner, and Mr. Cruz, who is second in the race for convention delegates, has taken on an increasingly nasty, personal character in recent weeks.
Ahead of the March 22 Utah caucuses, an anti-Trump super PAC used a racy photograph of Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, shot during her career as a model, to mock her. In response, Mr. Trump last week threatened to ""spill the beans"" on Mr. Cruz's wife, Heidi, and retweeted a photo that showed Mrs. Trump alongside an unflattering picture of Mrs. Cruz.
On Friday, Mr. Cruz accused Mr. Trump of planting a false story in the National Enquirer alleging Mr. Cruz had carried on extramarital affairs. On Sunday, Mr. Cruz said the National Enquirer's chief executive was a close friend of Mr. Trump's, and noted that the paper had endorsed the New York businessman. Mr. Trump denied having any connection to the story.
Mr. Trump blamed Mr. Cruz for starting the spat. ""They make me like the bad guy here.I'm just responding to what he does,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday. ""He's the one that started it. He knew about the picture.""
Mr. Cruz said Sunday he had no knowledge of the ad and didn't know the group responsible for it. He said the race had taken its current personal turn after Mr. Trump questioned whether America should maintain its position within NATO, which Mr. Cruz described as a ""catastrophically foolish proposition"" that would ""hand a massive victory"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Islamic State militants.

Ted Cruz's Distortions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777413338?accountid=12768,"Ted Cruz keeps saying he wants to unite the Republican Party's factions to defeat Donald Trump. But you wouldn't know it from his campaign in Wisconsin, where his Super Pac is aiming its fire at John Kasich.
Exhibit A is the false ad that the Super Pac Trusted Leadership is running nonstop in Wisconsin that accuses Mr. Kasich of being funded by liberal baron George Soros. ""Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling [Kasich's] super PAC,"" the ad says as the text ""Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros"" flashes on the screen.
This claim is as dishonest as Mr. Trump's charge that the Texas Senator is owned by Goldman Sachs because his wife worked for the New York bank. Mr. Soros hasn't donated a penny to the Kasich campaign. The alleged ""millionaires"" bankrolling the governor are Stanley Druckenmiller, who helped manage Mr. Soros's Quantum Fund between 1988 and 2000, and former Soros Fund Management chief investment officer Scott Bessent, who left the fund last year.
According to the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Druckenmiller has contributed $450,000 to the Kasich Super Pac New Day for America. Mr. Bessent has chipped in $200,000. The implication of the ad is that both businessmen are liberal by their Soros association, as if all Americans should be accountable for their employer's politics.
Messrs. Druckenmiller and Bessent have donated mainly to GOP candidates, reflecting their belief in free-market policies. Mr. Druckenmiller donated $103,375 to the Jeb Bush Super Pac Right to Rise USA and $123,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee last year.
The Cruz ad is also counterproductive if he wants to win the nomination at the GOP convention -- or the Presidency in November. The Real Clear Politics average shows Mr. Cruz running three points ahead of Mr. Trump and leading Mr. Kasich by 14 points in Wisconsin. Instead of whacking Mr. Kasich, the Texan should target Mr. Trump so the New Yorker finishes third. This would deny Mr. Trump more delegates and would hurt his narrative that his nomination is inevitable.
Mr. Cruz also needs Mr. Kasich to peel away delegates from Mr. Trump in the eastern primaries later this month where the Texan is often third in the polls. Mr. Cruz finished a distant fourth behind Marco Rubio and Mr. Kasich in Massachusetts and Vermont, and outside the Maine caucuses he hasn't won more than 12% of the vote anywhere in the Northeast.
Mr. Cruz wants to force Mr. Kasich out of the race so the Texan is the only alternative to Mr. Trump. That's also why he attacked Marco Rubio in Florida, where Mr. Cruz had no chance of winning. But he shouldn't overestimate his appeal. Wisconsin Republicans may give him a victory to stop Mr. Trump, but millions are doing it while holding their nose. The best argument Mr. Trump still has, amid his many mistakes, is that Mr. Cruz is emerging as his main opponent.
Mr. Cruz isn't likely to get enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot at the Cleveland convention, so he will need the help of many of the Republicans his campaign has done so much to alienate the last two years. His smear of John Kasich underscores the doubts that he's too divisive to win in November.",2016-05-05
Election 2016: Trump Faces Challenge in Wisconsin --- State's voter-turnout history could be an advantage for Republican rival Cruz,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778075876?accountid=12768,"GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Wisconsin Republicans could be Donald Trump's worst nightmare: a sophisticated electorate guided by a conservative political network that has honed its tactics during 13 state Senate and two statewide recall elections held since Republican Scott Walker became the governor five years ago.
Mr. Trump has built a formidable delegate lead in the Republican presidential primary by appealing to people who are infrequent voters. But they are a rarity here -- especially in the vote-rich counties that ring Milwaukee and form the core of the state GOP base.
During the 2012 general election, Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington counties each saw turnout of 79% or more. Only one county in the state saw turnout less than 55%, according to the state's Government Accountability Board.
""Wisconsin has been through a lot of challenging elections, so people are up on the issues,"" said Alberta Darling, a Republican state senator from the Milwaukee suburb of River Hills who survived a 2011 recall after backing Mr. Walker's repeal of collective bargaining rights for most of the state's public employees.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz barnstormed the state on Sunday, beginning with a Green Bay rally where he was introduced by Mr. Walker, who didn't say Mr. Trump's name but said the state's Republican voters won't be easily swayed.
""No matter what anybody says coming into the state, we are well-informed,"" Mr. Walker said.
At stake in Tuesday's Wisconsin primary are 42 delegates to the Republican National Convention. Mr. Trump retains a commanding delegate lead, with 736, compared with 463 for his closest rival, Mr. Cruz. A Republican needs to win 1,237 delegates to become the party's nominee. Wisconsin polls show Mr. Cruz holding sizable leads over Mr. Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
Mr. Trump on Sunday called for Mr. Kasich, who is a distant third in the delegate hunt with 142, to end his campaign. ""He's not taking Cruz's votes; he's taking my votes,"" Mr. Trump told reporters in Milwaukee.
Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said no Republican candidate will win the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the nomination before the Republican National Convention in July. ""We look forward to Trump dropping out before the convention,"" Mr. Schrimpf said.
In addition to a GOP electorate educated on conservative issues, Mr. Cruz has another hidden advantage: Republican voters here show up. Of 10 presidential swing states tracked in a 2012 Bipartisan Policy Center report, only Wisconsin had more than 70% voter turnout in each of the last three presidential elections.
And Milwaukee's conservative talk radio hosts have taken a victory lap in the national media after treating the Republican front-runner to a series of rough interviews, touting themselves as the bulwark of the anti-Trump forces.
But if Wisconsin hands Mr. Trump a defeat Tuesday, it will be because of voters such as Ed Perkins, a 75-year-old retiree in Grand Chute.
Always interested in politics, Mr. Perkins said he first became involved in conservative causes to defend Mr. Walker and Republican state senators during the recall elections of 2011 and 2012. He now leads a local tea-party group and on Friday hosted a Cruz campaign event featuring Mr. Cruz's father, Rafael, at a restaurant in Appleton.
""People like myself have become more knowledgeable about what's going on,"" said Mr. Perkins. ""The result of that, of all the candidates, we feel Ted Cruz is the constitutional candidate in front of us.""
The Cruz campaign has invested more resources and energy in Wisconsin than has Mr. Trump's. There are 14 Cruz field offices across the state, compared with two for Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz's campaign and his supportive super PAC have blanketed local conservative talk radio with advertisements, while Mr. Trump hasn't.
At his stops across the state this weekend, Mr. Cruz argued that his Wisconsin momentum shows he has become the choice of the party's non-Trump majority. In Green Bay on Sunday he warned that a Trump nomination would lead to a double-digit general election victory for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner.
""What we're seeing is the 65 to 70% of Republicans who don't want to see that happen are uniting and coming together behind this campaign,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""Wisconsin is the battleground.""

"Trump in Control After Cruz Exits --- Sanders beats Clinton, though his win will do little to disrupt her path to Democratic nomination",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786422422?accountid=12768,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Donald Trump almost certainly snared the Republican Party's presidential nomination by winning a sweeping victory in Indiana's primary Tuesday and forcing his chief rival from the race.
Mr. Trump's decisive victory didn't mathematically clinch the GOP nomination, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's departure from the campaign means all that stands between the first-time candidate and accepting the party's nomination in Cleveland is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has won just one state out of 41 so far.
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus quickly rallied behind Mr. Trump, calling him the presumptive nominee in a tweet. ""We all need to unite and focus on defeating"" Hillary Clinton, he tweeted.
In his victory rally remarks in New York, Mr. Trump himself seemed surprised that the last significant roadblock to his nomination was gone. ""I didn't expect this,"" he said. ""I didn't expect it.""
His triumph comes at the tail end of a nominating contest that has defied convention, splintered the party, and left nearly two-thirds of all general election voters with a negative view of Mr. Trump heading into his expected general-election showdown with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.
Nationwide, Mr. Trump is viewed unfavorably by 65% of voters, according to last month's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. That is higher than Mrs. Clinton, who is seen unfavorably by 56% of voters.
In Indiana's Democratic contest, Mrs. Clinton lost to rival Bernie Sanders. However, the Vermont senator's victory margin wasn't large enough to disrupt her path toward her party's nomination.
In dropping out of the race, Mr. Cruz conceded he couldn't stop Mr. Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the GOP nomination at the party's July convention.
With a sweep of Indiana's 57 delegates, Mr. Trump needs just 225 more. With nine states to go, including Nebraska and West Virginia next week and California on June 7, Mr. Trump needs less than half of the remaining bound delegates to become the nominee.
For Mr. Cruz, Tuesday's contest had been his strongest opportunity to change the momentum of the GOP campaign. His team for weeks had pointed to the Midwestern state, comparing it to Wisconsin, where the Texas senator won a convincing victory over Mr. Trump last month.
But Mr. Cruz never gained traction in the state. A series of decisions designed to boost his prospects, including naming Carly Fiorina as his running mate, were seen by many voters more as acts of desperation than smart maneuvers.
In a concession speech in Indianapolis, Mr. Cruz didn't mention or congratulate Mr. Trump. He said he had planned to stay in the race as long as he saw a path to the convention.
""Tonight, I'm sorry to say, it appears that path has been foreclosed,"" he said. ""Together, we left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we've got. But the voters chose another path. And so with a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism for the long term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.""
Mr. Kasich's campaign on Tuesday said it would continue until Mr. Trump officially clinches the nomination, which can't happen until California and four other states hold primaries June 7. ""Ted Cruz ran a strong campaign, stood for conservative principles, and exposed a lot about Donald Trump,"" Kasich strategist John Weaver said. ""Gov. Kasich will continue to campaign and offer the voters a clear choice for our country.""
Katie Packer, who leads an anti-Trump super PAC that spent $1.3 million against Mr. Trump in Indiana, said her group will continue to fight against the front-runner. ""There is more than a month before the California primary -- more time for Trump to continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters,"" she wrote.
Mr. Trump, in victory remarks at Trump Tower in New York that were unusually subdued, hewed to his central campaign message of rescinding international trade deals and promising to create jobs -- in this case for coal miners in West Virginia, which holds the next primary contest May 10.
He congratulated Mr. Cruz for being ""one hell of a competitor"" and called the senator's family ""beautiful,"" just hours after accusing Mr. Cruz's father of being complicit in John F. Kennedy's assassination.
""Our theme is very simple,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's make America great again. We will make America great again. We will start winning again. You will be so proud of this country very, very soon.""
With his hold on the GOP nomination seen as inevitable, Mr. Trump would become the first candidate from either major party to win a presidential nomination without elected or military experience since 1940, when Republican Wendell Willkie lost to President Franklin Roosevelt.
Mr. Trump's Indiana victory came after he and Mr. Cruz engaged in the most heated rhetoric of the campaign to date.
After Mr. Trump accused Mr. Cruz's father of abetting the Kennedy assassination, Mr. Cruz responded with a stream of epithets, including ""pathological liar,"" ""utterly amoral,"" a ""narcissist,"" and ""serial philanderer.""
Mr. Trump responded on Twitter shortly after voting closed at 7 p.m. EDT: ""Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure -- not very presidential. Sad!""
The extreme remarks came as part of Mr. Cruz's last-ditch effort to stop Mr. Trump in Indiana, a state he declared would determine the fate of his campaign.
Mr. Trump secured his front-runner status on a relatively shoestring budget. His campaign has spent $47 million through the end of March, the latest figures available, of which $35.9 million came in personal loans to the campaign.
Mr. Cruz spent $70 million during the same time frame, and a pro-Cruz super PAC doled out $43.6 million to help his candidacy.
The businessman now faces the challenge of funding a general election battle against Hillary Clinton, who has raised $213 million in contributions through the end of April.
In the 2012 campaign, President Barack Obama spent $721 million and GOP nominee Mitt Romney spent $450 million. Outside groups spent an additional $550 million on the race.
One challenge for Mr. Trump heading into the general election will be either raising hundreds of millions of dollars from the very Republican donors he castigated throughout the primary campaign or dipping into his personal fortune at a scale to which he has been resistant so far. Early in the campaign Mr. Trump resisted calls to spend money on advertising, field staff and political professionals. He still doesn't have a polling expert on his staff.

Election 2016: Front-Runner Strengthens Base in GOP --- Voters drawn more to Trump's working-class appeal than to Cruz's social conservatism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786415721?accountid=12768,"Sen. Ted Cruz built his campaign on an appeal to social conservatives and the party's most ideologically driven voters. While those voters carried Mr. Cruz to victory in nine caucuses and primaries, too many of them, in the end, were drawn to Donald Trump.
In Indiana and many other states, Mr. Cruz couldn't build the conservative coalition he imagined. Evangelical Christians made up 61% of Indiana's Republican voter pool, a higher share than in other Rust Belt primaries. Mr. Trump won more of their votes in Indiana than did Mr. Cruz, exit polls showed.
Similarly, Mr. Trump had out polled Mr. Cruz by more than 7 percentage points among evangelicals in all prior primaries, aggregated exit poll results from those states show.
Some 77% of Indiana's GOP voters described themselves as conservative, a higher share than in several other Rust Belt states. But Mr. Cruz won only the ""very conservative"" voters while losing a larger group -- self-described ""somewhat conservative"" voters -- by 20 percentage points, Indiana exit polls reported by various media showed.
Similarly, Mr. Trump had bested Mr. Cruz among ""somewhat conservative"" voters in combined results from prior contests, winning 43% of their votes, to 22% for Mr. Cruz.
Unable to hold his base, Mr. Cruz was overwhelmed as Mr. Trump posted big margins among voters who weren't part of the Cruz coalition, in particular lower-income Republicans and those who lack a four-year college degree. Many of them identified both as evangelical and working-class, and they were drawn more to Mr. Trump's blue-collar appeal than to Mr. Cruz's social conservatism.
In the primaries before Indiana, Mr. Trump topped Mr. Cruz by 22 percentage points among voters with only a high school education, according to the analysis of prior exit poll results, by Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. Mr. Trump won with a similarly large margin among voters with some college education but no four-year degree.
That pattern held in Indiana, as Mr. Trump carried nearly 59% of voters without a college degree, exit polls reported by various media showed.
On a day that the Republican campaign took a bizarre turn, with Mr. Trump in a TV interview linking Mr. Cruz's father to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, GOP primary voters decreed that it was Mr. Cruz who ran a more unfair campaign. That served as one more sign of Mr. Cruz's weakness in the state.
Some 42% said Mr. Cruz's campaign had been the most unfair, with 38% saying Mr. Trump ran the more unfair campaign, preliminary exit poll results reported by various media showed. The results may have reflected voter unease with a tenuous deal Mr. Cruz struck with another candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, in which Mr. Kasich would tone down his efforts in Indiana in return for Mr. Cruz doing so in several other states.
Mr. Cruz's last significant victory came in the Wisconsin primary in early April. In the subsequent contests, Mr. Trump has enormous advantages across the Republican electorate.
In the six contests before Indiana, Mr. Trump lost only a single county. Big cities, inner suburbs and college towns that had eluded Mr. Trump in early contests began to fall his way in later contests, as they did in Indiana. Mr. Trump looked set to win populous Indianapolis, Gary and South Bend, as well as many of the suburbs around those cities.
In the Democratic race, the votes of white Hoosiers gave Sen. Bernie Sanders an unexpected victory against Hillary Clinton.
Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton had split the votes of white Democrats throughout their long campaign, with each, in the aggregate, drawing about half. On Tuesday those voters tilted heavily toward Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Sanders carried some 57% of white voters, exit polls reported by various media showed. That proved decisive in an election in which white voters accounted for nearly three-quarters of the Democratic voter pool.
Turnout declined sharply in the Democratic primary from the party's last competitive Indiana contest, in 2008, based on preliminary results from Tuesday.
For example, St. Joseph County, home of South Bend, produced about 32,000 votes on Tuesday. In 2008, it had produced more than 63,000.

"Election 2016: Cruz Runs Out of Ammo --- Senator's exit follows an array of late moves, including an alliance and a running mate",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786415463?accountid=12768,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Sen. Ted Cruz on Tuesday departed the Republican presidential contest after having exhausted an array of campaign moves, ending a campaign that started as the longest of long shots but turned into a surprisingly durable effort to tap into the powerful antiestablishment sentiment of the 2016 electorate.
After being crushed in the Indiana primary that he had said would decide the fate of the Republican presidential campaign, Mr. Cruz dropped out, essentially ceding the nomination to front-runner Donald Trump. The move came on the same day the Texas senator had launched a series of verbal attacks at Mr. Trump, calling the now-presumptive nominee ""utterly amoral,"" a ""narcissist,"" a ""serial philanderer"" and a ""pathological liar.""
None of them worked, and Mr. Trump bested both Mr. Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich by double-digits.
""We left it all on the field in Indiana,"" Mr. Cruz said at an election night rally, ""but the voters chose another path.""
Mr. Cruz leaves the race having won four primaries and five caucuses. He also won the majority of delegates from state party conventions in three states, a sign of his team's superior organization.
But in the end, Mr. Cruz couldn't overcome Mr. Trump's nationalist populism. The senator's coalition never grew beyond a core group of dedicated social conservatives, leaving Mr. Trump to pick up support from voters who might have otherwise supported one of the other 14 Republicans who have ended their presidential campaigns.
When he defeated Mr. Trump in the Wisconsin primary April 5, Mr. Cruz declared it a turning point, but Mr. Trump has won all seven primary contests since then.
Mr. Cruz's withdrawal extinguishes the hopes of the stop-Trump faction of the GOP, which has failed to rally behind an effective alternative to the New York businessman. Only Mr. Kasich remains in the race, and he has trailed far behind Mr. Trump.
Many Republicans were surprised Mr. Cruz was the one in the large GOP field to wind up being Mr. Trump's most formidable opponent. When he announced his candidacy a little more than a year ago, Mr. Cruz, 45 years old, was seen as a long-shot, a tea-party hero unpopular with his Senate colleagues who seemed to emerge from the conservative fringes.
But over the ensuing months, he amassed one of the largest campaign war chests. He built a formidable national campaign organization, and his anti-Washington, antiestablishment message played well. He systematically expanded his reach into the evangelical community, an investment that paid off in Iowa, where he won the caucuses.
But Mr. Trump found ways to make deep inroads among evangelical voters, and Mr. Cruz proved unable to beat the New Yorker at the anti-Washington game.
The strength of the Cruz campaign was a monument to how much the Republican Party has changed in the four years since he first came onto the national political scene. The tea-party movement that propelled him into the Senate has unleashed an anti-Washington political force that came back to bite him. Grass-roots disappointment with the GOP establishment also created a powerful undertow in 2016 that made Mr. Trump's rise possible.
Mr. Cruz, like much of the rest of the party, underestimated the staying power of Mr. Trump's campaign. Assuming Mr. Trump would eventually implode, the senator tried to position himself to inherit his followers.
For months, Mr. Cruz not only didn't attack Mr. Trump, he praised him. He only gently distanced himself from Mr. Trump's most provocative ideas such as a ban on allowing Muslims to the U.S.
Once Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz started attacking each other, it became bitter and vicious. In the past week or so, Mr. Cruz tried a number of last-minute moves, from an unprecedented alliance with Mr. Kasich to naming his vice presidential running mate, Carly Fiorina.
Although Mr. Cruz said nothing about supporting Mr. Trump in his concession speech, Mr. Trump on Tuesday was conciliatory.
""What Ted did is a very brave thing to do,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We want to bring unity to the Republican Party.""

Election 2016: Cruz Confident of Beating Trump in Wisconsin Vote,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778346820?accountid=12768,"KENOSHA, Wis. -- As Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump finished campaign sprints across Wisconsin on Monday, the Texan appeared on the verge of his first primary victory in more than a month over the Republican presidential front-runner.
In a jovial mood during a campaign appearance at the Mars Cheese Castle here on Monday, Mr. Cruz all but predicted a Tuesday victory in between sampling cheese curds, jalapeno cheese bread and cheese popcorn.
""The people of Wisconsin, they are looking at the records of the candidates, and they realize that Donald screams and yells a lot, but he has no solutions,"" Mr. Cruz said.
In La Crosse, Wis., on Monday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the state could deal him only his second primary-state loss since March 1. ""It may not happen, because we have the machine against us,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to the state's entire Republican apparatus.
Mr. Cruz's stop at the iconic 25,000-square-foot cheese emporium came as he focused the final days of his Wisconsin campaign on the vote-rich southeastern corner of the state, where GOP statewide elections usually are decided. He also filmed a Fox News town hall in Madison, stopped at an Italian market in Milwaukee and planned a large evening rally in Waukesha, home to the state's largest concentration of Republican voters.
Mr. Cruz holds double-digit leads in statewide polling, though Mr. Trump is strong in the state's rural western and northern congressional districts, home to the rural, economically strained voters who have been strong constituencies for him elsewhere.
On Tuesday, Wisconsin will award 42 delegates to the Republican National Convention, with 24 divided between the state's eight congressional districts and 14 going to the statewide winner.
Mr. Trump focused his attention on the state's distant corners, in La Crosse in the southwest along the Minnesota border, and the far north on the shores of Lake Superior.
In Superior, Mr. Trump derided the ""never Trump"" movement seeking to stop him with a barrage of negative advertising. ""If they worked this hard to stop Obama, Obama wouldn't have had a chance,"" the billionaire said.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is competitive in only one of the state's eight congressional districts and lags far behind in polls, campaigned Monday in New York, instead of making a final Wisconsin push.
One challenge for Mr. Cruz, who hasn't won a primary state since Texas and Oklahoma on March 1, is finding how he could repeat a Wisconsin victory in other states that don't produce the kinds of headwinds that have slowed Mr. Trump in the last two weeks here.
Mr. Trump has only lost three primary states so far: Texas and Oklahoma, where Mr. Cruz was essentially playing on home turf, and Ohio, where Mr. Kasich mobilized his home-state Republican machine to boost him to victory.
Still, Mr. Cruz, who trailed Mr. Trump in Wisconsin polling conducted weeks ago, before the GOP field winnowed to three candidates, stressed the comeback nature of his candidacy here.
""Just a couple of weeks ago, all of the media commentators were saying Wisconsin is a state where I could not compete,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""They were saying it is a natural state for Donald Trump.""
Campaigning with Mr. Cruz at the cheese shop, onetime rival candidate Scott Walker, Wisconsin's governor, predicted the state would serve as a bellwether for states still to hold nominating contests. ""You could start to see a shift of momentum, of people starting to open up the door to see who Ted is,"" he said.
But for Mr. Cruz, the political mechanics in Wisconsin are more like Ohio than the next states on the calendar: the Northeastern states of New York on April 19, then Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island a week later. Those states have fewer conservatives and more moderate Republicans.

"Election 2016: Each Front-Runner Hits a Hurdle --- Exit polls show GOP groups swung to Cruz, while Sanders drew on his liberal base",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778674939?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin dealt a setback to the presidential campaign's front-runners, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but for different reasons in each party.
Democratic voting patterns mirrored those of many prior contests, with Mrs. Clinton building large margins among African-Americans and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders carrying younger voters, independents and liberals. In a state heavy on liberals and light on minority voters, the voting pool included far more of Mr. Sanders's base voters than traditional Clinton supporters.
The Republican story was different: Voting groups that had given only tepid support to Sen. Ted Cruz swung more squarely behind him in Wisconsin, enabling him to overcome Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump, for example, had built big margins in prior contests among lower-income voters and those without college degrees. In Wisconsin, Mr. Cruz narrowly won those groups or tied his top rival, according to surveys of voters as they left their polling places.
Mr. Trump had carried self-described conservative voters in Michigan, another big Midwestern state, which he won last month. But in Wisconsin, those voters backed Mr. Cruz, exit polls reported by CNN and other media showed.
The Wisconsin exit polls suggested that Mr. Trump may have a growing problem with women. He won only 36% of their vote on Tuesday, while Mr. Cruz captured 48%.
Mr. Trump's support among women was actually a slight improvement over the results from two other Midwestern states, Michigan and Ohio. But as the GOP field winnows, a 36% share of women would signal a weakness in his support.
Republican voters were asked to weigh in on one of the overriding questions of the GOP primary race: What should happen if no candidate wins a majority of delegates before the party's national convention?
Under party rules, the only way to clinch the presidential nomination is to win support from more than half of the 2,472 convention delegates. But more than half of Republican voters in Wisconsin -- some 56% -- said that if no one meets that standard, then the candidate with the most primary votes should claim the nomination, according to exit polls reported by various media.
By contrast, some 42% of Wisconsin Republicans endorsed the party's regular procedures and said the convention delegates should pick whomever they think would be the best nominee.
Not surprisingly, supporters of Mr. Trump favored the scenario that would best suit their candidate, as did Mr. Cruz's backers. Mr. Trump's supporters were most likely to say that the candidate with the most primary votes should become the nominee, while Mr. Cruz's supporters were more likely to say that a contested convention should be decided by the delegates.
In the Democratic race, each candidate drew on familiar voting blocs. Mr. Sanders retained his hold on young voters, carrying 81% of those ages 18 to 29, according to exit polls reported by CNN and other media.
Mr. Sanders won 71% of independents who cast ballots in the primary while tying Mrs. Clinton among Democratic Party members. He carried 60% of voters who rated themselves ""very liberal.""
The party's youngest and most liberal voters, as well as independents, have been pillars of Mr. Sanders's support in prior contests.
Mrs. Clinton retained her hold on nonwhite voters, particularly African-Americans.
Those familiar voting patterns left Mrs. Clinton at a disadvantage. She won 74% of black voters, but they accounted for less than a tenth of the electorate -- half the share that African-Americans accounted for in Ohio, the Midwestern state that Mrs. Clinton won last month.
Some 84% of voters in Wisconsin's Democratic primary were white, exit polls showed, compared with 74% in Ohio.
Some 66% of Wisconsin voters described themselves as liberal, a dramatically larger share than in 2008, during the last competitive Democratic primary. That year, only 47% rated themselves liberal. The share of Democratic voters calling themselves moderate or conservative fell from 53% to 32% over eight years. Those changes in the party helped Mr. Sanders.

"Cruz, Sanders Get Big Wins",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778674932?accountid=12768,"MILWAUKEE -- Both parties' presidential front-runners lost primaries in Wisconsin Tuesday as GOP Sen. Ted Cruz beat Donald Trump and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders bested Hillary Clinton, virtually assuring heated battles all the way to the final primaries in June.
The results increase the odds that Republicans will have a contested party convention in July and force Mrs. Clinton to fight longer than anyone expected to clinch her party's nomination.
""Tonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry,"" Mr. Cruz told supporters in Milwaukee after he finished ahead of Mr. Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. ""We have a choice, a real choice.""
The GOP result was a hard-won victory for anti-Trump forces who had seen the Wisconsin primary as their last, best hope to slow the front-runner's momentum toward the Republican nomination.
Mr. Trump's campaign issued a defiant statement, saying Mr. Cruz was a tool of an establishment dead set against him. ""Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet,"" the statement said. ""He is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump.""
The Texas senator's victory followed one of the rockiest weeks of Mr. Trump's campaign. Trailing in the polls and under concerted attack from Republican leaders in the state, Mr. Trump also weathered a series of controversies over abortion and other issues that threatened to undercut his standing with women voters.
Wisconsin will award its 18 at-large delegates to Mr. Cruz as the statewide winner. He's likely to also win a vast majority of the 24 delegates divided among the state's eight congressional districts, though district-by-district results weren't yet available.
Mr. Cruz's strong showing will make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to wrap up the 1,237 delegates needed for the GOP nomination before the primary season ends on June 7, when California allocates the largest number of delegates.
Next up on the GOP calendar is the April 19 primary in New York, Mr. Trump's home state, where polls show him with a commanding lead of more than 30 percentage points over Mr. Cruz, who in some surveys runs behind Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
New York awards 95 delegates, most of which are allotted proportionately by congressional district. Mr. Trump plans to campaign on Long Island on Wednesday.
""Trump has more support than anyone else in New York and always had,"" said state assemblyman Bill Nojay of Pittsford, in north-central New York. ""If the vote was held today, we expect he would win every single congressional district.""
A week later, a swath of other East Coast states vote -- Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Mr. Cruz's best hope is in states further ahead in the calendar -- Indiana on May 3 and Nebraska on May 10.
Wisconsin -- with its GOP electorate dominated by the kind of working-class, white voters who have been drawn to Mr. Trump elsewhere -- was long seen as fertile ground for the New York businessman. But it turned into a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment.
""We have to stop Trump,"" said Mary Czarra, 65 years old, of Menomonee Falls, who voted for Mr. Cruz even though she preferred Mr. Kasich. ""He insulted our governor, for crying out loud. You can't do that if you're a Republican here.""
Mr. Cruz was endorsed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, still a hero to the state's conservatives even though his 2016 presidential campaign fizzled.
Mr. Trump lambasted Mr. Walker and others in the state party establishment who opposed him, and their assault on the front-runner backfired among voters like Jim White, 62, of Milwaukee.
""I see the GOP fighting this guy all the way, and I don't like it,"" Mr. White said. ""My feeling is this is about to destroy a lot of people; they won't vote ever again if Trump loses.""
Holding out hope for a come-from-behind victory, Mr. Trump spent the past week stumping across the state, even skipping his grandson's bris Sunday to greet voters at a Milwaukee diner.
""He cannot downplay the significance of Wisconsin, because he moved here for the final week,"" said Brian Fraley, a Republican operative based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. ""He went to every corner of the state. He was everywhere and he worked it hard, so he can't say that little Wisconsin didn't mean much. If it didn't mean much, he wouldn't be investing time and energy here.""
Wisconsin's primary had been seen as a tough test for Mr. Cruz because he has struggled in other Midwestern industrial states including Michigan and Illinois. Most of his victories over Mr. Trump have come in states that hold caucuses -- time-consuming events that play to his grass-roots organizational strength. Wisconsin's primary also is open to Democrats and independents, not just registered Republicans.
Mr. Trump has done better in open primaries, while Mr. Cruz improves where balloting is limited to the party faithful. But with an equally competitive Democratic race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders for their party's nomination, it was unclear if Mr. Trump could pull away cross-party voters.
Before Tuesday, Mr. Trump had 737 delegates, Mr. Cruz had 475. Even if Mr. Cruz ended up winning all 42 delegates from Wisconsin, it was unlikely there are enough bound delegates left for him to reach 1,237 before the convention.
For Mr. Trump, locking up the nomination during the primary season is possible but increasingly difficult, raising the chances that Republicans will choose their nominee in Cleveland, in a contested convention.
Messrs. Cruz and Trump have played down suggestions that another candidate would be nominated if the convention deadlocked, and warned that grass-roots Republicans would rebel if that happened.
Mark Meckler, a tea-party activist who hasn't endorsed any candidate, agreed. ""As for the chatter about a contested convention, if neither Cruz nor Trump are the nominee, the Republican Party will end in a fiery crash and Hillary Clinton will be our next president,"" he said. ""Many in the grass-roots movement say they will simply not vote.""
The next several primaries are in East Coast states where Republicans are likely to be less receptive to Mr. Cruz's religious, antiestablishment brand of conservatism than they are in Wisconsin.
""This is the last state in which Ted Cruz has any ability to win a state through the rest of April, and in some of them, he's going to be fighting for second place,"" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Trump adviser and daughter of former presidential rival Mike Huckabee.
In the run-up to Wisconsin, a series of controversies damaged his already-shaky standing among women. He admitted it was a mistake to have retweeted an unflattering photo of Mr. Cruz's wife Heidi. And he offered contradictory responses to questions about the sensitive abortion rights issue.
He seemed to be trying to lessen the damage by bringing his wife, Melania, onto the campaign trail on the eve of the Wisconsin primary.
Yet his mistakes helped Mr. Cruz pick up the endorsement of the National Right to Life Committee, the leading national antiabortion rights group.
After a vote Saturday by its board of directors, the group said: ""Sen. Cruz is the only candidate for president who has always been pro-life, who has a 100% pro-life voting record with National Right to Life, who can win the Republican nomination, and who can defeat pro-abortion Hillary Clinton in November.""
In an MSNBC interview Tuesday, Mr. Trump denied the week has reflected badly on his support for women. ""As far as women are concerned, nobody respects women more than I do, not even close,"" he said.

Election 2016: Delegate-Selection Race Plays to Cruz's Strength,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779827974?accountid=12768,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- Ted Cruz shut out his Republican presidential rivals in the Colorado delegation-selection contest this weekend, and he is intensifying pressure on front-runner Donald Trump to step up his game in similar state and local conventions that are taking on heightened significance in the campaign's next phase.
The party conventions across the country typically get little nation attention. But while Mr. Trump has recently reorganized and beefed up his campaign staff to focus on them, the scramble is an insider's contest that plays to one of Mr. Cruz's strengths: his ties with seasoned political activists. They turned out in force in Colorado, where he dominated the state's raucous and chaotic convention system and picked up all 34 delegates available.
They also delivered in Iowa, where Republicans on Saturday -- more than two months after the state held its caucus for voters -- began the process of picking delegates to the July national convention. Cruz supporters won 11 of the 12 that were up for grabs in Iowa.
That continues a winning streak for the Texas senator, who won the Utah caucuses three weeks ago. Last weekend in North Dakota, more supporters of Mr. Cruz than Mr. Trump won delegate slots. And Mr. Cruz triumphed in Wisconsin's primary last Tuesday.
""Y'all have been part of something incredible that has happened in the last three weeks,"" he told a crowd of more than 6,000 Colorado Republicans at an ice-hockey arena here.
Mr. Trump still enjoys a wide lead in delegates, and the primary campaign is heading into a tough stretch for Mr. Cruz, in New York and other Eastern states that are more favorable political terrain for the billionaire businessman and the third candidate remaining in the race, Ohio Gov. John Kasich. But Mr. Cruz is betting his supporters will hold more sway in convention delegations, even in states where Mr. Trump won the popular vote.
For example, delegate selection in Georgia, where Mr. Trump won the primary by a wide margin, begins next weekend, and the Cruz campaign has been working to stack the state delegation with its supporters. That way, even if the delegates are bound to support Mr. Trump on the first ballot in Cleveland, they will then be free to support any candidate if no one gets the 1,237-delegate majority on the first round of voting.
This past weekend, in addition to Republicans in Colorado and Iowa, state parties in Michigan, Indiana, and Virginia held delegate-selection events. Next Saturday, Wyoming holds its state convention, where Mr. Cruz will speak and has already been running strong in county contests.
Speaking Sunday on NBC, Mr. Trump's new convention manager, Paul Manafort, complained that the Cruz campaign was using strong-arm tactics to get delegates in line.
""You go to these county conventions and you see the Gestapo tactics -- the scorched-earth tactics,"" Mr. Manafort said. ""We are going to be filing several protests because, the reality is, they are not playing by the rules.""
Mr. Trump, speaking Sunday in Rochester, N.Y., added, ""This is a crooked system, folks.""
Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the campaign is ""working hard to build a superior organization and are working within the process and rules that have been established.""
Mr. Trump is playing catch-up, some of his supporters fear, because so many of them are political outsiders and novices who have never participated before. The campaign is now trying to give higher priority to the delegate-selection process and more power to convention veterans like Mr. Manafort.
At the Michigan GOP meeting on Saturday, the new Trump savvy may have paid off: The Cruz team got boxed out of the state's seats on key convention committees.
Still, some supporters worry that if Mr. Trump falls short of the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination, his supporters may wish he had done more in places like Colorado.
""If Donald Trump is 34 delegates short,"" said Trump volunteer Gabriel Schwartz, a Denver lawyer, Colorado might have made a difference.

The Cruz Conundrum,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779827415?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin Republicans made their primary a referendum on Donald Trump, which he lost. Now the beneficiary of this anti-Trump surge, Ted Cruz, must reassemble the same coalition in the remaining states, persuade a reluctant GOP to rally behind him, and then expand his general-election appeal. Other than that, the White House is his.
In other words, Mr. Cruz's chance to become President hinges on the so-called Republican establishment that he calls ""the Washington cartel."" He wants the same people whose enmity he otherwise welcomes to ordain him as the only non-Trump alternative. Then he'll roll into Cleveland with a smaller plurality of delegates than the businessman but depend on the power brokers of a brokered convention to pry away the nomination.
---
The early polls in New York and other eastern states suggest this won't be as easy as Mr. Cruz claims. He says Wisconsin shows the Republican Party is coming together ""as one"" behind him, but in New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland he's trailing Mr. Trump and Ohio Governor John Kasich.
One reason Mr. Cruz hasn't rallied more Republicans, despite the fear of Mr. Trump, is that the Texan built his presidential strategy on assailing Republicans. He's the political leader of the conservative subculture that has emerged during the Obama Presidency that attributes the country's problems -- from slow growth to stagnant wages to abusive government -- to a GOP ""surrender caucus"" that supposedly sold out or didn't fight hard enough.
Mr. Cruz often explains that the great political divide isn't between Republicans and Democrats but between ""we the people"" and a bipartisan tong of career politicians and corrupt corporate interests. If grass-roots activists are disappointed in the Washington status quo, and they have every reason to be, Mr. Cruz has encouraged them to blame any conservative leader not named Ted Cruz.
The problem with this narrative is that it's largely synthetic. Note that Mr. Trump is now calling Mr. Cruz a ""Trojan horse"" of the establishment, which shows how elastic the membership criteria are.
Whatever their mistakes, Republican leaders have built the largest majority in Congress and the states since the 1920s. They've developed the most ambitious reform agenda in decades -- on taxes, entitlements and even poverty. Anyone who claims there's no difference between Paul Ryan and Tom DeLay, or for that matter President Obama, is obtuse or dishonest. If Republicans had stayed focused on the Obama record and Hillary Clinton, they'd now be uniting with a great chance to retake the White House and reform the federal government.
---
Instead the Cruz counter-establishment stoked popular hostility against fellow Republicans. They haven't offered much new policy, except for hostility to immigration and trade. Their focus has been to denounce compromise as betrayal and invent pretexts for anger as a way to mobilize fund-raising and launch Mr. Cruz's primary campaign.
Across the 2011 debt ceiling showdown, the 2013 ObamaCare shutdown that Mr. Cruz engineered, and the various budget deals, anyone who recognized the limits of political possibility with a liberal President was smeared as lacking philosophical conviction. When these gambits inevitably failed, he blamed the establishment for that too.
This rage-against-the-machine bill of goods catapulted Mr. Cruz to prominence on talk radio, digital media and within a rump wing of the Republican Party. But the same fury also paved the way for Mr. Trump, who exploited it with a more blunt-spoken populism on immigration, trade and foreign policy.
Outflanked by Mr. Trump, the Texas Senator let himself be dragged further toward positions that alienate much of the GOP and American mainstream. On immigration he criticized Mr. Trump not for mass deportation but because Mr. Trump suggested he might let some of the deported re-enter legally. On trade Mr. Cruz joined Mr. Ryan in an op-ed in these pages praising trade-promotion authority, only to renounce his support after Mr. Trump opposed it. The difference is that Mr. Cruz knows better, giving himself a chameleon, untrustworthy cast.
To put it another way, to many Republicans the best argument Mr. Trump has is that Mr. Cruz is the main alternative -- and vice versa. The Senator has a better policy grounding than Mr. Trump, and his nomination wouldn't set off a third-party challenge. But he has backed himself into a political box canyon that will be hard to escape.
---
It's not impossible for Mr. Cruz to win in November, given Hillary Clinton's weaknesses. But there's a reason polls have him losing to her and Bernie Sanders. His negatives aren't as high as Mr. Trump's, but in most polls they are higher than Hillary's.
Mr. Cruz's theory of recent presidential politics is that John McCain and Mitt Romney were ""moderates"" who demoralized the Republican base. Thus his strategy is to polarize and mobilize conservatives who didn't show up in 2008 and 2012, and for months he's told independents, moderates and swing voters he doesn't need their support.
Mr. Cruz is right that the GOP base needs to be energized, but he's probably wrong to think that turning out conservatives alone, and especially non-Hispanic whites, are sufficient in a demographically and politically evolving nation. Conservatives are not a majority, and they need to make coalitions behind an optimistic and inclusive center-right vision.
Which states that Mr. Romney lost would Mr. Cruz flip in the Electoral College? Wisconsin? In the Badger State exit polls, three of 10 Republicans said they'd vote for Mrs. Clinton, a third party or no one in a Cruz-Clinton race. That's only a bit better than the 37% who said the same about a Trump-Clinton match-up. The point is that Mr. Cruz has to show he's more than a faction leader if he wants to be the nominee, much less win in November.
The Texan recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel's TV program, and the host told him, ""What you did is, you kind of held out until they found someone that they liked less than you."" Mr. Cruz replied, ""Listen, it is a powerful strategy."" The audience laughed, but the problem is that it isn't a joke.

"Election 2016: In Wyoming, Cruz Is Set to Notch More Delegates",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781292825?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has been trying to step up his game when it comes to corralling delegates for the Republican National Convention, but his efforts are likely too late to avoid another defeat Saturday, in Wyoming.
Sen. Ted Cruz is favored to win, as Wyoming's GOP will finish picking its 29 convention delegates just a week after the Texas senator swept a similar event in Colorado to pick up 34 delegates.
Mr. Trump and his backers have been crying foul about the results in Colorado and in other state party conventions where he argues that the GOP rules are ""rigged"" to keep him from getting as many convention delegates as he deserves.
Party officials have pushed back against Mr. Trump's suggestion that the selection process in Colorado and elsewhere was stacked against him, arguing that the delegate rules have been in place for more than a year.
Speaking about the nominating process Friday on Fox News Channel, Mr. Cruz said: ""If anyone is running an effective and competent presidential campaign, they ought to be able to figure out how to go and win an election.""
Wyoming is one of a handful of states that, like Colorado, do not hold a statewide primary or caucus to decide how to allocate delegates. Instead, it holds county and state conventions to determine both how many delegate slots go to each candidate and who those delegates will be.
Thomas Sansonetti, former Wyoming GOP chairman, said the convention system has been used in large part to avoid the higher cost of a statewide election. What is more, he said, caucuses and conventions encourage and reward people who work hard for the party.
But because the system requires a big time commitment, critics say, it limits the scope of GOP voters who can participate in the process.
Former Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson says he doesn't like the system and believes it is designed to screen out candidates who aren't in the mainstream. Mr. Simpson wouldn't say whom he supports for president.
Saturday in Casper, Republicans will finish assembling Wyoming's 29-member delegation. Twelve delegates were chosen in county GOP conventions in March. Of the 12, nine are pledged to Mr. Cruz, one to Mr. Trump and one to Sen. Marco Rubio, who has dropped out. The remaining delegate isn't tethered to a candidate.

"In Hunt for Delegates, Cruz Campaigns in Unlikely Places",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780441414?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz went to a Dominican-Chinese eatery in the Bronx last week and met with black and Spanish pastors. The next day, the Republican presidential hopeful visited a matzo-baking center in Brooklyn to talk with Jewish voters.
Republicans in New York don't often campaign in such Democratic strongholds. They head for Staten Island and the state's western stretches. But Mr. Cruz, who is trailing his rivals in state polls, has focused on Democratic congressional districts, where his team hopes to pick up at least some of the state's 95 delegates in the April 19 primary.
""There are orphan districts in New York we feel like we can target that have few Republican voters, and we can get more people to turn out and vote,"" said Catherine Frazier, a Cruz spokeswoman. ""You can expect our time in the state is going to be targeting specific coalitions.""
The Cruz campaign's micro-targeting is the latest iteration of its strategy of winning enough delegates, sometimes in unlikely places, to block Donald Trump's ability to secure the 1,237 needed to clinch the nomination before the July convention. If there is a contested convention, another candidate, such as Mr. Cruz, could wind up the party's standard bearer.
On Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that he doesn't want to be considered, and that the nominee should be someone who ran in the primary campaign.
Of New York's 95 delegates, 14 are awarded based on statewide primary results. The rest are allocated based on primary results in each of the 27 congressional districts. If a candidate wins less than 50% of the vote in a district, the second-place finisher gets one of the district's three delegates.
Mr. Trump has 743 delegates while Mr. Cruz has 545. Mr. Trump has often complained about losing delegates in states where he won the popular vote, and he recently hired a campaign operative, Paul Manafort, to revamp his strategy. His campaign didn't respond to requests for comment.
His grousing intensified in the wake of Saturday's Colorado GOP convention, which met in lieu of a primary and awarded all of the state's available delegates to Cruz supporters. Mr. Trump argued the system disenfranchised millions of Colorado Republicans who had no primary to vote in.
""That system is set up so the crooked politicians can make sure they get somebody in who's not part of what we're doing,"" Mr. Trump said Tuesday in Rome, N.Y.
Mr. Cruz, speaking to conservative radio host and supporter Glenn Beck Tuesday, said of Mr. Trump's attacks, ""Donald is a very sore loser. He doesn't handle losing well.""
Party officials have defended their processes against Mr. Trump's onslaught. ""The rules were set last year,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Monday on Twitter. ""Nothing mysterious -- nothing new. The rules have not changed.""
Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner also pushed back against Mr. Trump, faulting him for not putting adequate effort into the state. ""Elections are won by those who show up,"" said Mr. Gardner on CNN Tuesday. ""It is not a coronation.""
Mr. Cruz's best moments have come in caucuses, local conventions and small state primaries -- very different environments from New York. The latest WSJ-NBC poll of likely New York Republican primary voters released Monday showed Mr. Trump at 54%, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 21% and Mr. Cruz at 18%.
Ms. Frazier said the Cruz campaign is focusing its canvassing, calling and social-media efforts in certain areas, but declined to say how the campaign specifically picked them. The Bronx is about 6% Republican, while Brooklyn is about 9%, according to a 2012 state report of registered voters. Mr. Cruz also held an event in Manhattan, where about 10% of the borough is Republican.
""This is all about the delegates,"" said J.C. Polanco, a Bronx political operative and former Board of Elections president who has worked with Mr. Cruz's campaign. ""They are light years beyond everything we've seen here.""
Beyond its size and diversity, Mr. Cruz has other problems in New York. He damaged himself when he criticized Mr. Trump by saying he had ""New York values,"" a remark that angered Republicans and Democrats alike.
""I don't think there is a whole lot Cruz can do to turn himself around in New York,"" said Charles Joyce, one of the state's two GOP national committee members. Mr. Joyce said he hadn't heard from the Cruz campaign, and that his message wouldn't be well received in much of the state.
In addition, targeting Republicans in the Bronx can be difficult, ""because there are so few of us,"" Mr. Polanco said. He said the campaign had largely focused on using social media to communicate with supporters.
When he arrived at a Bronx event, Mr. Cruz was heckled over his position on climate change and immigration.
Mr. Cruz met with about 50 ministers, a gathering arranged by Rev. Ruben Diaz, a controversial Democratic state senator with a large political network. That lunch also was interrupted by loud protesters, and some of the pastors said they weren't committed to Mr. Cruz.
Mr. Cruz's campaign said he visited last week the Chabad Neshama Center in Brighton Beach, a heavily Jewish Brooklyn neighborhood, to speak to Hasidic and Orthodox Jews, a powerful voting bloc, about his pro-Israel stances.
When Mr. Cruz held a rally last week in Scotia, a small town near Albany, it was designed to target three different congressional districts filled with many government insiders and employees, said Mike Cuevas, the GOP chairman there who has worked with the Cruz campaign.
The campaign staged an event in Brooklyn last week with black business leaders, because it believed Mr. Cruz's economic message of lower taxes and fewer government regulations would resonate, and charter-school leaders were also invited. The campaign stops have sometimes startled neighborhoods, such as the one in the Bronx, where people gawked at Mr. Cruz from outside Spanish bodegas selling coconuts.
""Maybe it's 10% Republican,"" said Rafael Flores, a 44-year-old Cruz supporter from Long Island, sitting in the Dominican-Chinese restaurant. ""It's a very good question: Why is he here?""

Cruz Makes His Last Stand,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785964339?accountid=12768,"Sen. Ted Cruz, in a last-ditch effort to derail Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, is trying to marshal support from governors, former rivals and other anti-Trump Republicans in advance of the make-or-break primary in Indiana Tuesday.
With polls showing him lagging behind the New York businessman in the Hoosier state, the Texas senator talked up the somewhat equivocal support he received from Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Friday.
Mr. Pence said on an Indianapolis talk-radio show that he would vote for Mr. Cruz because he is ""a principled conservative who has dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda."" But then, Mr. Pence added, ""I particularly want to commend Donald Trump, who I think has given voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans.""
Earlier this week, Mr. Cruz tried to coordinate strategy with his other remaining GOP presidential rival, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and took the extraordinary step of naming Carly Fiorina as his running mate a day after he lost to Mr. Trump by a landslide in primaries in five Northeastern states on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Mr. Cruz's onetime rival, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, this week repeated his call for Republicans to vote for Mr. Cruz.
To some Republicans, it was a week that amounted to a series of Hail Mary passes by a candidate running out of time. ""Cruz is so desperate that he is throwing everything -- including the kitchen sink and the Indiana Old Oaken Bucket -- at Trump,"" said Rick Hohlt, a GOP fundraiser who is moving toward supporting Mr. Trump, referring to a college football trophy.
Mr. Cruz acknowledges that his presidential prospects will all but collapse if Mr. Trump sweeps Indiana. While the front-runner can't secure the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination until the last day of primary balloting on June 7, it is hard to see how he can be stopped if anti-Trump forces don't prevail in Indiana.
""Make no mistake, Indiana is absolutely pivotal,"" Mr. Cruz said in a fundraising email. ""If Trump wins all the delegates in Indiana, his nomination could be all but determined.""
A big obstacle to stopping Mr. Trump, however, is that many Republicans are loath to throw their weight behind Mr. Cruz, who has earned GOP wrath by trashing the party leadership in Congress.
Anti-Cruz sentiment came to the fore this week when former House Speaker John Boehner called him ""Lucifer in the flesh.""
In an interview on Thursday with WMUR in Boston, former New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg -- first a Bush supporter and now a Kasich backer -- said he would never support Mr. Cruz.
""He's a demagogue's demagogue, and he shouldn't be trusted with the responsibilities of the office,"" Mr. Gregg said.
While the Cruz campaign declined to respond to Mr. Gregg's criticism, Mr. Cruz and his supporters have treated the Boehner attack as a badge of honor.
David McIntosh, head of Club for Growth Action, a political group backing Mr. Cruz, took a swipe at Mr. Boehner on Friday while unveiling a new ad for Mr. Cruz in Indiana. ""Ted Cruz has a strong and consistent record of fighting to repeal Obamacare,"" said Mr. McIntosh, a former Indiana House member. ""That's why guys like John Boehner don't like Ted.""
Recent polls in Indiana show Mr. Trump in the lead, but not by such large margins as he held in the Northeastern states that voted Tuesday. A Real Clear Politics average of polls put Mr. Trump in the lead with 38.8%, followed by Mr. Cruz with 33.5% and Mr. Kasich with 18.5%.
Mr. Pence's decision to weigh in on the GOP primary was something of a surprise, because the governor faces his own tough re-election race in the fall. He met with all three of the presidential candidates last week, but many Republicans expected he would stay on the sidelines rather than risk alienating voters he will need for his own re-election.
Mike Murphy, former chairman of the Indianapolis GOP and an uncommitted convention delegate, said that Mr. Pence's support may have been too tepid to have much impact on voters at a time when Mr. Cruz badly needs to change minds.
""Was that an endorsement? I think it reinforces the opinions of people who are already for Cruz,"" said Mr. Murphy. ""I think Cruz has a chance, but not the probability of winning. He's going to have to reach an awful lot of Hoosiers and change a lot of minds. . . . It's looking more and more like Trump is the nominee.""
Kellyanne Conway, head of a pro-Cruz super PAC and a polling adviser to Mr. Pence, said his support for Mr. Cruz would have tremendous impact and, given his own political exposure, was an act of political courage.
""Mike Pence's endorsement was the most coveted get in all of Indiana,"" she said. ""All three lobbied hard to secure it.""
Mr. Pence has been at the center of controversy on an issue -- religious liberty -- that is important to Mr. Cruz and the evangelical conservatives who are part of his political base. Last year, Mr. Pence signed legislation that supporters say protects the rights of people who are opposed to gay marriage on religious grounds -- a measure that critics say would allow discrimination against gays.
The governor had come under pressure from Cruz supporters, anti-Trump activists and other conservatives to weigh in sooner in the campaign on Cruz's behalf.
Patty Jones, 49 years old, a Cruz supporter from Argos, Ind., was disappointed that Mr. Pence's endorsement wasn't stronger, and that he didn't speak out even earlier, and warned that a Trump-led ticket could hurt other Republicans running for office in the fall.
""If Trump's on the ticket, it's going to take down a lot of people,"" she said.

"Election 2016: Clinton, Cruz Rake In Campaign Donations",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782388903?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Ted Cruz and their allies have millions of dollars on hand and are in the strongest financial positions in their respective parties as they head into the primary season's final stretch, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, donations to the super PAC backing Gov. John Kasich sagged and his campaign saw just a small fundraising bump following his win last month in his home state of Ohio.
A super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA Action, raised $11.7 million last month -- more than double its February haul -- and had $44.6 million left to spend at the end of March, according to its FEC filing.
The PAC's haul will supplement strong fundraising by Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which ended March with $29 million in the bank. Mrs. Clinton had been outraised in March by rival Bernie Sanders -- bringing in $29.3 million to the Vermont senator's $46 million -- but spent her funds at a slower rate. Mr. Sanders churned through his cash in March, and ended the month with $17 million in the bank.
Campaigns and super PACs were required to disclose their March fundraising to the FEC by midnight on Wednesday.
Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, had $8.8 million in the bank at the end of March. He raised $12.5 million during the month.
GOP front-runner Donald Trump loaned his campaign another $11.5 million last month -- bringing his total loans to more than $36 million -- and raised another $2.7 million from outside donors. While his cash-on-hand figure, at $2.1 million, was barely higher than Mr. Kasich's, Mr. Trump has said he is willing to spend uncapped amounts on the campaign.
Mr. Cruz is also backed by a growing network of super PACs that raised at least $10 million last month and had more than $21 million left to spend. The super PAC backing Mr. Trump, which launched a $1 million ad campaign on his behalf last month, had not yet filed with the FEC.
Super PACs can raise money without contribution caps but are barred from coordinating with or donating to campaigns.
Trusted Leadership PAC, a super PAC in the network of pro-Cruz groups, saidWednesdaythat it raised $4.5 million in March. Trusted Leadership PAC's biggest donors last month were Stan Herzog, chief executive of Missouri-based Herzog Contracting Corp., and Richard Uihlein, owner of a Wisconsin-based shipping company. Each gave $1 million.

The Weekend Interview with Ted Cruz: Ted Cruz's Establishment Turn,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783656170?accountid=12768,"New York -- Thank -- or blame -- Phil Gramm for Ted Cruz. The retired Texas senator's opposition to Hillary Clinton's health-care plan in the early 1990s inspired his political career, says the man with the second-best odds of running against Mr. Gramm's old nemesis this fall.
""Republicans' initial response to HillaryCare was to come up with a watered-down version, partially socialized medicine,"" Mr. Cruz says, during a visit to the Journal this week. A law student at the time, ""I was yelling at the television set basically saying the heck with you, I'm just gonna go live on an island and fish, because nobody believes nothing.""
Then Mr. Gramm emerged to declare that the bill ""will pass over my cold, dead political body."" It was his labors against ""what everyone said was inevitable, that both infused spinal fortitude in other members of the Senate but also began impacting the public debate,"" Mr. Cruz says. ""Victory ultimately depended on convincing the American people. That's the only way to win the biggest and most important political battles: You've got to make the case to the people.""
The performance is echt-Cruz -- a historical parable that carries a moral lesson for the present; that stresses the abiding fecklessness of Republican elites and the importance of raging against the machine; and that ends with a canticle to ""We the People."" It is also somewhat awkward, given that Mr. Gramm is sitting at Mr. Cruz's elbow as he tells the tale.
But the younger Texan's fortunes do now belong to the people -- 2,472 people, to be precise: the delegates who will decide the Republican nomination at the Cleveland convention in July. After his New York massacre on Tuesday, the morning he dropped by, Mr. Cruz says the GOP is ""likely headed"" to a contested convention, where he thinks he can defeat Donald Trump.
This turn is somewhat awkward too. Mr. Cruz, the populist who exalts participatory democracy, will need to convince the delegates that choosing the runner-up is not disenfranchisement. He must also, after running a campaign that targeted the most conservative and religious segments of the electorate, win the support of people who identify as somewhat conservative or moderate, as well as the so-called establishment. And after working so adeptly for years to polarize true believers and their backstabbing elected officials, he must now try to put the party back together.
Mr. Cruz seems to appreciate at least a few of these ironies, and he's more reflective and off-script than normal. With pitiless logic, he rattles off a proof for his candidacy:
This election is one of those ""inflection points in history that change the direction of nations."" A Clinton presidency could leave the U.S. economically irreparable when ""we are perilously, perilously close to that point."" Her Supreme Court appointments would leave the Constitution ""unrecognizable."" National-security threats would ""continue to metastasize.""
There is, he suggests, a single choice. ""Where we are right now, if Donald Trump is the nominee, Hillary wins. I think, looking at the numbers, that is all but indisputable,"" Mr. Cruz says. ""And the only candidate who can beat Donald Trump is me. I recognize there are probably some folks around the table who, in a perfect world, would prefer a John Kasich, would prefer a Paul Ryan, would prefer a long list of other individuals, none of whom I believe have any possibility of defeating Donald Trump.""
If the businessman closes the deal by June, Mr. Cruz says, ""the election is lost and I don't think there's a thing that can be done to save it at that point."" Ergo, for anyone who isn't ready for Hillary, he's the only option. Q.E.D.
As Mr. Cruz sees it, he is ""effectively the last man standing"" out of 17 GOP candidates because of his appeal among ""the Reagan Democrats, union members, working class. Trump has connected powerfully with them. That has been the heart of his base. Our campaign has connected powerfully with them as well, and the reason why I believe I've survived where other candidates didn't is because we could compete head-to-head with Trump for those voters.""
Yet Mr. Cruz concedes that ""to win, we've got to stitch together a broad coalition,"" and so his campaign is now brought to you by the word unity. ""My central focus is unity,"" he says. ""If the non-Trump votes unifies, we beat him.""
Mr. Cruz did consolidate such a coalition when he won two weeks ago in Wisconsin, which he calls ""across the board a broad and unifying victory"" among all political, income and demographic groups. Obviously there was not a similar amount of anti-Trump sentiment in New York, where Mr. Trump won three of five voters -- and Mr. Cruz trailed Mr. Kasich in 25 of 27 districts. The Texan may run no better in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states that vote on Tuesday.
It's true that his New York loss doesn't justify the media's instant somersault from Trump-is-toast to Trump-is-unstoppable stories, and that Mr. Cruz could make progress as the race moves to Indiana, Nebraska and the West Coast. But his problem on the Eastern Seaboard shows that many center-right voters continue to view a Trump-Cruz choice as a Morton's fork. So how does he extend the Wisconsin unity formula?
One new theme is what Mr. Cruz calls his ""tunnel vision"" on ""a positive pro-growth message focused on jobs, on raising wages, on expanding opportunity for young people -- that is a potent message; it's broad-cutting"" he says.
""Tone matters a lot,"" Mr. Cruz adds. ""Nobody is going to vote for a puritanical scold. I'm not running to be preacher in chief,"" says the candidate who appointed a ""national prayer team"" and told Iowa volunteers in December they should ""strap on the full armor of God.""
As for the substance, he talks fluidly about tax reform, and in far more detail than his rival's ballcap-based policy. Rather than the Reagan-era formula of lowering marginal rates and broadening the tax base, Mr. Cruz would create a 10% flat rate on all individual income and swap payroll and corporate taxes for a 16% tax on business receipts -- a form of value-added tax.
""From the beginning,"" Mr. Cruz explains, ""my top priority has been economic growth. I think the only way to turn around the challenges we're facing is getting back to historic levels of growth, 3%, 4%, 5%, and indeed I think we should be aggressively targeting 5% GDP growth.""
Mr. Cruz also says that he wants his tax plan to ""credibly"" speak to the economic worries of average Americans. He explains that ""the distributional component was quite important, and that's a complicated thing to do."" His team worked through a lot of permutations, ""but the problem is every time you ran those numbers, your distributional tables were garbage. Basically, you were preparing a tax plan that, with predictable certitude, everyone would scream is a massive giveaway for the rich and does nothing for the middle class and for the people who are struggling.""
Some conservatives have been skeptical of a VAT because it is such a money machine for government. ""It is very efficient in raising revenue,"" Mr. Cruz grants, ""although I think an economist would say you want a tax to be efficient."" In particular, he says, his plan would eliminate the payroll tax, which ""dwarfs the income tax in terms of what people are paying. And so by eliminating the payroll tax, we're able to have a plan that generates real after-tax income gains at every income level.""
He continues: ""One of the potent virtues of the simple flat tax is its simplicity and universality."" Eliminating progressive taxation, that is, handcuffs the political class, because a tax hike for the rich would be linked to a tax hike on the poor.
""Everything is 10%. You know, one debate we had, some conservatives zero out capital gains and dividends. Going back to the world of plausibly selling this, standing on a debate stage with Hillary Clinton, I don't believe I could with a straight face say I want Warren Buffett's tax to be zero and everyone else to pay taxes,"" Mr. Cruz says. ""If you're going to convince the people to adopt this, I think the fairness and uniformity was a plus.""
Mr. Cruz often says Ronald Reagan overcame the same ""Washington cartel"" that is also his opposition, but he usually elides George W. Bush. Did the most recent Republican president defeat the cartel or was he a member? ""That's a complicated question,"" Mr. Cruz replies. ""I remain a big fan of President Bush's. I'm proud to have been on that campaign. I think he's a good man.""
But Mr. Bush ""did not run as small-government conservative and I'll give him points for candor. He did not pretend to be something he was not . . . . The energy of the administration got swept into keeping this country safe in the wake of 9/11. And I wish more had been done facilitating the rise on the economic ladder on the domestic side.""
Mr. Cruz, a Bush-Cheney 2000 alum, says there were ""a handful of us that dubbed ourselves the Reagan-Goldwater wing of the campaign and we periodically argued perhaps we could limit government spending, although that was a cry that did not fall on fertile ground. I remember at the end of the Bush presidency being at an election-night party with a number of the old campaign staffers. And there was a sense of lost opportunity, that so much more could have accomplished.""
In a 2004 anthology called ""Thank You, President Bush,"" Mr. Cruz contributed an essay on what he called ""opportunity conservatism,"" meaning ""a single-minded focus of easing the means of ascent for those on the bottom of the economic ladder."" Conservative policies and this message of upward mobility, he wrote, ""will resonate with the many 'swing' voters in the middle."" As recently as 2013, in an op-ed in the Washington Post, Mr. Cruz argued that Republicans lost the 2012 election because they did not ""assess policy with a Rawlsian lens, asking how it affects those least well-off among us. We should champion the 47%.""
This style of self-criticism is thoughtful and sophisticated and maybe even true -- and yet opportunity conservatism may be its own lost political opportunity. Mr. Cruz came to a strategic conclusion that he could win the White House by running against the establishment, but the division and fury he and his allies have helped stoke has left the GOP less grand, definitely older and more importantly less of a cohesive party. Thus unity is harder to achieve, even against the threat of Mr. Trump, who a world-historical 65% of the public views negatively, according to the most recent WSJ/NBC News poll.
If a Trump nomination would be ""catastrophic,"" as Mr. Cruz puts it, the best that can be said about his own 49% negative image is that it isn't as high as Mrs. Clinton's, at 56%. Perhaps he could improve his reputation by recovering some of his opportunity-conservative optimism and with an appeal to history as the first Hispanic president. Mr. Cruz also thinks he can win a general election by exposing the ""false but incredibly powerful narrative"" Democrats usually spin, namely, that ""Republicans are rich, out-of-touch aristocrats who don't care about working men and women.""
""We now have an election,"" he continues, ""where Hillary Clinton has made hundreds of millions of dollars exploiting her government service. The last time Hillary drove a car was 1996. You know, in contrast, I mean I had $100,000 of student loans that I just paid off about six, seven years ago. It's one of the reasons why I believe head-to-head I could connect with a single mom waiting tables, who could connect with a truck driver, or, for that matter, with a young person.""
In other words, Mrs. Clinton is less likable than he is, and voters would decide she is comparatively worse. Mr. Cruz has read the primary mood better than most of his competitors -- though he might be better positioned for victory had he sought, all along, the support of all of the people instead of only some of them.

"Map Shrinks for Trump Foes --- As GOP front-runner eyes Tuesday sweep, Cruz, Kasich pin fading hopes on Indiana vote",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784024579?accountid=12768,"ROCKVILLE, Md. -- Donald Trump is poised to sweep five states' Republican primaries on the Eastern Seaboard on Tuesday, but his rivals are already looking ahead to next week's contest in Indiana, which may be their last chance to keep Mr. Trump from clinching the party's presidential nomination.
Polls have shown Mr. Trump leading in Indiana, which votes on May 3. But Sen. Ted Cruz now might have a better shot at beating Mr. Trump in the state, which has 57 delegates, because the Texas senator struck a deal on Sunday with John Kasich that calls for the Ohio governor not to compete in the Hoosier state.
It is a must-win state for anti-Trump forces. If Mr. Trump wins in Indiana after his expected victories on Tuesday, it will be much harder for his rivals to keep him from garnering the 1,237 pledged delegates he needs to win the Republican presidential nomination.
The GOP front-runner has already held one rally in Indianapolis and plans to be there again Wednesday, where his campaign said he would appear with former Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight, a revered figure in the state.
Money is pouring into Indiana. According to a person who tracks media ad buys, the Trump campaign has spent nearly $800,000 on television and radio ads in Indiana. Two anti-Trump PACs have each spent roughly the same amount, and a pro-Cruz super PAC has spent more than $1 million attacking Mr. Kasich. Mr. Cruz's campaign on Monday bought up $903,000 in air time in the state.
Mr. Trump is likely to go there with a strong wind at his back after Tuesday, when he is favored to win in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Those states will be sending 172 delegates to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, and could add to Mr. Trump's momentum after a big win in New York last week.
Mr. Cruz all but threw in the towel on the five-state primary by spending Monday campaigning in Indiana, a state more receptive to his evangelical conservative message than the more-liberal brand of Republicanism in states favoring Mr. Trump.
""The entire country, its eyes are on this great state to choose which path do we want to go down,"" Mr. Cruz said in Borden, Ind., a day after announcing the last-ditch effort with Mr. Kasich to block Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump attacked his rivals over their plan to coordinate campaign strategy against him. ""It shows how weak they are. It shows how pathetic they are,"" Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in Rhode Island. ""It takes two guys, longtime politicians to get together to try to beat Trump, and yet they're way behind.""
The Cruz-Kasich agreement, announced by campaign aides Sunday night, calls for Mr. Kasich to back away from campaigning in Indiana in exchange for the Cruz campaign staying out of Oregon's primary on May 17 and New Mexico's on June 7.
Still, in a sign of the tenuousness of the deal, Mr. Kasich on Monday stopped short of asking his supporters in Indiana to vote for Mr. Cruz, and described the deal as a prudent allocation of campaign resources. Both the Cruz and Kasich campaigns asked their supportive super PACs to follow their lead.
""We want to get to an open convention so we can beat Hillary,"" Mr. Kasich said in an interview after his Rockville rally here on Monday. ""That's what this is all about. I don't want Hillary Clinton to be president, and I think if we go to an open convention, they're going to look at who can win and who can actually run the country.""
Both Trump challengers are facing a stark political reality: The New York businessman, despite being unpopular with party leaders, is the only candidate who has any chance of securing a majority of pledged delegates before the party's convention.
Mr. Trump now has 845 bound delegates, those who are required to back him on the first ballot at the convention. Mr. Cruz has 559 delegates and Mr. Kasich 148. With no chance of achieving the 1,237 majority, the Trump rivals' only strategy is to force a contested convention that goes beyond a first ballot.
""When you have the kind of front-runner who two-thirds of Republican voters don't agree with, you have to go to an open convention,"" said David Beightol, a George H.W. Bush administration veteran who came to see Mr. Kasich at a Monday afternoon town hall event in Rockville. ""It's the only option for us now.""
Mr. Cruz, whose team had rejected past overtures to make such a deal, has only recently conceded that he had no path to win the nomination outright. At this point, he said in Indiana, the deal with Kasich is ""dedicated to the primary goal of being able to beat Hillary Clinton.""
""It is abundantly clear that nobody is getting to 1,237,"" he said. ""We are headed to a contested convention.""
Of the 57 delegates at stake in Indiana, 30 are awarded to the candidate who wins the most votes statewide; the other 27 are awarded to the winner in each of the nine congressional districts.
Despite the Kasich campaign's agreement to avoid Indiana -- he canceled a planned Tuesday swing though the state -- Mr. Kasich on Monday refused a suggestion that he tell his Indiana supporters to back Mr. Cruz.
""I've said all that I have to say about this,"" he said in the Rockville interview. ""I don't tell voters how to vote. They decide and make up their own minds as they do.""
There are inherent dangers for Messrs. Cruz and Kasich in a public collaboration to block Mr. Trump. To some voters, the deal could reek of collusion -- a charge Mr. Trump made on Monday.
""I think it's desperation. It makes no sense,"" said Kevin Hunter of Rockville, a Republican who said Monday that he is undecided between the three candidates. ""For Kasich and Cruz to agree to this after going off on each other for so long makes them look like hypocrites. . . . It just blows my mind that Kasich is going to agree to this deal.""
Mr. Trump, whose aides have claimed he would be striking a more ""presidential"" pose, made fun of Mr. Kasich's eating habits Monday and continued with his penchant for giving derogatory nicknames to his rivals. He said in Rhode Island that he would be calling Mr. Kasich ""1-for-41,"" in reference to his losing record in the primaries and caucuses outside his home state of Ohio.
""Very soon, it's going to be 1 for 46 or 7,"" Mr. Trump added.

Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Cruz-Kasich Pact Latest GOP Stunner,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784024554?accountid=12768,"If you want to see one more amazing thing in this presidential campaign, just wait a few days. It will come along.
And so it was on Sunday night that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced that they had agreed to divide key remaining primary states between them, giving each a better chance to stop Donald Trump head-to-head and force a contested Republican convention.
Is this move a desperate attempt by two failing campaigns to use collusive tactics to stop the clear front-runner, with little chance of success and dangerous repercussions? Or is it a clever move to finally allow real Republicans a chance to show that they want a different outcome, and in the process prevent a general-election disaster?
The answer is that it appears to be some of both. Consider the two competing scenarios -- desperate move with dangerous consequences, or clever move to prevent disaster -- in turn:
DESPERATE MOVE
Mr. Trump's resounding victory in his home-state New York primary significantly changed the dynamic in the race. For the first time, Mr. Trump had cracked the magic 50% barrier in a primary. His near-sweep of the state's delegate trove allowed his advisers to start talking, plausibly, of winning enough delegates outright before the Republican convention to ensure a first-ballot victory there.
The shift in the feel of the race was almost palpable after New York. Party leaders long opposed to Mr. Trump were starting to come to terms with the likelihood of his nomination. An air of inevitability was being created that would have the effect of not only pulling voters toward Mr. Trump in the remaining primaries, but of providing a powerful incentive for the small band of delegates not bound to any candidate to move in his direction.
In short, Messrs. Cruz and Kasich had to do something, and fast, to alter that emerging dynamic. But the potential for backlash is large. The move could turn Mr. Trump into something he normally isn't: a sympathetic figure.
His repeated claims that the Republican primary rules are ""rigged"" to rob him of delegates are a bit dubious. He won 60% of the popular vote in New York but more than 90% of the delegates, and all of Florida's delegates despite winning just 46% of the vote there, because that's what the rules provided.
Now, though, the argument that party leaders are scheming against him will seem more justified. If the move fails, Mr. Trump actually could emerge stronger because of the backlash.
And if the move succeeds -- that is, if Mr. Cruz running alone against Mr. Trump prevails in Indiana, and Mr. Kasich alone against him succeeds in Oregon and New Mexico, and that is enough to prevent Mr. Trump from winning a majority of party delegates -- his supporters will be more enraged at the party's convention in July. The gathering could turn into an ugly mess, and the whole party would suffer.
CLEVER MOVE
A historically large field of Republican contenders this year, combined with the effects of the rules (see above) have in some ways left Mr. Trump appearing stronger than he really is.
The desire among the party's rank and file to stop him is significant but has never asserted itself because the vote opposing him always has been splintered into multiple pieces.
Worse for the Republican Party's conservative activists, who are in many ways its heart and soul, Mr. Trump isn't truly one of them. The voters he has energized have been hijacking the very party that those conservative troops have worked decades to mold.
So this move provides -- belatedly, but at last -- an opportunity to demonstrate the shallowness of Trump support among traditional Republicans. If his status as the front-runner is a fluke, that will be shown. The dynamic will shift again.
Moreover, stopping Mr. Trump could save the party from a general-election disaster. He consistently loses when stacked up against Democrat Hillary Clinton in hypothetical poll matchups, in part because antipathy toward him among women may open up a gender gap of epic proportions.
In the latest Journal/NBC News poll, women said they would pick Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump by 56% to 33%. That 23-point Democratic advantage among women is more than twice as large as the one President Barack Obama enjoyed over GOP nominee Mitt Romney four years ago. Her lead among voters under 30 is similar.
Such a disaster could roll downhill to hit all Republicans. In the Journal/NBC News poll, a quarter of voters said they'd be less likely to vote for Republican congressional candidates if Mr. Trump were the Republican nominee.
So the Cruz/Kasich gambit is a clever move. Or too clever by half. We'll know in a few weeks.

Cruz and Kasich Hang Together,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784023970?accountid=12768,"A Republican primary season replete with surprises saw another on Sunday night, as Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced they'd coordinate in a bid to trigger a contested convention in July. With only 15 states left to vote, and 10 after Tuesday, their concession to reality is better late than never.
This gentleman's agreement didn't emerge from mutual admiration. There aren't enough delegates in play for either the Texas Senator or the Ohio Governor to reach the 1,237 majority that the convention rules require to win on the first ballot. Donald Trump can still reach 1,237 but with a small margin for error.
So Messrs. Cruz and Kasich will divvy up the states where they are respectively stronger to try to pick off delegates. Mr. Kasich won't expend time and money in Indiana's May 3 contest, while the Texan will return the favor in Oregon on May 17 and New Mexico on June 7.
In Indiana in particular, the arrangement sets up the mano-a-mano contest with Mr. Trump that Mr. Cruz says he can win. The Hoosier State's crucial pot of 57 delegates is awarded winner-take-all by congressional district and statewide, and Mr. Trump is leading the polls with his familiar 40% plurality. Messrs. Cruz and Kasich share about 52% in the Real Clear Politics average. Mr. Cruz must now consolidate the anti-Trump vote as he did in Wisconsin, and no excuses if he doesn't.
Mr. Kasich won't gain as much because Oregon and New Mexico award delegates proportionately. But by declining to act as an Indiana spoiler, he makes the open convention on which his fate depends more likely, while building goodwill among delegates who aren't Trump train passengers. He also knows that if he quits the race altogether, many of his supporters will default to Mr. Trump, not Mr. Cruz.
The New York businessman responded with his usual grace under pressure, raging in a statement that, ""It is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person."" He added that he ""would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me.""
But if Mr. Trump is so popular, how could his rivals combine forces to beat him? And if he can win with fewer competitors, then he ought to welcome this ""collusion.""
The truth is that Mr. Trump is a historically weak front-runner -- even Mitt Romney had locked up the nomination by now in 2012 -- who has benefited from a large and fractured field. He's won 37.9% of the popular vote so far, versus 27.9% for Mr. Cruz, 13.7% for Mr. Kasich and 14.9% for Marco Rubio.
But then weakness seems to be the GOP theme of 2016. Mr. Trump maintains a faithful plurality base, but he has won a majority in only one state, New York. Mr. Cruz has failed to expand his appeal beyond the most conservative and evangelical belts. Mr. Kasich is a protest candidate for moderate suburbanites, and his largely biographical campaign hasn't drawn conservatives.
Messrs. Kasich and Cruz's realization they can't stop Mr. Trump alone may come too late, though Mr. Kasich's strategists tried to coordinate a two-front war a month ago. Mr. Cruz rejected the overture. Now they must tell voters to choose not the candidate they prefer on the merits, but to vote instead for the delegates to work their will on the second and later ballots.
The Cruz-Kasich tag team does help feed Mr. Trump's the-system-is-rigged victimology, but tactical voting can only succeed in public, much as Mr. Rubio signaled to his Ohio backers in March to throw in with Mr. Kasich. The strategy's virtue is to clarify the political moment for the Republicans who have yet to vote.
If Mr. Trump is the ""unity"" nominee he claims to be, and which the primary process is designed to achieve, then he'll win a delegate majority by June. If he falls short, then the convention delegates should work to form a consensus around someone who can.",2016-07-01
"Election 2016: Cruz, Kasich Divide States in Effort to Halt Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783864622?accountid=12768,"In a last-ditch effort to stop Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, his two remaining rivals announced Sunday night they are divvying up the upcoming primary states to try to block the New York businessman's path to the GOP nomination.
Top officials from the Ted Cruz and John Kasich campaigns announced the alliance in statements late Sunday night. The deal will keep Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, on the sidelines for Indiana's May 3 primary, while Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, won't compete in contests in Oregon on May 17 and New Mexico on June 7.
""Our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead,"" Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said.
Mr. Kasich's top strategist, John Weaver, made an explicit call for super PACs devoted to stopping Mr. Trump to follow the two campaigns' lead.
The Cruz-Kasich alliance marks a phase both candidates have resisted for months. Both men have rejected calls that they ask supporters to strategically back other candidates in order to stop Mr. Trump, who is the lone Republican with a statistical chance of winning the party's nomination on the first ballot at the GOP's national convention, to be held in July in Cleveland.
The agreement comes as Mr. Trump is in the midst of a successful run of states.
Mr. Trump responded on Twitter Sunday night that Messrs. Cruz and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
Meanwhile, over the weekend, Mr. Cruz's supporters secured 19 of 20 available delegate slots at Maine's GOP convention and at least 36 out of 37 slots at Utah's gathering, among other wins. The success could help Mr. Cruz at the national GOP convention if Mr. Trump fails to secure 1,237 bound delegates in coming months to lock down the GOP nomination on the first ballot.

"Election 2016: Cruz Needs Indiana to Be Like Wisconsin --- State has a favorable profile for the senator, but he hasn't won over local officials or media",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784402691?accountid=12768,"FRANKLIN, Ind. -- For Ted Cruz to stop Donald Trump from seizing the Republican presidential nomination, he must replicate his Wisconsin victory in Indiana, another Midwestern state with similar demographics and population.
But even with Ohio Gov. John Kasich's ceding Indiana to him as part of a nonaggression pact, it's a tall hurdle.
Mr. Cruz has none of the structural advantages he enjoyed in Wisconsin, where the GOP governor and conservative talk-radio hosts backed him. Indiana's most respected Republican voices have stayed neutral, and local conservative media haven't picked sides ahead of the May 3 vote.
""For a Cruz-Kasich axis to pay off, they will need to find a credible voice that has pledged for Kasich and urges others to vote for Cruz,"" said John Hammond, an Indianapolis attorney and member of the Republican National Committee who hasn't endorsed in the race but has expressed deep concerns about Mr. Trump.
So far, such a voice hasn't materialized.
Gov. Mike Pence, locked in an unexpectedly tight re-election battle, has met with all three remaining candidates but declined to endorse any of them. Former Gov. Mitch Daniels, now president of Purdue University, dodged questions about the campaign during a recent appearance on an Indianapolis political talk show. Mr. Daniels's office declined an interview request, and Mr. Pence's office didn't respond to requests for comment.
And while Wisconsin Republicans were united after helping Gov. Scott Walker win three elections, Indiana has seen just one recent high-profile statewide GOP primary -- when Richard Mourdock, then state treasurer, ousted Sen. Richard Lugar in 2012.
Mr. Mourdock's campaign attracted a legion of tea-party activists who are split between the Cruz and Trump camps. Greg Fettig, who founded an anti-Lugar group, said he voted early for Mr. Cruz but predicted Mr. Trump would win the state handily with support from blue-collar voters.
""We're rapidly becoming a former manufacturing state,"" said Mr. Fettig, who is running in a primary for a state House seat in the Indianapolis suburbs. ""Those people are stunned and they are angry.""
Indiana will award 57 delegates -- 30 to the statewide winner and three each to the winner of the state's nine congressional districts. Mr. Trump figures to do well in the northwest, which is home to a struggling steel industry, and in the southwest, where the rural demographic matches regions where the businessman has done well elsewhere.
""Indiana is the highest priority for us,"" said Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
Mr. Cruz's strength is likely to come from the state's northeast, which has a big concentration of social conservatives. For a state that hasn't seen a contested GOP presidential primary since 1976, the intense attention is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
""Folks want as close to an Iowa experience as we can get,"" said Pete Seat, a former George W. Bush official who helped run Mr. Kasich's campaign in the state.
For Mr. Trump, Indiana presents many obstacles he has faced elsewhere. Aides only began organizing here after March 15, said Rex Early, the Trump state chairman. But Mr. Trump's first stop after winning New York's primary last week was at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, and the campaign plans a return with Bob Knight, who coached the Indiana University men's basketball team to three national championships.

"Election 2016: Cruz, Eager For a Spark, Taps Fiorina --- Far behind in fight for delegates, the senator names ex-candidate as his running mate",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784662857?accountid=12768,"Republican Ted Cruz, seeking to change the course of his flagging presidential campaign, on Wednesday named Carly Fiorina as his running mate as he tries to slow the march of Donald Trump toward the party's nomination.
The announcement came a day after big losses in five northeastern states dealt a severe setback to the Texas senator's chances of overtaking the GOP front-runner. Mr. Cruz is betting that Mrs. Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive who ran for president before dropping out in February, will help him prevail next week in Indiana, which has become a must-win state.
The selection drew attention to Mr. Cruz on a day when Mr. Trump, who has called himself the presumptive nominee, turned his focus to the general election by giving a lengthy speech on how he would conduct foreign policy.
Mr. Cruz also hopes that Mrs. Fiorina, 61, will help his chances of peeling away delegates from Mr. Trump in California, which holds a June 7 primary that will offer a final determination of whether the New Yorker can clinch the party's nomination before the Republican National Convention. Mrs. Fiorina won a tough GOP Senate primary in California as a political unknown in 2010 before losing to incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer.
""I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice-presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina,"" Mr. Cruz told supporters in Indianapolis.
The danger for Mr. Cruz, 45, is that voters will see the announcement, combined with his alliance with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who agreed to refrain from campaigning in Indiana, as last-gasp political maneuvering.
Mr. Cruz dedicated the bulk of his speech with Mrs. Fiorina to bashing Mr. Trump, who holds a commanding delegate advantage heading into Indiana's primary Tuesday.
Mrs. Fiorina, after Mr. Cruz introduced her to the Indianapolis crowd, implored voters to give her and Mr. Cruz a victory in Indiana and the opportunity to compete with Mr. Trump in the nine other states still to hold primary contests.
""This is a fight for all of us, for our party, for our future, for our children's future,"" said Mrs. Fiorina, who endorsed the Texas senator in March and has been among his most faithful and energetic surrogates. Of the Republican campaign, she insisted: ""It isn't over.""
Positioning himself as down-and-out isn't necessarily the worst move for Mr. Cruz in Indiana, where the state's tradition of revering underdogs is celebrated in the movie ""Hoosiers.""
""The essence of Indiana is we cheer for guys who are down and punish guys who are ahead,"" said Mark Souder, who represented northeast Indiana as a Republican in Congress for 15 years. ""It might be seen as desperate. That doesn't mean we're going to go against him.""
The move also signals that Mr. Cruz isn't likely to win any significant new endorsements from key Indiana Republicans who have remained neutral in the presidential race, such as Gov. Mike Pence and former Gov. Mitch Daniels. Mr. Pence on Wednesday was more than 100 miles away from Indianapolis, where both Messrs. Cruz and Trump had events planned.
Not since 1976, when Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford battled to the GOP convention, has a Republican presidential candidate announced a vice-presidential pick before it was clear he would be the nominee.
James Bopp Jr., a former member of the Republican National Committee from Terre Haute, Ind., said Mr. Cruz's naming of Mrs. Fiorina could help him win over business-minded Republicans in the Indianapolis suburbs who had been inclined to back Mr. Kasich before he abandoned the state on Sunday night.
""She's not a moderate, but she's obviously a culturally upscale, successful businesswoman extraordinaire,"" Mr. Bopp said. ""That has some appeal in the doughnut counties around Indianapolis that are packed with Republicans and upscale Republican voters.""
Mrs. Fiorina saw her own presidential ambitions end after winning just a single delegate from Iowa. She since has campaigned both with Mr. Cruz and on her own.

The Cruz-Fiorina Ticket,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784662806?accountid=12768,"Ted Cruz hasn't won the Republican nomination and will have an even harder time stopping Donald Trump after Tuesday, but that isn't stopping him from filling out his Administration. On Wednesday he announced that his running mate would be Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and presidential contender.
The announcement, more than two months before the Cleveland convention, looks like a political Hail Mary, and it probably is. Next Tuesday's Indiana primary is a must win for Mr. Cruz, who wants to change the political conversation from Mr. Trump's recent victories. Ms. Fiorina endorsed Mr. Cruz in early March, before the primaries in Florida and Ohio, and the two can now make the cable TV rounds in the runup to Tuesday.
Ms. Fiorina has her virtues as a governing choice, not least her intelligence and policy chops. Her conservative positions on cultural issues like abortion and same-sex marriage will appeal to the party's base. Mr. Cruz may also hope that choosing a woman will broaden his appeal and reinforce the image he's tried to project as a political outsider. It's even possible she could give him a boost on June 7 in California, where she won the GOP Senate nomination in 2010.
On the other hand, Ms. Fiorina's hard-edged rhetorical conservatism reinforces one of Mr. Cruz's political weaknesses. As the nominee he would need to reach out to the GOP's moderate wing and independents to have any chance in November. Why foreclose a chance to pick Marco Rubio (Florida) or John Kasich (Ohio) if he wins the nomination?
The other risk is that choosing a running mate so far from Cleveland removes the chance for Mr. Cruz to use his choice of a running mate as a bargaining chip if there is an open convention. Ms. Fiorina has no delegates she can release to the Texan, but Messrs. Rubio and Kasich do. His VP gambit shows that Mr. Cruz realizes that Cleveland doesn't matter if he can't make it out of Indiana.",2016-07-06
A Cruz Postmortem,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786757159?accountid=12768,"Revolutions tend to devour their own, and so Ted Cruz finally became the main course in Indiana on Tuesday. The Senator's ruin-to-rule campaign strategy was years in the making but didn't anticipate Donald Trump, who turned out to be the greater revolutionary.
After Mr. Cruz's Wisconsin victory a month ago, the GOP's not-Trump wing seemed strong enough to deny the businessman the nomination. Their alternative was Mr. Cruz, who arranged the one-on-one contest in Indiana he said he could win.
But in seven straight contests after Wisconsin the GOP electorate peered at the Texan and the New Yorker, compared their merits, and decided they preferred Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz's ratings among Republicans tanked over the last two weeks, according to Gallup, with 39% favorable and 45% unfavorable views. In January his net approval was 54 points higher.
The reasons for this crash go back to Mr. Cruz's strategy to run for President that began from his earliest days in the Senate in 2013. He calculated he couldn't stand out in the presidential pack if he merely attacked President Obama and Hillary Clinton. So he and his allies at the Heritage Foundation and the Mark Levin talk-radio right put together a strategy to inflame populist resentment against the GOP Congress and catapult Mr. Cruz to the White House.
In the narrative they contrived, true conservatives are forever betrayed by the corrupt leaders of what Mr. Cruz called ""the Washington cartel."" Thus they set up impossible feats of strength like the ObamaCare government shutdown, or phony tests of political purity on drones and gun control. Mr. Cruz also saw immigration as a wedge for the base and made it his signature.
The strategy raised Mr. Cruz's profile among conservatives, but one price was to stigmatize all other GOP candidates as ""establishment,"" even conservative Governors. Another was to set the stage for Mr. Trump, who co-opted the rebellion.
The billionaire became the more effective and polarizing outsider. He called for mass deportation and making Mexico pay for the wall. He doubled down on protectionism. Mr. Cruz tried to move further to the right on nativism and trade, including the spectacle of renouncing his endorsement of trade promotion authority the day before the vote, but he could never outflank Mr. Trump.
Far from challenging the New Yorker, Mr. Cruz helped to normalize Mr. Trump's message. In July 2015, Mr. Cruz told Sean Hannity that ""Donald"" is ""a friend of mine. . . . He's bold and brash and he's willing to speak the truth."" In another interview that month, he added that ""the Washington cartel supports amnesty and I think amnesty is wrong and I salute Donald Trump for focusing on it.""
As late as December he tweeted that Mr. Trump is ""terrific,"" declining the ""cage match"" with Mr. Trump that Mr. Cruz claimed the establishment wanted. The Trump love-in caucus, with Mr. Cruz and conservative media celebrities as members, enhanced the New Yorker's credibility. Mr. Cruz's praise also undermined the moral case against Mr. Trump's politics.
All of this worked for a while -- until Mr. Trump turned on Mr. Cruz. The Texan's late attacks on the businessman lacked credibility because Mr. Cruz had said the opposite only weeks earlier. By the end in Indiana he tried to link Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton, but Mr. Trump's image was already firmly set among primary voters.
On Tuesday Mr. Cruz left the race, but not before saying, ""I'm going to do something I haven't done for the entire campaign. I'm going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump."" He then called him ""the biggest narcissist"" and a ""pathological liar,"" confirming in the process that Mr. Cruz had been the one lying all along.
Mr. Cruz's pandering to the right also sent a signal to moderate and somewhat conservative Republicans that he didn't need their support. Mr. Trump split the ""very conservative"" vote with Mr. Cruz but crushed the Senator among more moderate voters. That doomed Mr. Cruz in the East in particular, but also in Indiana.
The Texan's lost opportunity was to expand his appeal beyond his most conservative base of support and coalesce mainstream Republicans. He never tried to break out of his factional ghetto, as if excoriating the establishment and transgender bathroom laws could motivate a majority to defeat Mr. Trump's plurality.
The conservatives aghast at Mr. Trump should appreciate the irony that even as Mr. Cruz hoped to produce a new conservative era, he helped wreck the best chance for conservative reform in years.",2016-07-08
Election 2016: Indiana Poll Bears Good News for Trump --- The GOP front-runner could cement his position in a state that Cruz has long sought,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785699242?accountid=12768,"The home stretch of the long 2016 GOP presidential race is coming into view, and the path to victory is opening wider for front-runner Donald Trump amid signs that he could pick up a big win in Tuesday's Indiana primary.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds Mr. Trump ahead by 15 points among likely Republican primary voters in Indiana, pointing to a victory that would significantly boost the businessman's chances of clinching the Republican presidential nomination before the party's convention in Cleveland.
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, his chief rival, continued to voice confidence that he could keep Mr. Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the nomination either before the convention or on the first ballot. But Mr. Cruz needs Indiana's primary to be a pivot point.
""The country is really depending on Indiana to choose the direction of this race,"" Mr. Cruz said on NBC, in one of five television appearances broadcast Sunday morning.
Mr. Trump said a victory in Indiana would effectively end the contest. ""If we win Indiana, it's over, OK?"" he said at a rally in the state on Sunday.
If Mr. Trump won all 57 of Indiana's delegates, he would have 1,012 bound delegates, leaving him 225 short of the magic number. He would then need 49.45% of the bound delegates remaining to be allocated -- the first time that figure would drop below 50% for any candidate in the race.
The Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday bolstered the hopes of Trump supporters, showing that 49% of likely Republican primary voters favored Mr. Trump, compared with 34% for Mr. Cruz and 13% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
The poll also surveyed likely Democratic voters in Indiana and found Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead, 50% to 46%, over Sen. Bernie Sanders. With Mr. Sanders trailing significantly in the delegate count, the poll result suggests that the outcome in Indiana isn't likely to change the dynamic of a nomination fight.
Mr. Trump has been on a winning streak since his landslide victories in the New York primary two weeks ago and in last week's five-state round of voting in the Northeast, which some dubbed the ""Acela primary"" after the Boston-Washington Amtrak train service.
""After the Acela primary, there is an aura of inevitability surrounding the Trump and Clinton candidacies,"" said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion.
Mr. Cruz's supporters have been hopeful about Indiana because it is a deeply conservative state with an influential community of evangelical Christians, the kind of voters who are part of the Texas senator's base. Mr. Cruz won the endorsement Friday of the state's governor, Mike Pence. But Mr. Pence also praised Mr. Trump and hasn't joined the ""stop-Trump"" chorus.
John Hammond, a Republican National Committee member from Indiana who is neutral in the race, said Mr. Cruz's organization in the state is superior to that of his rivals, but that it may be no match for Mr. Trump's unconventional appeal. ""This appears to me to be a state that Trump is going to win,"" said Mr. Hammond.
A candidate could sweep all 57 delegates in Indiana by winning the vote statewide and in all nine congressional districts. Even if Mr. Trump were to do that, he still would need to wait until June 7, the last day of the primary season, to secure the needed 1,237 delegates. Five states vote then, including California, with its trove of 172 delegates.
That is where Mr. Cruz's sights are turned, win or lose in Indiana. He spoke to California's GOP convention Saturday and picked up the endorsement of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.
The Cruz campaign has also continued to work at state conventions to ensure his supporters fill delegate slots, even if they are bound to vote for Mr. Trump on the first convention ballot.
His team scored another such victory in Arizona. Mr. Trump had won the state's primary, but a state GOP convention on Saturday placed Cruz supporters in most of the state's 58 delegate slots.
There was no such Cruz takeover at Delaware's state GOP convention Saturday, which approved a slate of 16 delegates. Most who spoke seemed prepared to back Mr. Trump beyond the first ballot.

Election 2016: A Defiant Cruz Returns to Senate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787894443?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Ted Cruz returned to the Senate from the presidential campaign trail Tuesday, confronting anew the colleagues whose dislike for him became a badge of honor in his campaign as a political outsider.
Speaking to a throng of reporters as he returned to his Capitol Hill office for the first time since he suspended his campaign, the Texas senator again refused to endorse the party's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.
He seemed emboldened by his unexpectedly strong showing in the race, not humbled by losing, and showed no interest in being more accommodating to the Washington establishment he campaigned against. ""If fighting for the American people makes you an outsider in the Senate, then I will happily remain one,"" said Mr. Cruz, who suspended his campaign last week following a resounding defeat in the Indiana primary.
Still, Mr. Cruz -- in his comments to reporters and earlier in an interview with conservative talk host Glenn Beck -- hinted he would leave open the door to restarting his campaign if circumstances changed dramatically.
""The reason we suspended the race last week is with Indiana's loss, I didn't see a viable path to victory,"" he said to Mr. Beck. ""If that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.""
But he also said, ""I am not holding my breath. My assumption is that will not happen.""
Before launching back into the life of the Capitol, Mr. Cruz on Monday night thanked supporters in a conference call and urged his delegates to the national convention to remain engaged and ensure that the party's conservative platform isn't diluted.
""The role I think we're going to play is to maintain a strong and healthy platform,"" said Kay Godwin, a Cruz delegate from Georgia who participated in the conference call. ""I don't think there's going to be any hanky-panky with Donald Trump and his nomination. That's a done deal.""
Many Cruz backers are worried about Mr. Trump's willingness to stray from conservative orthodoxy on issues from taxes to foreign policy to abortion. His supporters could have a lot to say about the party's policy commitments if they dominate the convention's platform committee.
For now, much of Mr. Cruz's attention will turn back to the Senate, where he was one of five members to run for president in 2016. Only Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent seeking the Democratic nomination, is still in the running.
Already back in the Senate from the 2016 trail are GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Mr. Cruz's surprisingly strong finish may earn him some grudging respect, even from Mr. Graham, who recently joked that ""if you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.""
Now, Mr. Graham concedes, ""The process did elevate him. How he uses that will be up to him.""
The campaign also highlighted how profoundly unpopular Mr. Cruz is among Senate Republicans. For most of the campaign only one Senate colleague, Mike Lee of Utah, endorsed him; a few others came around to announcing support for him when he was the last chance to stop Mr. Trump.
But as he campaigned, he bragged about his pariah status in the Senate, which arose in large part from the confrontational tactics that put other Republicans on the spot -- such as his unsuccessful effort to cut off funding for the Affordable Care Act, which provoked a partial government shutdown.
""When we launched our campaign, the New York Times promptly opined, 'Cruz cannot win because the Washington elites despise him,'"" he would often say on the stump. ""I kinda thought that was the whole point of the campaign.""
His colleagues say they will welcome him back, but most suspect he will be no less inclined to spar with his fellow Republicans than before he began his long and nearly successful bid.
""That's kind of how he has built his political brand; it got him elected to the Senate and it served him reasonably well as a presidential candidate,"" said Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.). ""He may very well pick up where he left off.""
And Mr. Cruz may not be ready to leave off his presidential ambitions, as many supporters expect him to run again in 2020.
Mr. Cruz himself, in his concession speech after the Indiana primary, strongly suggested that this wouldn't be his last foray onto the national political scene, alluding to his hero, Ronald Reagan, and the 1976 Republican convention.
That was when Mr. Reagan failed in his effort to wrest the GOP nomination from President Gerald Ford. But he then went on in 1980 to win the nomination and to beat President Jimmy Carter in the general election.

Information Age: A Job for Rubio-Cruz: Save the Web,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790307955?accountid=12768,"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, back from the campaign trail, have something productive to do in Washington. They've taken the lead against President Obama's plan to give up U.S. protection of the open Internet.
The Obama administration announced in 2014 it would end U.S. oversight by canceling the Commerce Department's long-standing contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann. Despite enormous effort over the past two years by the multi-stakeholder community of network engineers and developers, no one found an alternative to U.S. stewardship that would protect the global Internet from censorship by authoritarian regimes.
The Obama administration pledged that it wouldn't let other governments get more power, but the plan it is considering would do just that. Governments for the first time would get a say in Icann board membership. It would take a majority of the Icann board to reject advice from governments, and stakeholders would have no legal standing to intervene.
Last week the House passed its third straight annual appropriations bill banning the Obama administration from ending the Icann contract. That would continue U.S. oversight into fiscal 2017, so the next president could decide to retain U.S. protection.
In a draft letter to the Commerce Department ahead of this week's Senate hearings, Sen. Rubio says the administration's plan to replace U.S. oversight ""would create a radically different governance structure for Icann,"" which includes ""an expanded role of governments.""
The senator wants the current contract renewed until officials can ""ensure that the many changes in the transition proposal are implemented, operate as envisioned, and do not contain unforeseen problems, oversights, or complications that could undermine the multi-stakeholder model or threaten the openness, security, stability, or resiliency of the Internet.""
Sen. Cruz, joined by Sens. James Lankford and Mike Lee, goes further. His letter points out that Iran is already plotting to move Icann out of the legal jurisdiction of the U.S., which would make it impossible to enforce protections. He also cites the constitutional requirement that Congress must vote to approve any transfer of ""government property."" Icann's domain-registration business earns hundreds of millions of dollars a year, making this a transfer of property worth billions.
The Obama administration was naive to think unilaterally giving up oversight of Icann would placate authoritarian regimes. Even the Commerce Department admits as much. It issued a rare statement this month criticizing China for its recent draft policy that would require all websites serving China to have their domains approved by Beijing, not by Icann.
Commerce correctly concluded China's move would ""formalize an explicit system of online censorship,"" giving Beijing new leverage over Google, Facebook and global news publishers.
Mike Daniels, the former chief executive of Network Solutions, which administered Internet Protocol addresses in the 1990s, recently warned in the Hill: ""He who controls all IP addresses controls the Internet."" Mr. Daniels added: ""The vision of a free and open Internet is increasingly at risk because repressive governments have turned back the tide of Internet freedom.""
Few tech media outlets are reporting the risks from the planned radical changes to Internet governance. Many tech reporters have simply accepted the Obama administration's disingenuous claim that the U.S. role is merely ""clerical.""
It's as clerical as the passage of the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea: The U.S. defends the open Internet by making sure no one else interferes, just as it dispatches ships to ensure that the sea lanes stay open.
Trade journalists covering Web registry understand better. Icann ""has been extremely resistant to efforts to reform it and has gone out of its way to frustrate and undermine proposals from the Internet community that it did not agree with,"" Kieren McCarthy of the Register, a London-based publisher, wrote last week. ""Concern over whether the reforms to Icann will prove sufficient is all too real. . . . If Marco Rubio is asking for a delay until this latest set of reforms can be seen to be working, he's not acting irrationally, he's simply noting history.""
Icann Chairman Steve Crocker last month defended the administration's plan in an op-ed for this newspaper. ""There are no guarantees about the Internet's future,"" he wrote. He is right -- but only if the U.S. gives up stewardship of the Internet. So long as the U.S. retains ultimate control, other countries won't get access to censor the Web in the U.S. or elsewhere outside their own countries.
Congress should save the Internet by stopping President Obama's plan. Authoritarian regimes can get the power to censor the Web globally only if the U.S. hands it to them.

"Election 2016: Trump Stirs Up Capitol With His Visit --- Cruz warms to candidate, others remain icy after meetings on the Hill",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805654804?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, still working to secure the support of reluctant Republicans in Congress, reached a detente with his most formidable primary rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, but clashed with his critics during closed-door meetings Thursday.
In the high point of his second visit this year to Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump won Mr. Cruz's commitment to speak at the GOP convention this month, a long-delayed rapprochement expected to help Mr. Trump win over his former opponent's conservative supporters.
But the New York businessman continued to provoke other Republicans, showing little willingness to rein in the contentious statements that have caused heartburn in the party. The tensions were on display in a sharp exchange with Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) and in questions from concerned Republicans on immigration and other issues.
Mr. Trump met with more than 215 House Republicans and many from the Senate in separate gatherings, followed by a private meeting with Mr. Cruz, according to a statement from the senator's office. It was the first meeting between the bitter rivals since the senator suspended his presidential campaign in May.
Mr. Cruz didn't endorse Mr. Trump, but his willingness to speak at the convention is the clearest sign yet that the conservative lawmaker won't try to hinder Mr. Trump's campaign in the four months left until his showdown against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The meeting seemed to mark the end of the animosity that had long flared between the Trump and Cruz campaigns. Before Mr. Cruz dropped out, Mr. Trump maligned him as ""Lyin' Ted"" and accused his father of being complicit in the John F. Kennedy assassination. In the last day of his campaign, Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump a ""pathological liar"" and a ""narcissist.""
Mr. Cruz has made no secret of his desire to run for president again and has told people privately he believes 2016 is a repeat of 1976, when Ronald Reagan lost a nomination battle to Gerald Ford before taking the White House four years later.
But even while Mr. Trump made peace with one of his former foes, he took on other lawmakers in meetings that turned combative at times. In one of the day's most confrontational exchanges, Mr. Trump chastised Mr. Flake for criticizing him publicly, saying that up until now he hadn't personally attacked Mr. Flake but could start to, according to accounts from Mr. Flake and other people familiar with the exchange.
Mr. Flake, who has disavowed many of Mr. Trump's stances and hasn't endorsed him, told Mr. Trump he wanted to be able to support him, but found it hard amid the candidate's stream of incendiary comments, like those about the ""Mexican heritage"" of the Indiana-born federal judge overseeing the lawsuit against Trump University. Mr. Trump said the judge's lineage was a conflict due to Mr. Trump's pledge to seal the Mexican border.
Mr. Flake referred to himself as the ""other senator from Arizona -- the one who wasn't captured,"" in a reference to fellow Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, which Mr. Trump has diminished.
When Mr. Trump blamed the media for distorting his comments, Mr. Flake responded he was referring to direct quotes, the senator said.
Mr. Trump did well in the GOP primary, but will have to secure much broader support to win in November, Mr. Flake said in an interview after the meeting. ""That's difficult to do when he seems to be going out of his way to offend certain demographic groups.""
Mr. Trump also belittled Sen. Mark Kirk, the Illinois Republican locked in a tight re-election race who rescinded his endorsement of Mr. Trump last month. Mr. Trump called Mr. Kirk a ""loser"" and predicted he would lose his race, according to someone familiar with the discussion. Mr. Kirk wasn't present at the meeting.
Mr. Trump also said he believed Mr. Kirk privately supported him but felt he had to publicly disavow him, according to two people familiar with his remarks.
Mr. Kirk said he didn't have any reaction to Mr. Trump's comments, and predicted that Mr. Trump wouldn't win in Democratic-leaning Illinois.
Mr. Trump faced tough questions from House Republicans, who pressed him on his approach to Hispanic voters. Mr. Trump early in his campaign said many Hispanics crossing the southern border are rapists and criminals. Rep. Cresent Hardy, a Nevada Republican facing a tight re-election race, asked Mr. Trump how his campaign style would register in swing states like Nevada, with a large Hispanic population.
Mr. Trump told House Republicans his polling has shown Hispanics support him more strongly than they did Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee in 2012. Mr. Hardy said he was satisfied by Mr. Trump's response that he was confident he could win swing states, but others remained skeptical.
Mr. Trump's pitch to lawmakers highlighted his argument that Republicans should want him to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy and any others in the next four years.
""He made the point over and over again and I think he's right: 'Even if some of you don't agree with me, look at the Supreme Court,'"" said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R., Neb.). Mr. Fortenberry said he would vote for Mr. Trump but didn't want ""to be proximate to unstudied remarks or bluster.""

A Coy Cruz Awaits His Podium Moment,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805438791?accountid=12768,"Cleveland -- The Republican National Convention this year is the most freewheeling in decades, and one of the great will-he-or-won't-he moments has yet to unfold. It will come Wednesday night, in the prime-time hour featuring Ted Cruz.
The question: Will Mr. Cruz endorse Donald Trump? Or will he instead use his premium airtime to enunciate his own vision for the GOP? (Or will he awkwardly attempt to do both?) Mr. Cruz isn't saying. The Texas senator has stayed resolutely mum on his plans, which has only heightened the media chatter.
In a long interview on Monday, Politico's chief political correspondent, Glenn Thrush, tried several ways to get the senator to say whether he planned to board the Trump Train. Mr. Cruz kept coy: ""In this election I am where a great many voters are, which is that I am listening and watching and coming to a decision.""
When Mr. Trump met with Mr. Cruz in early July and offered him a convention speaking slot, with no conditions attached, he must have assumed that the gesture would bring the Texan around. But Mr. Cruz's Politico interview revealed how aggrieved he still feels about losing to Mr. Trump. ""I think Hillary's nomination and I think Donald Trump's nomination, I think the media played decisive roles in both of them,"" he said.
Mr. Cruz also wasn't shy during the primary in skewering Mr. Trump, calling him everything from ""utterly amoral"" to a ""pathological liar"" to ""part of the same corrupt system"" that voters are angry about -- insults he has never taken back.
The bigger point is that Mr. Cruz is clearly gauging how best to set himself up for 2020, should Mr. Trump's bid for the White House fail. The senator has never been shy about his presidential ambitions, and while this year's primary washout was a disappointment, he knows that his second-place finish makes him a top contender for the next go-round. In his Politico interview, Mr. Cruz could not have telegraphed this more clearly.
""What I'm looking forward to is changing the course this country is on,"" he said. ""I don't know if that happens in this election cycle or not . . ."" He noted that his ""focus is not on any one particular election or any one particular candidate,"" but on ""issues and policy."" And again: ""This is a battle that is a much bigger battle than one election, one campaign or one candidate.""
The risk Mr. Cruz takes, however, if he refuses to endorse this year's nominee is that he could make enemies of the party and Trump faithful. The senator has a history of staking out positions, particularly when the spotlight is available, that earn him the animus of those who might be able to help him. Just ask his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate. An endorsement of the party's putative nominee on Wednesday night is no sure thing.

GOP Split as Cruz Snubs Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805706622?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- Sen. Ted Cruz refused to endorse Donald Trump on Wednesday night, leaving delegates at the Republican National Convention shouting angrily, and laying bare the rift between traditional conservatives and the populist candidate.
In a dramatic prime-time address the day after Mr. Trump officially won the nomination, the Texas senator congratulated Mr. Trump by name for the victory and then never mentioned him again, drawing boos as he concluded his speech.
The episode laid bare fissures that have complicated the Trump campaign's efforts to broaden his appeal and unify the party behind him before entering what's expected to be a brutal general election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.
It came after the collapse on Monday of the stop-Trump movement that had spent months trying to upend Mr. Trump's nomination. While Mr. Cruz never directly participated in or blessed that campaign, it was orchestrated at every stage by his supporters.
Mr. Cruz's prime speaking spot was offered to him -- the longest time allotment of any of Mr. Trump's GOP rivals -- to try to defuse the intraparty fight. The dramatic refusal by Mr. Cruz to fulfill the Republican candidates' pledge to back the primary victor, a man who insulted his family and offended his conservative principles, is likely to propel Mr. Cruz's standing among many movement advocates.
Mr. Trump, on Twitter, reacted to Mr. Cruz's snub by saying, ""wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage."" The nominee said he'd learned two hours earlier that the senator wasn't going to endorse him, ""but let him speak anyway.""
The closest Mr. Cruz came to an endorsement was a bland exhortation to vote. ""Please, don't stay home in November,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.""
The crowd roared. But as Mr. Cruz wound down his speech and it became clear there was no forthcoming Trump endorsement, many in the crowd started chanting, ""Trump, Trump, Trump!"" Others started booing the Texan. Entire sections shook their heads in disappointment.
Mr. Trump created his own distraction toward the end of Mr. Cruz's speech. Knowing Mr. Cruz had no plans to back him, he stepped into view, drawing the sights of cameras across the arena, as the Texan concluded his remarks.
""Sore loser,"" Joe Mathis, a 68-year-old delegate from Alaska said of Mr. Cruz, as he leaned over to the woman seated next to him. ""Ted Cruz had a chance to bring the party together,"" he said. ""It's a shame. It didn't help the party.""
Mr. Cruz's speech brought furious criticism from some of Mr. Trump's big supporters. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called it a ""betrayal"" on Facebook. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, on Twitter, said, ""tonight Ted Cruz demonstrated he is willing to place self before country.""
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, on ABC television, called the speech ""awful"" and ""selfish.""
Former Florida Sen. George LeMieux, who backed Mr. Trump's defeated rivals Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio before endorsing Mr. Trump, said Mr. Cruz should have offered an endorsement.
""It's amazing to me that Ted Cruz would come to Donald Trump's convention and be given the privilege of speaking and not endorse him,"" Mr. LeMieux said. ""He really hurt himself tonight with the grass roots.""
Mr. Cruz's refusal to back Mr. Trump comes 10 weeks after the end of a bitter primary battle between the two, in which Mr. Trump christened him ""Lyin' Ted,"" mocked his wife's appearance and accused Mr. Cruz's father of having complicity in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Before he suspended his campaign in May, Mr. Cruz slammed Mr. Trump as a ""pathological liar."" Neither man has recanted their description of the other.
While Mr. Trump's supporters have called for the GOP to unite behind him, Mr. Cruz told the convention hall that the onus is on Mr. Trump to do the uniting.
""We deserve leaders who stand for principle,"" he said. ""Unite us all behind shared values. Cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect, from everybody.""
Mr. Cruz's remarks marked the convention's most electric moment, calling for the Republican Party to adhere to his brand of conservative values -- an implicit criticism of Mr. Trump's populism.
The Texas senator's rebuke of the party's nominee came after Mr. Trump's aides spent recent days hinting to reporters that they should expect Mr. Cruz to finally endorse Mr. Trump.
Wednesday night's scene left the two men no closer to an endorsement, even though many of Mr. Cruz's supporters are now backing the nominee. Several delegates on the convention floor held signs that read ""Cruz delegate for Trump.""
Matt Schultz, the former Iowa secretary of state who was the chairman of Mr. Cruz's Iowa campaign, said he is backing Mr. Trump and expects most of the Cruz coalition to do so, too, eventually.

As late as December, Mr. Cruz tweeted: ""The Establishment's only hope: Trump & me in a cage match. Sorry to disappoint -- @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt.""
All of this is worth recalling now that some are hailing Mr. Cruz as a conservative hero for refusing to endorse Mr. Trump in his convention speech Wednesday night. Instead, the Texan pointedly didn't mention Mr. Trump when he said ""we deserve leaders who stand for principle, who unite us all behind shared values, who cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect from everybody.""
Therefore, he added, ""vote your conscience"" for ""candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom, and to be faithful to the Constitution."" Delegates figured out the sly anti-endorsement and hurled boos and catcalls at the stage.
Mr. Cruz's sudden burst of ""conscience"" would be more believable if Mr. Cruz hadn't played Tonto to Mr. Trump's Lone Ranger for most of the primary campaign. When it mattered last year, when Mr. Trump still might have been stopped, Mr. Cruz was lip-syncing the businessman's lines.
While other candidates were opposing Mr. Trump on immigration, Mr. Cruz was imitating him and even moving to his right. Mr. Cruz wrote an op-ed in this paper with Paul Ryan supporting trade promotion authority. After Mr. Trump opposed it, Mr. Cruz came out against the bill right before the Senate vote.
Principled opposition? Mr. Cruz was Donald Trump's leading enabler.
It's true that Mr. Cruz changed his tone as Mr. Trump targeted him and his wife with insults and smeared his father. But that was long after Mr. Trump had done the same to other Republican contenders. Mr. Cruz was praising Mr. Trump when others were the targets.
If Mr. Cruz doesn't want to vote for Mr. Trump, fair enough. But then he should have stayed off the convention stage like Jeb Bush and John Kasich. His stage-managed refusal to endorse looks less like a matter of principle than it does a gambit to position himself for running again in 2020 if Donald Trump loses in November. He'll pretend he warned Republicans about nominating Mr. Trump, while Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and Mr. Ryan endorsed the New Yorker.
Mr. Cruz also managed to steal the day-after headlines from Mike Pence, who gave an excellent acceptance speech as the vice presidential nominee on Wednesday. Mr. Pence offered a message of Reagan-like optimism about how to move America forward. The contrast of his modesty with Mr. Cruz's self-interested calculation is a lesson to remember for 2020.",2016-10-19
The Republican Convention: Cruz Took a Calculated Risk in Address,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806008117?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and his top aides this week concluded that they couldn't avoid some blame for party fissures after his backers spent months trying to block Donald Trump's path to the Republican presidential nomination.
So there seemed to be no additional risk in urging convention delegates to ""vote your conscience"" -- a clearly loaded message to Trump supporters who fought for the last month to defeat a ""conscience"" clause that would have unbound delegates from the nominee.
Now, after his speech prompted a chaotic scene of delegates -- egged on by the Trump team -- screaming and booing at him, the recalculations have begun.
For Mr. Cruz, a first-term senator already planning a future presidential run, the question is whether he has positioned himself to be the leader of a post-Trump GOP or so angered Republicans that he foreclosed on success in a future national campaign.
""There's no one who will forget last night in the Republican Party,"" said Whit Ayers, a polling expert who has worked in Republican politics for three decades.
Other GOP strategists see Mr. Cruz betting on Republicans' tendency in years past to choose the candidate seen as ""the next in the line"" -- and maneuver himself into that role.
If Mr. Trump loses, ""he's betting that we go back to form"" and that the party continues its rightward move, said Stewart Verdery, the founder of lobbying and public-affairs firm Monument Policy Group and a former Senate Republican aide. ""If his goal is to be president, it's a good bet.""
The showdown on the convention floor was no accident.
Mr. Cruz told Mr. Trump on Monday that he would not endorse him and distributed a transcript of his remarks hours before he took to the stage. Still, Trump officials have for the past week suggested Mr. Cruz would make a dramatic endorsement during his convention speech.
""They knew ahead of time that we weren't going to endorse and they had our speech ahead of time,"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Thursday.
But pro-Trump delegates on the floor interpreted Mr. Cruz's use of the phrase ""vote your conscience,"" without a definitive endorsement to follow, as a denunciation of the party's nominee.
When it was evident Mr. Cruz would not respond to the crowd's boisterous protest with an impromptu endorsement, pandemonium broke out on the convention floor.
The party is now essentially split into three camps: Trump supporters, the ""Never-Trump"" crowd, and those who are wary of their nominee but feel obligated to support him.
""Ted shouldn't have gone out there and said something that was clearly intended to cause controversy,"" said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who endorsed his former primary rival, said in a Thursday radio interview. ""He was implying people shouldn't vote for Trump.""
Mr. Cruz's defiant speech split even his own supporters. During an appearance at a Thursday breakfast of the Texas GOP here, delegates were screaming at each other and shouting at Mr. Cruz, even while some gave him a standing ovation.
Rep. Pete Sessions (R., Texas), serving as the convention's parliamentarian this year, said roughly three-quarters of the Texas delegation disapproved of his refusal to endorse Mr. Trump, with the remaining quarter backing Mr. Cruz.
Mr. Cruz's convention stand will only isolate him more in Washington, where he has used his hostile relationship with GOP leaders to define his own political brand, as he reminded Texas delegates Thursday morning.
""Anytime you stand up to [former House Speaker] John Boehner and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell, leadership screams . . . 'Sit down, shut up, just support the team,' "" Mr. Cruz said. ""Dammit, if that's the price, I ain't going to do it,"" he said.
