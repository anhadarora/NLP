"Martin O'Malley to Drop Out of Democratic Presidential Race; Campaign overshadowed by Clinton, Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761582971?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, IOWA--The first casualty of Iowa's caucuses is former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who announced Monday night that he was dropping out of the Democratic presidential race after a disappointing showing .
Mr. O'Malley told supporters at a Des Moines bar that he was suspending a campaign that never gained traction against rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. He did not endorse either of the two.
With about 90% of the Iowa caucus results reported, Mr. O'Malley stood at less than 1%.
Flashing smiles, Mr. O'Malley said: ""When I got into this, eight months ago, I had no doubt that it would be a tough fight. And it has been a tough fight.""

Mr. Sanders, in a speech late Monday might, thanked Mr. O'Malley. ""He should know that he contributed a whole lot to the dialogue,"" the Vermont senator said.
Mr. O'Malley had sought to position himself as a liberal alternative to Mr. Sanders--a seasoned executive who had the skills to put his ideals into practice. At age 53, he also cast himself as part of a younger generation who was not part of Washington's political culture. The arguments fell flat, though, and he never came within striking distance of Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton. In national polls he never cracked an average of 5%, according to Real Clear Politics.
After Mr. O'Malley dropped out, his campaign manager, David Hamrick, sent out an email saying, ""Entering the race as an unknown, he always faced long odds--especially against a candidate as universally known as Secretary Clinton.""
Mr. O'Malley jumped in the race in May and struggled to gain name recognition or raise the money needed to be competitive. At some of his events in Iowa, people who came to see him had no idea where he was from or what offices he had held. He collected about $5 million in campaign contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By contrast, Mr. Sanders raised $20 million in the month of January alone.
When it came to policy, Mr. O'Malley had little to offer that distinguished him from his rivals. All have said they favor gun control, aggressive steps to combat global climate change and an immigration overhaul that provides undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship.
Mr. O'Malley put great stock in the Democratic debates. A fluid speaker with good looks, he hoped to turn in strong debate performances that would cause Clinton and Sanders backers to give him a fresh look. But the schedule approved by Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz did him no favors. The party set a total of only six debates and threatened to punish candidates who took part in debates that it had not sanctioned. Mr. O'Malley accused the party leadership of favoring Mrs. Clinton.
In a speech at a Democratic National Committee gathering in Minneapolis in August, he took aim at the party's decision to hold only six debates, saying, ""Whose decree is this actually? Where did it come from? To what end and what purpose? What national or party interest does this decree serve?""
(Under pressure from Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, the party now seems likely to accept more debates .)
Yet when the debates began last October, Mr. O'Malley found himself a bit player on stage. He could not match Mrs. Clinton's command of policy detail or Mr. Sanders's populist fervor.
Before the caucuses, O'Malley aides signaled that the Iowa results would determine whether he would plow forward. When Iowans gathered for the caucuses Monday night, they showed little appetite for his candidacy.
At a West Des Moines church, nearly 300 people crammed into a room that was set up to hold about half as many caucusgoers. Only five supported Mr. O'Malley; three were undecided. As the numbers were read aloud, an O'Malley supporter yelled out, ""We beat undecided!""

"Federal Lawmakers Ramp Up Response to Flint Water Crisis; House committee issues subpoenas, Democratic senators seek money, and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders plan debate in city",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762247374?accountid=12768,"Scott Calvert, Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.
WASHINGTON--Federal lawmakers Wednesday ratcheted up their response to the water crisis in Flint, Mich., as a House committee subpoenaed government officials and Democratic senators urged that money be set aside to address the problem.
The Democratic Party also said its two presidential hopefuls, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.), would hold a debate in Flint on March 6 as a way to draw attention to the contaminated-water issue.
Flint has been embroiled in a crisis for months , after the city began taking its drinking water from the Flint River, which caused lead levels to reach dangerous heights . The move was meant to be temporary as the city cut costs by switching from Detroit's water system to another water authority.
Rep. Jason Chafftez (R., Utah), chairman of the House oversight committee, said Wednesday he issued subpoenas to two officials to force them to appear at a deposition with committee lawyers regarding Flint's water crisis.

The committee had invited three officials--Miguel Del Toral, a water official at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; former EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman, who resigned Monday over the crisis; and former Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley--to testify at a hearing Wednesday. It was the first congressional hearing on the crisis since it came to national attention last fall.
The three officials declined to appear.
Nichole Distefano, an associate administrator at the EPA, told the committee in a letter last week ""it would be highly unusual for the agency to send a non-supervisory regional career staff member"" like Mr. Del Toral to testify before Congress, the letter stated, and Mr. Del Toral was focused on addressing the crisis in Flint.
The committee had invited Mr. Del Toral because he wrote a memo to EPA colleagues in June 2015 detailing the high levels of lead in Flint's drinking water. The committee accepted his decision not to testify.
However, Mr. Chaffetz said he deployed the subpoenas, which have legal force, to bring Mr. Earley and Ms. Hedman to Washington for a deposition. Whether Mr. Chaffetz would also try to compel them to appear at a public hearing hasn't been decided, according to a panel spokeswoman.
An attorney representing Mr. Earley, A. Scott Bolden, said the former emergency manager would be willing to meet with and testify before the committee ""subject to his constitutional rights and subject to any privileges he would enjoy."" Witnesses can choose to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, declining to answer questions, though Mr. Bolden didn't cite that provision in particular.
Ms. Hedman, the former EPA regional administrator for Michigan, couldn't be reached for comment.
Five other witnesses, including an official from the EPA and the director of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, testified Wednesday.
Joel Beauvais, acting deputy assistant administrator for the EPA's office of water, defended his agency's actions before the House committee and said the first responsibility for responding to the crisis fell to state and local governments.
Flint also took center stage Wednesday in the Senate debate on an energy bill, as Democrats and Republicans negotiated over a Democratic amendment providing $200 million in direct funds for Flint and as much as $600 million in loans and other financing.
""We're looking for some help from the federal government for a problem that was created by the state of Michigan and with thousands of victims,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), the second-ranking Senate Democrat.
Republicans said they were concerned about the federal government spending money to tackle a non-federal problem. The Democratic proposal ""puts the cart ahead of the horse in terms of letting local and state government address what is a local and state problem,"" said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), the second-ranking Senate Republican.
The issue has at times inflamed political sensitivities. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, has apologized for the crisis, and Democrats have cited it as evidence of GOP neglect of infrastructure and public health. Republicans have framed it as a failure of government more broadly.
At the House hearing, members of both parties chiefly criticized the state of Michigan but also chided the EPA for not responding more aggressively when Mr. Del Toral's memo pointed to high levels of lead in Flint's water.
The EPA said there is no safe level of exposure to lead, a potent neurotoxin that is especially damaging to children because it harms development of the brain and nervous system.
Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents Flint, said at the hearing that Michigan is the main culprit, calling it a ""false equivalence"" to blame city and federal officials as much as the state. ""This was a state failure,"" Mr. Kildee said.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, and two EPA divisions are among the agencies working on a broad criminal investigation into the lead contamination of Flint.

"Why Mike Bloomberg Can Win; Record numbers of voters are independents--who won't be satisfied with Clinton, Trump or Cruz.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762223569?accountid=12768,"As the results from the Iowa caucuses rolled in Monday, it became more clear than ever: If former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ran for president as an independent, he would be a serious contender for the White House. I work for Mr. Bloomberg as a pollster, and as this campaign has unfolded I have been struck by the gap between voters' concerns and how the media has portrayed them.
Talking heads say that voters are angry and polarized. This misses the mass of Americans in the middle. Only 16% of voters participated in a primary or caucus four years ago, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Even the strong turnout Monday--more than 180,000 Republicans and 170,000 Democrats--represents a mere fifth of the 1.6 million Iowans who voted in November 2012.
That's the new silent majority: the millions of Americans who don't participate in Democratic or Republican primaries. They are equally as fed up with the status quo, but they have a different approach to problem-solving and different policy prescriptions than those on the ideological extremes.
The bulk of the people who voted in Iowa were distinctively liberal or conservative. Of Republicans caucusgoers, only 14% said they were moderates, down one percentage point from 2012. Of the Democrats, 28% were moderates, down 12 points from 2008. It shows in the results: Half of the GOP caucusgoers supported either Ted Cruz, the most dogmatic conservative, or Donald Trump, the bombastic populist. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders is leading a lurch toward socialism, and Hillary Clinton is seeking to match if not exceed his leftist agenda.
Who is appealing to the center? Most Americans, the new silent majority, do not share the aims of the activist caucusgoers. The share of voters who identify as independents hit 43% last year, a new record according to Gallup . Only 26% were Republicans and 30% Democrats. Moreover, 60% of Americans told Gallup in September that the Republicans and Democrats ""do such a poor job"" representing them that they want to see a third major party emerge. That's up from 40% when the question was first asked in 2003.
Who fits the bill? Michael Bloomberg, a centrist with a clear (and arguably unique) record in business as an entrepreneur and in politics as a three-term mayor of New York. Mr. Bloomberg is a fiscally prudent conciliator who advances pro-growth policies and takes tough stands. He supports comprehensive immigration reform to strengthen the American economy, environmental protections to protect our planet for the next generation, and social policies to promote inclusiveness, public health and community safety. In short, his agenda is very different from what is being offered by Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio or Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.
As America becomes more polarized, the desire grows for a candidate in the center focused on building consensus and getting results. This is the hidden message of Monday's caucuses, the one that Mr. Bloomberg is contemplating as he considers a run for president.
The numbers bear this out: Shortly after the 2014 election a poll by this newspaper and NBC News showed that 63% of Americans favored compromise, not confrontation, to achieve policy goals. A majority, 52%, wanted the government to do more problem-solving. These attitudes suggest a constituency for a candidate who eschews partisanship and produces results. That's exactly what Mr. Bloomberg did in New York, and what he has advocated for 10 years in speeches on reforming the political system and fixing Washington.
A January poll by Frank Luntz--which was not commissioned by Mr. Bloomberg or me--illustrates the mayor's potential. Mr. Luntz, who advised Ross Perot's independent bid in 1992, found that 84% of voters could support a generic candidate who matches Mr. Bloomberg's profile. When asked about the former mayor by name, 55% said they would consider supporting him. That includes 57% of Democrats, 45% of Republicans, and 62% of swing voters.
In direct matchups--three-way races against Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Cruz, or Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Rubio--the poll puts Mr. Bloomberg at 28%, and the election almost within the margin of error. And that's before he has announced a candidacy or run a single ad.
In short, the Bloomberg message would be unique in a year when Republicans have moved sharply to the right, and Democrats sharply to the left. The Luntz survey shows that more than a third of voters, 35%, either have no opinion about Mr. Bloomberg or have never heard of him. That gives him huge potential for growth among voters who are disappointed and dissatisfied with the two major parties.
The past two independents to begin presidential candidacies from the center were not successful. In 1992 Mr. Perot went as high as 37% in the polls, but finished with 19% of the popular vote. In 1980 John Anderson hit the mid-20s, but then stalled and won only 7% on Election Day. But their candidacies were sunk by poor temperament, meager resources or an inability to get on the ballot. Mr. Bloomberg would have none of those problems.
Commentators have mistakenly characterized Mr. Bloomberg's mayoral tenure as exclusively focused on a relatively limited (but widely known) social and public health agenda, including laws to prevent gun violence and discourage smoking. They're missing the bigger picture. Over more than a decade in office Mr. Bloomberg governed with (and articulated) sensible alternatives on reforming taxes and government services, as well as revitalizing the economy. He kept New York safe from a terrorist attack for 12 years and stood firm with law enforcement to reduce crime by 32% and make it the safest big city in the nation.
A Bloomberg candidacy would make no effort to kowtow to the religious right or labor unions. Mr. Bloomberg would not and has never made deals with special interests. Because he has always been able to finance his campaigns himself, his independence is indisputable.
As this politically frenetic February wears on, the primary process will demonstrate to voters how divided and dysfunctional the nation has become. For Americans in the middle, a Mike Bloomberg candidacy will become more compelling by the day.
Mr. Schoen served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton and has advised Michael Bloomberg since 2001.

Clinton's U.N. Candidate? The favorite to run Turtle Bay is Russia's preferred choice.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763236911?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton has made gender a major part of her pitch for the White House, and the idea is catching on. A leading candidate to become the next Secretary-General of the United Nations is a Bulgarian woman with a Communist past and a record unfriendly to U.S. interests who is being promoted by Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law.
The Bulgarian is 63-year-old Irina Bokova, who since 2009 has run Unesco, the U.N. cultural and social welfare agency. By tradition the top job at the U.N., Secretary-General, rotates by region and it will be Eastern Europe's turn when Ban Ki-moon's term expires at the end of this year. The Bulgarian government may nominate her for the post, which given her U.N. experience would make her the favorite unless significant opposition develops.
Ms. Bokova deserves more scrutiny, not least because of her record at Unesco. Long-time Journal readers will recall that the U.S. withdrew from Unesco in 1984 after years of anti-American agitation. The U.S. rejoined in 2003 saying the agency had reformed.
But in 2011 under Ms. Bokova, Unesco tried to make an end run around the Middle East peace process by admitting the Palestinian Authority as a member state despite U.S. objections. Mrs. Clinton's State Department was then forced by U.S. law to cut off the roughly $80 million in annual U.S. funding for Unesco.
That law reflects Congress's view that U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state before there is a peace deal with Israel encourages the Palestinians to avoid direct negotiations. The cutoff probably stopped other U.N. agencies from recognizing a Palestinian state lest they also lose U.S. funds. But President Obama opposes the funding cutoff and in December asked Congress to reconsider. It declined.
We can't find a record of Mrs. Clinton's views on Unesco funding, but she's no doubt aware of Ms. Bokova, who has participated in Clinton Global Initiative events. Ms. Bokova is also friendly with women's-rights activist Marjorie Margolies, a former Democratic Member of Congress who is a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government--and Chelsea's mother-in-law. On Tuesday after Ms. Bokova delivers a lecture at the Fels Institute, she and Ms. Margolies will share a stage for a ""conversation"" and ""Q&A"" with the audience.
The following day former Ambassador Esther Coopersmith will host a dinner for Ms. Bokova in Washington ""to learn more about her candidacy for Secretary General of the United Nations,"" as the invitation puts it. Washingtonian magazine reported in December 2013 that Ms. Coopersmith ""is close to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.""
The Economist reports that Ms. Bokova is also ""Russia's preferred candidate."" Last year she attended Vladimir Putin's Moscow Victory Day Parade, the biggest military display in Russian history. Most Western leaders refused to attend Mr. Putin's extravaganza in protest over his depredations in Ukraine. But Ms. Bokova was on hand with the likes of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Cuba's Raul Castro.
Ms. Bokova was an active member of the Bulgarian Communist Party in the Cold War era, and her father edited the Party's house organ. She graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1976 when talented students were dispatched to the institute to become good Communist diplomats. And she remained a member of the Communist Party until it changed its name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party.
It's true that the Cold War ended long ago, and many former Communists in the former Warsaw Pact have become democrats in good standing. But authoritarians are again on the march in the world, Mr. Putin chief among them. As U.N. Secretary-General, Ms. Bokova would have global influence and could create trouble for the U.S. All the more so in a Hillary Clinton Administration that would want U.N. approval and consensus for its diplomatic undertakings.
If the next Secretary-General must be a woman from Eastern Europe, there is a better alternative. Kristalina Georgieva is currently a vice president at the European Commission and has worked at the World Bank. Though she isn't our ideal candidate--her fans include George Soros--she lacks Ms. Bokova's political baggage. The current center-right government in Sofia might nominate Ms. Georgieva if there's global opposition to Ms. Bokova.
The U.S. role is crucial here. No Secretary-General is likely to be approved if America is actively opposed. Mr. Obama is leaving town in 11 months, and the next President will need a U.N. leader who isn't hostile to American interests. We'd like to know where Mrs. Clinton stands on Ms. Bokova's candidacy, and the House and Senate may want to examine her record in Bulgaria and at Unesco.",2016-02-09
The Myths of Black Lives Matter; The movement has won over Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But what if its claims are fiction?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764468074?accountid=12768,"A television ad for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign now airing in South Carolina shows the candidate declaring that ""too many encounters with law enforcement end tragically."" She later adds: ""We have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism.""
Her Democratic presidential rival, Bernie Sanders, met with the Rev. Al Sharpton on Wednesday. Mr. Sanders then tweeted that ""As President, let me be very clear that no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will."" And he appeared on the TV talk show ""The View"" saying, ""It is not acceptable to see unarmed people being shot by police officers.""
Apparently the Black Lives Matter movement has convinced Democrats and progressives that there is an epidemic of racist white police officers killing young black men. Such rhetoric is going to heat up as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders court minority voters before the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary.
But what if the Black Lives Matter movement is based on fiction? Not just the fictional account of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., but the utter misrepresentation of police shootings generally.
To judge from Black Lives Matter protesters and their media and political allies, you would think that killer cops pose the biggest threat to young black men today. But this perception, like almost everything else that many people think they know about fatal police shootings, is wrong.
The Washington Post has been gathering data on fatal police shootings over the past year and a half to correct acknowledged deficiencies in federal tallies. The emerging data should open many eyes.
For starters, fatal police shootings make up a much larger proportion of white and Hispanic homicide deaths than black homicide deaths. According to the Post database, in 2015 officers killed 662 whites and Hispanics, and 258 blacks. (The overwhelming majority of all those police-shooting victims were attacking the officer, often with a gun.) Using the 2014 homicide numbers as an approximation of 2015's, those 662 white and Hispanic victims of police shootings would make up 12% of all white and Hispanic homicide deaths. That is three times the proportion of black deaths that result from police shootings.
The lower proportion of black deaths due to police shootings can be attributed to the lamentable black-on-black homicide rate. There were 6,095 black homicide deaths in 2014--the most recent year for which such data are available--compared with 5,397 homicide deaths for whites and Hispanics combined. Almost all of those black homicide victims had black killers.
Police officers--of all races--are also disproportionately endangered by black assailants. Over the past decade, according to FBI data, 40% of cop killers have been black. Officers are killed by blacks at a rate 2.5 times higher than the rate at which blacks are killed by police.
Some may find evidence of police bias in the fact that blacks make up 26% of the police-shooting victims, compared with their 13% representation in the national population. But as residents of poor black neighborhoods know too well, violent crimes are disproportionately committed by blacks. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, though they made up roughly 15% of the population there.
Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities, raising officers' own risk of using lethal force.
The Black Lives Matter movement claims that white officers are especially prone to shooting innocent blacks due to racial bias, but this too is a myth. A March 2015 Justice Department report on the Philadelphia Police Department found that black and Hispanic officers were much more likely than white officers to shoot blacks based on ""threat misperception""--that is, the mistaken belief that a civilian is armed.
A 2015 study by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Greg Ridgeway, formerly acting director of the National Institute of Justice, found that, at a crime scene where gunfire is involved, black officers in the New York City Police Department were 3.3 times more likely to discharge their weapons than other officers at the scene.
The Black Lives Matter movement has been stunningly successful in changing the subject from the realities of violent crime. The world knows the name of Michael Brown but not Tyshawn Lee, a 9-year-old black child lured into an alley and killed by gang members in Chicago last fall. Tyshawn was one of dozens of black children gunned down in America last year. The Baltimore Sun reported on Jan. 1: ""Blood was shed in Baltimore at an unprecedented pace in 2015, with mostly young, black men shot to death in a near-daily crush of violence.""
Those were black lives that mattered, and it is a scandal that outrage is heaped less on the dysfunctional culture that produces so many victims than on the police officers who try to protect them.

Bernie Sanders's Path to Democratic Nomination Impeded by Nevada Result; Vermont senator looks forward to Super Tuesday contests on March 1 as next best chance for a victory against rival Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766825575?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS--Sen. Bernie Sanders's path ahead in the Democratic presidential primary was already challenging, and it was made more so by his defeat Saturday in the Nevada caucuses.
Hillary Clinton now claims victory in two of the first three contests , and she's favored to win the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary, too. Mr. Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary, won't see his next best chance for a second victory until March 1, when 11 states host primaries and caucuses.
In his remarks in Nevada, Mr. Sanders briefly noted that he's traveling to South Carolina on Sunday, but then he quickly pivoted to the next round of primaries with nearly 900 delegates up for grabs.
""We're going to be competing in 11 states all across this country on Super Tuesday,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""And I believe that on Super Tuesday, we have got an excellent chance to win many of those states.""
On Monday, he will go to Massachusetts and on Tuesday he goes to Virginia, both contests that will follow South Carolina.
His campaign is already running paid TV ads in Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma, as well as Massachusetts, four states where advisers see their best chances for victory. Minnesota and Colorado are caucus states, which tend to attract the more liberal voters that he appeals to, his advisers said.

Mr. Sanders also holds a huge advantage in his home state of Vermont, another March 1 state.
Also voting the same day are Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Arkansas, all contests that will feature a significant number of African-American voters. That should provide an advantage to Mrs. Clinton, whose support in the black community was reaffirmed in Nevada, where entrance polls showed three-fourths of African-Americans backed her. She's expected to see similar support in South Carolina.
Mr. Sanders's campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Saturday that the campaign will compete in the Palmetto State even though they know the Vermont senator is the underdog. ""We're going to go down and we're going to fight in South Carolina. It's obviously an uphill fight for us there,"" he said. ""Then we're going to go to Super Tuesday.""
After that, the Sanders campaign sees potential victories on March 5 in Kansas and Nebraska and on March 6 in Maine--all three caucus states. Sanders aides are also focused on the big prize of Michigan, where a primary is set for March 8. Mr. Weaver referred to the contest there as a ""a big showdown.""
Mr. Weaver also noted that under Democratic Party rules, delegates are allocated proportionately, meaning that if a race is close, both candidates win substantial delegates.
There are no winner-take-all states in the Democratic primary race, which prevents one candidate from pulling far away from a competitor. At the same time, though, this system makes it very hard to catch up once a candidate falls behind.
When challengers are forced to drop out, it is usually because they run out of money, and Mr. Sanders shows no signs of that. He collected more than $6 million in the 24 hours after winning the New Hampshire primary. On Saturday, the Vermont senator asked his backers to continue to lend their financial support, saying that ""taking on the establishment"" isn't easy.
Still, he'll need to notch some quick wins if he is to seriously threaten Mrs. Clinton. ""He has the money and resources to keep going, but he needed Nevada to fuel his momentum because he will lose South Carolina,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist who is neutral in the race.
""Realistically, this hill became very high to climb,"" Mr. Kofinis said. ""Short of a stunning loss [by Mrs. Clinton] on Super Tuesday, we're seeing the limits of his candidacy.""

"Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Seize Leads for Their Parties' Nominations; Weekend wins give both candidates the upper hand in amassing delegates in next state contests",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766924120?accountid=12768,"PAHRUMP, Nev.--Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton emerged from a weekend of voting as the clear leaders in the fight for their parties' presidential nominations, with smoother potential paths to victory than seemed likely a few weeks ago.
After winning the South Carolina primary , Mr. Trump should continue to benefit from a splintered Republican field that allows him to rack up convention delegates elsewhere in the South. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton's win in Nevada's caucuses has helped dispel doubts about her candidacy just as it heads on to favorable turf in the South, where she always figured to be stronger than her competitor Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Both front-runners still face obstacles. Mr. Trump may soon be hit with more direct attacks, and, as the field winnows, a pair of winner-take-all primaries in March could allow a competitor to make up ground quickly. And Mrs. Clinton faces a rival who has a fervent base of support in some states that lie ahead, while she has lower levels of support than her campaign would like in some pockets of the Democratic electorate.
In the short term, though, both will benefit from a primary map that is likely to give them some running room in the delegate hunt.
Mr. Trump is expected to win Nevada's Tuesday caucuses, and the state's 30 delegates, and then 12 states vote on Super Tuesday, March 1. Seven of those states are Southern contests that are key to Sen. Ted Cruz's path to victory. But Mr. Trump's convincing victory in South Carolina has put the Texan's proposition that he will be the choice of the region's social conservatives on shaky ground.
A total of 989 Republican delegates are at stake between March 1 and March 12, to be awarded proportionally, giving Mr. Trump a chance to build a significant advantage before the start of the winner-take-all primaries March 15. A total of 1,237 delegates are needed to secure the GOP nomination.
""If Trump can't be stopped from taking a majority of Super Tuesday delegates it's hard to see how he's not going to be the nominee,"" said Walker Stapleton, the Colorado state treasurer who was co-chairman of Jeb Bush's campaign in Colorado. The former Florida governor dropped out of the race Saturday after a poor showing in South Carolina.
A string of losses in the Southern states could be debilitating to Mr. Cruz, the Iowa caucus winner who is jockeying with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to become the primary alternative to Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubio took second place in South Carolina but is under growing pressure to show he can win a state. His home turf, Florida, holds a winner-take-all contest on March 15.
Speaking to reporters here Sunday, Mr. Cruz predicted he would defeat Mr. Trump in a one-on-one matchup should the party choose him as the alternative to the businessman.
""Donald Trump has demonstrated that he has a relatively high floor of support, but he's also got, I think, a ceiling,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""You've got nearly 70% of Republican primary voters that don't believe Donald is the right person to represent our party in the general election against Hillary Clinton.""
Lying in wait outside of the South is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished in fifth place in South Carolina with less than 8% support after his surprise second-place showing in New Hampshire. His campaign is working Massachusetts, another March 1 state, and will need a strong showing in the March 8 Michigan primary to justify his candidacy.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson took sixth in South Carolina but is remaining in the race.
The longer the non-Trump vote is divided four ways, or even split between two candidates, the more delegates Mr. Trump will collect by winning with a plurality of the primary votes rather than a majority.
Beyond the map, the rhetoric on the campaign trail has leaned Mr. Trump's way, with most rivals avoiding attacking him so as not to draw his fire.
It is a stark difference from 2012, when after Newt Gingrich won South Carolina's primary, the rival Mitt Romney campaign launched a full-scale effort to take down the former House speaker in Florida, the next voting state. Romney surrogates, such as Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, trailed Mr. Gingrich at his events and attacked his record to reporters while the campaign and supportive super PAC peppered the airwaves with TV ads hitting Mr. Gingrich.
No campaign has even attempted anything similar to attack Mr. Trump. Mr. Gingrich said Sunday it probably wouldn't work anyway.
""You can't have the Romney effect this year,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Nobody can raise enough money, and furthermore, we don't know of any message that works"" against Mr. Trump.
Of the roughly $215 million that super PACs have spent so far on advertisements, phone calls and mailers promoting or attacking candidates of both parties, just about $9 million--or 4%--has been spent opposing Mr. Trump, who has been leading national polls since July.
The biggest hit was from Our Principles PAC, a group created by a former aide to Mr. Romney's 2012 campaign. The group has spent about $3.8 million so far attacking Mr. Trump, though $3 million of its fundraising has come from just two donors: Marlene Ricketts, the wife of TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, and Wisconsin shipping executive Richard Uihlein, according to the latest campaign-finance reports.
Mr. Chaffetz, who now backs Mr. Rubio, arrived in Nevada on Sunday. But he has no plans to attend Mr. Trump's Las Vegas rally Monday.
Instead, the House Oversight Committee chairman drove an hour to Pahrump, a retirement community near the California border, to ""provide oversight"" for Mr. Cruz outside a sports bar, where the Texan appeared for a rally.
Asked why he isn't trying to distract the front-runner, Mr. Chaffetz replied, ""I don't even know if that's possible with Mr. Trump....If you're a Trump fan, you're a Trump fan.""
Clinton campaign officials, for their part, believe the Nevada victory bodes well for the racially diverse set of states that come up next on the calendar.
""Nevada posed the first test for both campaigns in a diverse state--the first test of whether Sen. Sanders could broaden his appeal....And he came up short,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said.
Mr. Sanders said on CNN Sunday that his campaign is gaining support among Hispanic voters. ""I think our message is resonating,"" he said.
Delegates are awarded proportionally in the Democratic nomination fight, making it hard for one candidate to clinch the nomination early. But Clinton campaign aides, buoyed by the caucus win, are convinced the former senator and secretary of state is on a path to roll up an insurmountable lead by the end of March, meaning the Vermont senator would be hard-pressed to overtake her even if he notches victories in the spring.
Mrs. Clinton also already has a big lead among superdelegates, a group of Democratic Party officials who will make up about 30% of the total needed to win.
One of Mr. Sanders's strengths had appeared to be states that hold caucuses, which typically inspire candidacies that fire up party activists, rather than primaries. Yet with three contests in the books, Mrs. Clinton has won the two caucus states.
That record is making Clinton aides confident about her prospects.
""When they articulate their path, when they talk about how they're going to compete for the nomination, they talk about caucus states. We're now 2-0 in caucus states,"" Mr. Fallon said.

Schlesinger's Take: Gensler's Ghost Over CFTC; Hillary Clinton Takes Stand on 'Position Limits for Commodities Markets',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768548633?accountid=12768,"It's not often a presidential candidate takes a stand on ""position limits for commodities markets."" But Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's campaign released Thursday a statement saying she ""believes these limits are a critical tool in curbing excessive speculation...""
The quote was attributed to campaign CFO Gary Gensler. He was, in an earlier incarnation, the top regulator driving - over strong objections from financial and energy firms - the position limits as tools to combat potential price spikes in oil and other commodities.
Mr. Gensler's remarks served not just as pushback to opponents making a renewed bid to block the rule, but a prod to his successor as head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Timothy Massad. Mr. Massad has been slow to complete the regulation Mr. Gensler rushed to propose before leaving the commission in early 2014. Two years later, the rule is still grinding its way through the CFTC process.
It has become a symbol of Mr. Massad's more deliberative, consultative manner, compared with Mr. Gensler's frenetic pace and style often seen as confrontational toward Wall Street. It's a contrast that has, at times, mollified the financial industry and frustrated its critics.
The position-limits rule has a controversial history. While authorized by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act responding to the 2008 financial crisis, it has little to do with problems exposed during that meltdown. Rather, it was inspired by the oil-price spikes that same year, which some analysts attributed to dodgy speculators. The law allowed the CFTC to expand its longstanding powers to limit the number of futures and swaps contracts a trader can hold, beyond agricultural commodities to include energy and other sectors.
Mr. Gensler first issued the rule in 2011, but was forced back to the drawing board after opponents persuaded a federal judge to toss out his original draft.
The urgency also seemed to recede when oil prices plunged from the 2008 $100-a-barrel-plus peak to $30 this year.
Mr. Massad backs the position limits rule as well, and he joined Mr. Gensler Thursday in blasting a report released by a CFTC advisory committee, dominated by industry representatives, which concluded the rules were ""not demonstrably necessary.""
""It strikes me a bit like saying you're against speed limits because they may make you late for work,"" Mr. Massad sarcastically told a panel meeting as he rejected their findings.
But Mr. Massad hasn't offered a timetable for completing the regulation and putting it to a vote before his divided commission. He has said he's been taking his time in order to best calibrate it, incorporating what he considers the constructive suggestions from critics.
Yet if Mr. Massad doesn't push for finalization soon, the effective date could spill past President Barack Obama's term - leaving it vulnerable to being blocked by the next president, should Mr. Gensler's boss fail to win that slot.

Justice and Clinton's Email Probe; A 'career' official doesn't guarantee an honest investigation.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768057879?accountid=12768,"Attorney General Loretta Lynch this week tried to assure House Republicans about the impartiality of her department's investigation into Hillary Clinton's State Department emails by noting that it would be handled by career government officials. This claim could stand a little parsing.
The probe into her possible mishandling of classified information ""is being handled by career independent law enforcement agents--FBI agents--as well as the career independent attorneys in the Department of Justice,"" Ms. Lynch said Wednesday. ""They follow the evidence, they look at the law and they'll make a recommendation to me when the time is appropriate,"" adding that the probe is being ""conducted as every other case.""
That's what they always say, and it is nice to think so. But there's reason to doubt given the example of Justice's investigation into the IRS targeting of conservative groups before the 2012 election. To lead that probe, then Attorney General Eric Holder appointed Barbara Bosserman, a trial attorney in the department's Civil Rights Division.
Ms. Bosserman's appointment was curious given that her area of expertise is civil rights, not tax law. She had also donated $6,100 to President Obama's campaigns and the Obama Victory Fund in 2008 and 2012. That's no small donation on a career employee's salary and suggests some serious political loyalty.
Ms. Bosserman's conflict of interest came to light only after Justice stonewalled congressional requests for information about the status of the IRS probe. The House Oversight Committee then began investigating Justice's investigation. In September 2014 we wrote about the involvement of former department spokesman Brian Fallon , now a press secretary for the Clinton presidential campaign.
The House also discovered that Justice had assigned former IRS tax attorney Andrew Strelka to the case brought against the agency by Z Street, a pro-Israel group that claimed its tax-exempt status had been delayed because of its political leanings. Mr. Strelka had previously served as a presidential management fellow working in the IRS tax-exempt office managed by Lois Lerner, who by the way was also a career government official with clear anti-Republican political leanings. Mr. Strelka was removed from the case before being deposed as a witness.
Justice closed its investigation of the IRS last October with no criminal charges.
We'll hope for the best from Ms. Lynch's career prosecutors, and especially from the FBI. But whoever handles the case, at either the State or Justice Department, will presumably create a paper trail of evidence and legal analysis. If a Republican wins the presidential election, his appointees will be able to look at the files and judge the evidence independently.",2016-03-02
Valeant CEO Races to Repair Drug Maker's Reputation; Pearson Holds One-on-One Sessions With Supportive Analysts; Company Challenges Clinton Campaign Ad,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769102822?accountid=12768,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Chief Executive Michael Pearson just got back from a two-month sick leave, and immediately faced a fresh round of criticism and doubts about the company's financial disclosures and business practices.
In response, Mr. Pearson spoke with a select group of Wall Street analysts. In one-on-one calls Tuesday with some who have generally stuck by the drug company, Mr. Pearson indicated he was bullish about Valeant's prospects and predicted performance not too far off what the company had initially forecast, but later took back, according to the analysts.
The company also challenged a new television ad from Hillary Clinton's campaign, in which the Democratic presidential candidate said she was ""going after"" Valeant for what she called ""predatory pricing"" of one of its migraine drugs.
Valeant posted a rebuttal on its website, saying a patient cited in Ms. Clinton's ad doesn't face ""significant"" out-of-pocket costs for the drug, and that low-cost generics far outsell the Valeant product, which has just $1 million in yearly sales. The company declined further comment.
Once a high-flying stock, Valeant has lost about three-quarters of its value since peaking last summer, as it met with questions about its business practices and disclosures of government investigations.
The drug maker became a poster child for criticism of high drug prices, and a target of congressional inquiries, after The Wall Street Journal reported Valeant was buying the rights to certain treatments and quickly raising their prices by substantial amounts.
Amid the controversies, Mr. Pearson had to step away from the company late last year to be treated for a case of severe pneumonia. The company announced his return on Sunday.
The CEO's outreach efforts on the company's behalf seemed to have had an impact; shares in Valeant, which plunged 18% Monday, recovered from a further drop in early trading Tuesday and finished the day only modestly lower at $65.45.
But even some supportive analysts have criticized what they call an information vacuum around the company.
Valeant previously withdrew its financial guidance for this year, and said it needed to restate some earnings after a board committee's probe of the company's relationship with a mail-order pharmacy found Valeant booked $58 million in revenue too early.
Late Monday, Valeant said it would miss an extended government deadline this month for reporting its annual performance.
Valeant is a ""black box at this point in time,"" said Jefferies analyst David Steinberg, who kept his buy rating on Valeant, saying it has some strong brands in gastroenterology and eye health, but he cut his price target for the company's stock on Tuesday to $106 from $172.
Mr. Steinberg said a big question for the company involved a key product: toenail-fungus treatment Jublia. He said he couldn't estimate how Jublia would do in 2016 without more information on how Valeant will divvy up revenues with Walgreens Boots Alliance pharmacies, which recently agreed to replace mail-order pharmacy Philidor Rx Services LLC and help fill prescriptions.
""We have no information on the terms of the collaboration between Valeant and Walgreens,"" Mr. Steinberg said. Mr. Steinberg said he wasn't one of the analysts who spoke with Mr. Pearson on Tuesday.
Valeant's talking only with select analysts ""isn't per se a problem,"" said Jill Fisch, a law professor and corporate-governance expert at the University of Pennsylvania.
If Mr. Pearson discussed significant information with the analysts that the public doesn't know about, ""that would be a concern,"" Ms. Fisch said. But if he simply wanted to touch base as he returns to Valeant and help analysts get comfortable with the flood of news Valeant has put out over the past two days, ""that's probably OK,"" she said.
Companies are barred from selectively disclosing material information to analysts or big investors without disclosing it to everyone, under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation FD. But one-on-one analyst calls are generally permitted as long as executives don't reveal anything significant that hasn't been made public.
The analysts who spoke with Mr. Pearson said afterward in notes or calls with investors that they ultimately expect Valeant to lower its guidance. But they said talking with Mr. Pearson left them with the impression that there were no more major surprises in store for investors.
Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat told investors in a Webcast that he expects Valeant to give guidance in the next one to two weeks, and that it wouldn't be much different from what the company had provided earlier.
Shibani Malhotra from Nomura Securities said she expects the company's forecast to be lowered slightly due to the stronger dollar, the weaker-than-expected performance of its new female-libido drug Addyi, and certain businesses that may not have performed as well as expected.
""Nothing we heard changes our positive view,"" UBS Group AG's Marc Goodman said in a note.
Still, Valeant faces some serious challenges to its business. Moody's Investors Service is reviewing Valeant's credit rating for a possible downgrade, saying its operating performance was worse than expected and could hurt its ability to lower its debt, which stood at $31 billion at the end of September.
Drug-benefit managers like Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health Corp., which play key roles paying for prescriptions, have said they are reviewing Valeant's often-costly medicines. Decisions to block coverage of Valeant drugs could damp sales.
And Valeant is facing serious threats to inflammatory-bowel-disease drug Xifaxan, which it is counting on for sales growth. Rival Allergan Inc. is selling a competing drug called Viberzi, and has asked the Food and Drug Administration to let it sell a generic version of Xifaxan.

Front-Runners' Wins in Virginia on Super Tuesday Point a Way Forward; Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton show they can forge needed voter coalitions in diverse swing state,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769071445?accountid=12768,"Of all their primary victories Tuesday, the wins by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Virginia did the most to show they can forge the voter coalitions needed to win their party's presidential nominations.
Racially diverse, with big, urban centers and a large share of college graduates, Virginia stood as a proving ground for candidates in both parties as the nomination races move in coming weeks to other large, diverse states, including Ohio and Florida.
The parties' two front-runners won the state in different ways: Mrs. Clinton expanded the coalition she had built in earlier contests; Mr. Trump, while showing growing support among some voter groups, won in large part due to greater intensity among voter groups who were already part of his natural base.
Coming in the largest presidential swing state to vote so far, the two paths to victory give clues to the coalitions each candidate might try to form as a party nominee.
Mr. Trump has built a dominating position in the presidential race by carrying lower-income voters and those without a four-year college degree. In Virginia, he won those groups with larger margins than he had in prior contests, preliminary exit poll results reported by various media show.
Mr. Trump carried a remarkable 52% of voters with household income under $50,000, a far larger share than in his victories in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. He won 44% of voters without a college degree--a larger share than in three of the four contests before Super Tuesday. Those voter groups remain the pillars of his candidacy.
At the same time, Mr. Trump was able to deprive Sen. Marco Rubio, his top rival in the state, of big margins among his own natural base, including college graduates and voters with the highest incomes. Mr. Rubio won those groups--but not by the vote totals needed to overcome the bounding support Mr. Trump enjoyed among his own core groups. With almost all precincts reporting, Mr. Trump edged Mr. Rubio in the state, 35% to 32%.
Mr. Trump's coalition took on different contours that suggest growing acceptance by some parts of the party and hesitancy among others after weeks of a coarsening nomination battle. Mr. Trump's share of self-described moderate voters in Virginia was lower by far than in any prior contest. He carried only 23% of that group, exit polls reported by media showed, compared to about one-third of voters in three prior contests and 55% in the Nevada caucuses.
At the same time, he won a larger share of evangelical Christians than in any prior contest but one.
Mrs. Clinton, in contrast to Mr. Trump, expanded the coalition she had built in prior contests.
She carried 58% of white voters, preliminary exit poll results showed, compared to 54% in last weekend's South Carolina primary. Mrs. Clinton had lost white voters to Sen. Bernie Sanders in the course of winning the Nevada caucuses. With almost all precincts reporting, Mrs. Clinton won Virginia with 64% to Mr. Sanders's 35%.
At the same time, Mrs. Clinton reduced Mr. Sanders's margins among younger voters, and he carried only 52% of voters younger than age 45, exit polls showed. That was a far smaller share than the 74% Mr. Sanders won during his landslide victory last month in New Hampshire.
Mr. Sanders won only 36% of voters without a four-year college degree, a group he had carried in some prior contests.
Mr. Trump's working-class coalition held together in many other states. In Arkansas, he won Republican voters with household income under $50,000 while losing higher-income voters to Sen. Ted Cruz. Similarly, he won Arkansas Republicans who don't have a college degree, while losing college graduates to Messrs. Cruz and Rubio.
Mr. Trump also lost among Republicans with a college degree in Vermont, while winning those without a degree.
Voters who went to the polls Tuesday also reflected the nation's widening partisan divide: Republicans in many states leaned more conservative than in their last competitive primaries, while Democrats were more liberal.
In Tennessee, for example, 83% of GOP voters rated themselves as conservative, compared with 73% who said so in 2012.
By contrast, the Democratic voter pool in Virginia was more liberal than during the party's last contested primary, in 2008. Some 68% of Virginia Democrats who voted on Tuesday called themselves liberal, the preliminary exit poll results showed, compared with 50% in 2008. The share of self-described moderates fell nine percentage points to 29%.

With more than half of the vote counted, Mr. Cruz, of Texas, had 49% of the vote, versus 25% for Mr. Trump, according to the Associated Press. Sen. Marco Rubio had nearly 15% of the vote, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich had nearly 10%.
Kansas allocates its 40 convention delegates on a proportional basis to candidates who earn at least 10%.
The state, one of four to vote in the Republican contests on Saturday, was expected to be favorable ground for Mr. Cruz because evangelicals make up about one-third of the total population. In past GOP nominating contests, the state has gone with the evangelical favorite--former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum in 2012 and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in 2008.
Mr. Cruz had made Kansas his first campaign destination after the Super Tuesday contests, making two stops in the state Wednesday. Both he and Mr. Trump made a last-minute pitch for the Kansas contest with appearances in Wichita on Saturday.
A poll of Kansas Republicans released a week ago by Fort Hays State University had shown Mr. Trump in the lead with 26%, followed by Mr. Cruz with 14%.
Mr. Rubio, in Kansas as in other states, had drawn endorsements from top GOP luminaries including Gov. Sam Brownback, Sen. Pat Roberts and Rep. Mike Pompeo. Mr. Cruz was endorsed by conservative Rep. Tim Huelskamp. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach endorsed Mr. Trump.

Elsewhere on Saturday, Republicans in Kentucky and Maine were gathering for caucuses, while Louisiana was holding its presidential primary.
Democrats, meanwhile, were voting in three states Saturday--Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska--as front-runner Hillary Clinton seeks to widen her delegate lead over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
For Republican challengers still hoping to block the party's front-runner, every state affords an opportunity to keep delegates out of the hands of Mr. Trump because the states aren't winner-take-all contests.
What is more, these states give the businessman's more-experienced competitors an advantage because they are Republican-only nominating contests: Much of Mr. Trump's support has come from unaffiliated voters in states like New Hampshire where non-Republicans can vote in the primary.
Here is a look at the other Saturday states:
Maine
With 5% of the vote counted from the state's caucuses, Mr. Cruz was leading here also, with 48%, compared with 35% for Mr. Trump. The state is awarding 23 delegates; If a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, he will win them all. Otherwise, delegates will be awarded proportionately to candidates who get at least 10%.
There is no public polling to gauge the race. Mr. Trump took a detour to hold a big rally in Portland Thursday, on route from Florida to Detroit for the GOP candidate debate . He has enjoyed the support of Maine Gov. Paul LePage. Mr. Cruz held a rally in Bangor Friday morning.
Democrats meet in their caucuses Sunday, and Mr. Sanders is hoping for a strong showing there in a state that is neighbor to his home state of Vermont and borders New Hampshire, where he won his biggest victory over Mrs. Clinton.
Kentucky
Kentucky Republicans for the first time are holding presidential caucuses rather than a primary--a change that had been made to help favorite son Sen. Rand Paul in his presidential bid, but he has since dropped out.
The state awards delegates proportionately, but only to candidates who earn at least 5% of the vote.
Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn't endorsed a candidate, but has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump and repeatedly at odds in the Senate with Mr. Cruz, who once called Mr. McConnell a liar for his handling of Export-Import Bank legislation opposed by conservatives.
A recent Big Red Poll by Western Kentucky University found Mr. Trump leading with 35% of likely caucus participants, followed by Mr. Rubio with 22%, Mr. Cruz with 15%, and Mr. Kasich with 6%. Some 15% of likely caucus participants indicated they were still undecided.
Mr. Trump held a rally in Louisville earlier this week, an event that was marred by violence between black protesters and Trump supporters.
Democrats won't hold their nominating contest until May 17, when the state holds its primary election.
Louisiana
Both parties are holding primary elections in the state, which awards 46 Republican delegates and 51 Democratic delegates. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have a chance to repeat big victories they have had in other Southern states.
The two front-runners held rallies in Louisiana Friday night. A recent poll by the Trafalgar Group found that Mr. Trump has a solid lead in Louisiana, like other Deep South states he swept on Super Tuesday. Mr. Trump led with 44%, followed by Mr. Cruz with 26%, Mr. Rubio with 15% and Mr. Kasich with 5%.
On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton is the front-runner, building another victory on the strength of support among African-American voters. A recent Magellan Strategies poll gave her a lead of 61% to 14% over Mr. Sanders.
Nebraska
The Nebraska Democratic caucus will award 25 delegates on a proportionate basis. Sanders supporters are hoping the state will go the way of Oklahoma, which favored the senator in its Super Tuesday primary. He spoke to a packed crowd on a college campus in Lincoln Thursday.
Mrs. Clinton hasn't appeared in the state since December, but former President Bill Clinton held campaign appearances for her in Omaha and Lincoln on Friday.

Fed Governor Brainard Donated to Clinton Campaign; Official made three contributions totaling $750 between mid-November and mid-January,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771263795?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--A Federal Reserve governor donated to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in recent months, a rare sign of political favor by a member of the central bank's powerful board.
Lael Brainard, who was nominated to the board by President Barack Obama, made three contributions totaling $750 between mid-November and mid-January, according to Federal Election Commission records. The donations were earlier reported by Bloomberg News.
The contributions didn't violate any central-bank rules, a Fed spokeswoman said. Fed board members can make campaign donations but are barred from engaging in partisan political activities, in line with rules that apply to the executive branch. When asked if Ms. Brainard would comment, a Fed spokesman said, ""We have nothing more for you.""
News of the donations to the leading Democratic presidential candidate follows Republican lawmakers' complaints last year that Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen had politicized the central bank by meeting more with Obama administration officials, Democrats and liberal advocacy groups--allegations she rejected.
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) on Tuesday bemoaned the Fed's ""exceedingly close relationship"" with the White House, adding that Ms. Brainard's donation ""is just more evidence proving that the greatest threat to the Fed's supposed monetary policy independence is its cozy ties to the executive branch.""
Mark Calabria, a former aide to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) and the director of financial-regulations studies at the Cato Institute, questioned the judgment of Ms. Brainard's donations. ""Given the perception of how close the Fed is to this administration and the Clintons already, it reinforces a bad impression,"" he said.
Stephen Oliner, a former senior Fed economist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that ""we're talking about relatively small sums of money,"" and noted that Ms. Brainard's actions were legal. However, he said ""the Fed is under so much scrutiny on the Hill, so anything that inflames the perception of political favoritism is not helpful to the institution.""
Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University specializing in Congress and the Fed, said the main issue surrounding the Brainard donation ""is the appearance of favoring one party of another."" Given the governor's background, it is no surprise that Ms. Brainard might favor Democrats over Republicans, Ms. Binder said, but the donation ""makes it harder for the Fed to maintain a squeaky clean reputation"" amid accusations by Republican lawmakers that the Fed is too close to the Treasury.
Ms. Brainard, who joined the Fed board in June 2014, served as an economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton and later worked as a senior Treasury official during the Obama administration. Her husband, Kurt Campbell, worked as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.
Ms. Brainard is the only current Fed governor to have made itemized donations to a presidential campaign in the run-up to this year's election, according to the FEC's records.
The FEC records itemize donations exceeding $200 in total over a two-year period, but not donations below that threshold. The Fed said it doesn't separately track or maintain records of donations to political committees.
Every sitting governor, including Ms. Yellen, made political campaign donations before joining the Fed board. And several have worked for previous administrations. Ms. Yellen and Fed governor Daniel Tarullo also worked at the Clinton White House, while governor Jerome Powell was a senior Treasury official under Republican President George H.W. Bush.
The FEC records show at least five of the 12 regional Federal Reserve bank presidents have donated to political campaigns, both before and during their terms of office.
Before becoming Minneapolis Fed President in January, Neel Kashkari, gave the maximum permitted individual donation to Jeb Bush's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Kashkari, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for governor of California in 2014, donated $2,700 in July last year, according to records confirmed by the Minneapolis Fed.
In 2014, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart gave $2,000 to Georgia Democrat Michelle Nunn's campaign for the Senate, the records show. Mr. Lockhart also made a 2014 donation to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jason Carter, grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, an Atlanta Fed spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said Mr. Lockhart believes that donation was $1,000.
Several other regional Fed presidents gave money to campaigns before their appointments. For example, FEC records show New York Fed President William Dudley and Dallas Fed President Robert Steven Kaplan donated to Democratic presidential campaigns. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker contributed to both Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns before joining the central bank.

"Democrats' Battle Shifts --- As race moves to friendlier ground for Clinton, Sanders works to broaden his appeal",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764279368?accountid=12768,"Democrats headed south and west after Sen. Bernie Sanders's resounding New Hampshire victory over Hillary Clinton, facing the twin questions of whether his appeal is broad enough to replicate his performance elsewhere -- and whether her support is strong enough to reverse the tide.
Lying at the crossroads of those two questions are the minority voters who have transformed the Democratic Party in the past few decades and hold the promise of sustained success in the future.
Mr. Sanders's first act after his 22-point victory in predominantly white New Hampshire was to travel to Harlem in New York on Wednesday and have breakfast with high-profile civil-rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton.
In an interview, Rev. Sharpton said that by coming to Harlem after ""such a big victory,"" Mr. Sanders ""wanted to send a signal"" to the party's minority voters. ""She has deeper ties [to the black community] and longstanding friends,"" Mr. Sharpton said of Mrs. Clinton, ""but that doesn't mean he can't win voters.""
Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign arranged a conference call Wednesday with prominent African-American figures who support the former secretary of state. They cast Mr. Sanders as an arriviste who has ignored issues important to African-Americans.
""It's good to have new friends -- I would prefer to have true friends,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), who plans to go to South Carolina to campaign for Mrs. Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton now is calling on the Clinton network of African-American supporters, looking to shore up the ""firewall"" her campaign says it has built in coming contests in South Carolina and other Southern states with large minority populations. The campaign is also tapping into her Hispanic network to sway Nevada voters.
On primary night, the Clinton campaign understood that a defeat was coming in the Granite State. But the breadth of the loss left some of her supporters rattled and former President Bill Clinton angry, according to two people familiar with his thinking.
Mr. Sanders beat her among women voters and won every age category save for voters over 65. He bested Mrs. Clinton not only among independents who participated in the primary -- and by a lopsided margin -- but topped her among Democratic Party members, 52% to 48%, exit polls showed.
That could prove important, as the next primaries and caucuses will have far larger shares of Democrats and smaller shares of independents, who are barred entirely from party primaries in some states. Some 58% of voters in the New Hampshire primary were Democrats. By contrast, Democrats accounted for 81% of Nevada caucus-goers and 73% of South Carolina primary voters during the last competitive contests, in 2008.
But Mr. Sanders's strength within the party's membership remains an open question. Mrs. Clinton carried Democratic Party members by 17 points in her narrow victory in Iowa's caucuses last week. And the Democrats in contests to come won't look like those in New Hampshire.
Where 93% of New Hampshire's Democratic primary voters were white, only 43% of South Carolina primary voters and 65% of Nevada caucus-goers in 2008 were white. The New Hampshire primary didn't test one of the most important features of the coming contests -- whether Mrs. Clinton is retaining the substantial advantages she has shown among African-American and Hispanic voters in opinion polls.
Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are planning to fan out in South Carolina in advance of the state's primary on Feb. 27, talking up Mrs. Clinton's credentials in a state where African-Americans account for more than half of the Democratic electorate.
""I'm going to preach and teach, tell people to get out and vote for Hillary,"" said Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), who was beaten by state troopers in Selma, Ala., in 1965 during a voting-rights protest.
Rep. Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.), the chairman of the black caucus's political-action committee, said that the group's board last week overwhelmingly voted to endorse Mrs. Clinton. Their formal announcement is expected on Thursday.
Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, noted that the contests on March 1 include Texas, Alabama and Georgia -- states with substantial ""communities of color.""
But Mr. Sanders is ceding no ground as his campaign has gained momentum. He won the endorsement of former NAACP President Ben Jealous, and he is about to roll out an ad that shows him marching with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1963 March on Washington, according to former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Richard Harpootlian.
""His bona fides are beyond question on civil rights, so older African-American voters as they see the TV commercial or radio ad will understand he's not some newcomer to their cause,"" Mr. Harpootlian said.
The tug of war between the Clinton and Sanders camps is putting pressure on one of South Carolina's most prominent officials to come forward with an endorsement.
Rep. Jim Clyburn, the only Democrat in South Carolina's delegation and a civil-rights leader with big sway in the state, has stayed neutral, but he may be coming off the fence soon, people familiar with the matter said.
""I'm feeling it,"" said Mr. Clyburn, declining to say whom he might endorse. ""I have a wife and three daughters"" and ""they are telling me that I need to take a stand.""

Election 2016: Clinton Raises Most Beltway Cash,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761971575?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- In a year in which campaigning against Washington is good politics, Hillary Clinton is vacuuming up campaign donations from all corners of the city -- and much of the suburbs.
Financial reports made public Sunday show Mrs. Clinton and her backers are trouncing their opponents when it comes to raising money from lobbyists, Washington insiders and large national labor unions. Of the 16 industries tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign giving, she outraised all other candidates in all but two business sectors -- the tobacco industry and the oil and gas sector.
The former senator and secretary of state raised twice as much money last year from the city's biggest lobbyists as all of her Republican and Democratic opponents combined. Meantime, a super PAC run by Mrs. Clinton's political backers raised more than $4 million from large national labor unions.
To be sure, campaign donations from lobbyists and the Washington establishment make up a fraction of the total amount of money contributed to the presidential candidates and super PACs each election. In 2012, lobbyists were responsible for about $1.7 million of the $850 million given to super PACs.
The lobbying industry ranks far below more lucrative sectors such as Wall Street, health care, Hollywood and home builders when it comes to campaign donations. But money from lobbyists and the Washington establishment could prove more symbolic this year, with so many candidates on both sides of the political spectrum talking up their distance from the entrenched political class.
In his speech after the Iowa caucuses Monday, Mrs. Clinton's chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, sought political gain from his lack of money from Washington and Wall Street. He said, ""We don't want their money, and I am very proud to tell you that we are the only candidate on the Democratic side without a super PAC.""
The three Republicans topping national polls -- Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- call themselves outsiders on the campaign trail, promising to ""take on Washington"" and complaining about being attacked by the establishment.
Mrs. Clinton, a former first lady, hasn't attempted to distance herself from the Washington establishment. But on the campaign trail, she has frequently called for overhauling the campaign-finance system -- either through appointing justices to the Supreme Court who would uphold campaign-contribution limits or through a constitutional amendment.
At a recent stop in Urbandale, Iowa, she said she cares more about ""protecting an individual's right to vote than a corporation's right to buy an election.""
Campaign money from lobbyists can be tallied in two different ways. Under the law, candidates must file reports with the Federal Election Commission showing how much money lobbyists have raised, or ""bundled,"" for their campaigns from clients, family members and other parts of their fundraising networks. Candidates are also required to disclose the occupations and employers of their donors.
A Wall Street Journal analysis shows Mrs. Clinton leads all others in donations from lobbyists by either measure -- though Mr. Rubio hovered close to her on one of them.
The bundling reports show that Washington lobbyists helped raise more than $2 million for Mrs. Clinton last year, the largest of any candidate. Mr. Rubio nearly matched her total from lobbyists in the final three months of 2015. Lobbyists raised about $715,000 for Mrs. Clinton in the period and about $675,000 for Mr. Rubio.
Overall, lobbyists raised a total of $1 million for Mr. Rubio's campaign last year, far less than for Mrs. Clinton, but more than for any other Republican. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush raised $400,000 from lobbyists last year, according to the reports.
A Wall Street Journal analysis of fundraising reports also shows Mrs. Clinton outpaced the field when it came to campaign donations directly from lobbyists to her campaign.
Mrs. Clinton raised $575,000 in donations from individuals who work at the 20 largest lobbying firms in Washington last year. Mr. Sanders raised $6,650 from individuals at the same firms last year.
Mr. Bush led Republicans with about $150,000 in donations from the top 20 lobbying shops in 2015, followed by Mr. Rubio with just more than $100,000.

"Clinton, Sanders Locked in Tie",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761637773?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Battling for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were locked in razor-tight contest for Iowa's delegates and the momentum that comes with a win in the nation's first contest.
Throughout the night, less than a percentage point separated the pair, with Mrs. Clinton in the lead. With 96% of precincts reporting, her advantage was just 49.9% of the delegates versus 49.6% for Mr. Sanders, according to tabulations from the Iowa Democratic Party.
""Tonight while the results are still not known it looks like we are in a virtual tie,"" Mr Sanders told cheering supporters. He added, ""I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message."" His cheering supporters replied, ""Feel the Bern!""
Mrs. Clinton, addressing her own supporters in Des Moines, said, ""It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now: to have a real contest of ideas, to really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for."" She added that she was ""breathing a big sigh of relief,"" though she didn't declare victory.
The results amounted to a virtual tie, and mean that Iowa will send roughly an equal number of delegates for each candidate to the party's national convention this summer, where the nominee will be officially selected. They also offer a dose of good news for both campaigns. Mr. Sanders can say that he battled the prohibitive front-runner to a tie, while Mrs. Clinton avoids what would have been an embarrassing defeat.
The upstart Vermont senator, whose entry to the Democratic presidential race barely registered, has both new money and new momentum. In January, Mr. Sanders raised $20 million, and with most of his donations well below the legal limit, he can go back to his donors for more.
""The thing that generally ends campaigns is lack of resources,"" said David Axelrod, who helped steer President Barack Obama's two victories. ""This does not seem to be a problem for the Sanders campaign, which continues to do prodigious grass-roots fundraising.""
Earlier, in a sweltering school lunchroom in Windsor Heights, a suburb of Des Moines, Clinton backers wooed their neighbors with offers of bottled water. A few miles away, in Clive, Sanders supporters ran out of seats so stood against the wall, beneath Sanders signs reading, ""A Future to Believe In.""
""She has the experience, she has the knowledge, she is qualified, she will get things done,"" said Vicky Daniel, who caucused for Mrs. Clinton in Windsor Heights. She flew back to Iowa from her winter home in Florida to participate, and when Mrs. Clinton was announced the winner in her caucus, ""I said, `yes, yes, yes.'""
But in Clive, west of Des Moines, Carol Ferrell, 59, decided at the last minute to support Mr. Sanders. ""As much as I admire Hillary Clinton, she's got a lot of baggage,"" she said.
Mrs. Clinton's showing was an improvement over her third-place finish in Iowa eight years ago, which made clear that her once-inevitable campaign faced a serious threat from another challenger, then-Sen. Barack Obama.
The Clinton campaign said it was well positioned for a long slog, and Mr. Sanders vowed to press on no matter the results.
Both candidates were traveling overnight to New Hampshire to begin a weeklong sprint to the Granite state primary, where Mr. Sanders is 18 points ahead of Mrs. Clinton, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls.
Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, is ahead in the states that come after that, and nationally. But the Sanders campaign believes a win in New Hampshire on top of a strong showing in Iowa would compel voters to give his campaign a second look.
""We've done what we came to do, which is establish him as a serious candidate,"" Sanders strategist Tad Devine said Monday, before the caucuses.
The Clinton campaign was bracing for a loss in New Hampshire, the state that rescued Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and revived Mrs. Clinton's 2008 effort.
""There are a lot of headwinds in New Hampshire,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said, noting that candidates from neighboring states, like Mr. Sanders, have almost always won New Hampshire in recent years.
But Mr. Mook said he feels optimistic looking ahead. He pointed to Mrs. Clinton's strong position in Nevada and South Carolina and in the swath of Southern states that will award a quarter of the delegates at stake on March 1. These states, where the Clinton campaign began organizing last summer, have more nonwhite voters than the states in the first two contests. Mrs. Clinton polls strongly among these voters and would continue to emphasize matters important to African-Americans, including her association with Mr. Obama, gun restrictions and the water crisis in Flint, Mich.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who has lagged far behind his competitors and had dwindling resources, suspended his campaign for the Democratic nomination after earning scant support in Iowa.
Over dozens of trips to Iowa high schools and diners, in small discussions and big rallies, the two leading candidates engaged in a vigorous and sometimes sharp debate as Mrs. Clinton positioned herself as a pragmatic, can-do fighter, while Mr. Sanders appealed to the party's most deeply held ideals.
She battled reports that classified material was sent via her private email system. He battled suggestions that he couldn't win a general election, and that he has no real plan to implement his agenda.
Still, he inspired voters who said they were attracted to his rejection of big-money politics and promise of a ""political revolution."" He drew crowds to arenas and a loyal online following, where backers taunted detractors to ""feel the Bern.""
In speeches that remained almost identical across months of campaigning, Mr. Sanders promised to break up large banks, said Wall Street is built on fraud and unapologetically vowed to impose higher taxes to provide universal health care, free tuition at public colleges and more generous Social Security benefits. At a rally Saturday, as Mr. Sanders ticked off society's problems, the crowd spontaneously began chanting, ""Enough is enough!""
""He has an extraordinary amount of conviction,"" said Zachery Love, a 19-year-old University of Iowa student, one of more than 4,000 people to turn out for a Sanders concert and rally Saturday night.
Mrs. Clinton, for her part, highlighted her perseverance and qualifications along with what she describes as a pragmatic, effective approach to governing. She also portrayed herself as the most electable candidate whose nomination is necessary to block Republican ideas.
Her policy platform includes a new program for debt-free tuition and an increase in solar panels, as well as change in health care and Social Security that are more modest than her rival's.
Her supporters, including many older women who grew up in a time of outright sex discrimination, say they are inspired by the idea of electing the first female president. And backers often say she is the most qualified candidate for the presidency they have ever encountered.
On Monday night, Deidre Fudge arrived early to her West Des Moines caucus to register support for Mrs. Clinton. ""I'm just a little worried about Bernie and his naivete,"" Ms. Fudge said. ""I appreciate her experience and level-headedness about what can actually get done.""

How Sanders Exposed Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764619431?accountid=12768,"Democrats awoke Wednesday with a thought usually reserved for Republicans: Hillary Clinton is a disaster. The marvel is that she fooled them for so long.
Picture Bernie Sanders as a small child in the court of Empress Clinton, and you have a modern twist on Hans Christian Andersen. The adoring Democratic townspeople oohed and aahed over their ""tough"" and ""experienced"" and ""masterful"" leader, the anointed heir to the Clinton throne. Then Bernie murmured what was obvious, and the crowd looked again.
What they saw in New Hampshire was a dour, 68-year-old woman, shouting at her audience in her best impression of emotion. They saw a gaunt former president, rambling to half-empty forums, grumping about his wife's political opponent. They saw the candidate's surrogates try to snag the votes of young women by threatening them with eternal damnation. They saw a campaign in disarray, dragging carload upon carload of ethical baggage. They saw that the empress has no (or very few) clothes.
No one knows whether Bernie Sanders can pull off a nomination. But what everyone does know now is that Hillary has (and is) a problem either way. Let's dispense with some spin: Bernie never had a lock on the Granite State. New Hampshire had stepped up for the Clintons twice before, in 1992 and 2008. This year Hillary went into the contest with endorsements, a huge operation and plenty of money.
What she didn't have was the interest of voters. They'd had their eyes opened, and they chose to use their primary to highlight Mrs. Clinton's many and obvious political weaknesses. She may still be the favorite to hold her party's banner, but the mantle of inevitability has been stripped away.
New Hampshire exposed again what a wooden candidate Hillary is. Mr. Sanders strolls on stage and makes his audience sing and cheer. Mrs. Clinton's events begin with propaganda videos about her past, followed by a tutorial on why she deserves this. They are heavy, and droning.
She cannot do uplifting. She had the same likability problem in her 2000 race for the Senate, when she had to spend a fortune to beat an unknown Republican in liberal New York. The same problem popped up in 2008, against Barack Obama. Why anyone thought she would improve on a third go is a mystery.
New Hampshire also uncovered the mismanagement that always attends the Clintons. Hillary wakes up every day with a new campaign. She ignores Mr. Sanders. Then she runs left. Then she attacks him. Then she softens. Her staff has endless debates, which always end up leaked to the press, about whether she needs to appear ""stronger,"" or more ""human,"" or ""sharper,"" or ""softer,"" or more ""pragmatic,"" or more ""lofty.""
She has a habit of unceremoniously firing campaign teams. And this scattershot approach comes from a woman who has been plotting to be president for at least a decade? All this shifting may be another reason why the public sees her as ""untrustworthy.""
To that point, New Hampshire proved that concerns about Mrs. Clinton's ethics aren't merely a right-wing talking point. They've permeated the electorate. Some stunning numbers: Among the one-third of Democratic primary voters who said ""honesty"" was the top quality they wanted in a nominee, Mr. Sanders won 91%. Among the quarter who said they focused on a candidate who ""cares about people like me,"" Mr. Sanders won 82%.
Finally, New Hampshire exposed how out of touch the Clinton machine is with the modern liberal movement. Mrs. Clinton based her campaign on the tropes of a fading Democratic establishment. She figured that women would vote for her simply because she had the right anatomy. She figured that college grads and wealthier Democrats would vote for her because she had more pragmatic policies. She figured that the bulk of voters still viewed the Clinton operation as a sure ticket to the White House.
In fairness, she won her age group -- those 65 or older, who grew up with the Clintons. But she lost everyone else: women, men, college grads, blue-collar workers. She lost every income level except those making more than $200,000. She lost liberals. And moderates.
What makes Mrs. Clinton's miscalculation notable is that the party's shift was on full, neon view before she even entered the race. It was walking around in the form of Elizabeth Warren. The worry for Mrs. Clinton is that she might be unable to heal the rifts. Barack Obama's soaring rhetoric was able to reunite his party in 2008. Hillary doesn't have his skills.
Responsibility for her crushing New Hampshire defeat can't be placed on Mrs. Clinton alone. Her party leadership is in it with her. Since 2008 the Clinton juggernaut has projected Hillary as the party's only option, and Democrats bought it. They closed their eyes to her flaws and scandals, ignored the shifting progressive winds, pushed potential rivals aside, and raved about the empress's lovely clothes. Then Bernie started whispering.

"Election 2016: Clinton, Sanders Clash Over Cost of Plans --- Former secretary of state also questions the senator's loyalty to President Obama",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764615768?accountid=12768,"MILWAUKEE -- Hillary Clinton pressed Bernie Sanders on the viability of his proposals for free health care and college tuition in a Democratic presidential debate Thursday, and questioned his loyalty to President Barack Obama for past statements calling the president weak and a disappointment.
In a wide-ranging exchange, the first after the candidates split victories in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the Democratic contenders agreed with each other more than they disagreed and appealed to the minority voters who will play a larger role in the next two races, in South Carolina and Nevada.
Mrs. Clinton tethered herself to Mr. Obama, who remains enormously popular with the African-American voters she is relying on to help her campaign. She cast herself as the keeper of his legacy, repeatedly injected praise for his record and attacked Mr. Sanders for criticism he has leveled against the president.
""The kind of criticism we've heard from Sen. Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans -- I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination,"" she said. ""That is a low blow,"" he replied, saying he has worked closely with Mr. Obama. But he added: ""Last I heard, we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard a U.S. senator had the right to disagree with the president. So I have voiced criticisms.""
Mrs. Clinton said that disagreement was fine but Mr. Sanders went too far suggesting a primary challenge to him in 2011, calling him weak and a disappointment. The Vermont senator's final retort, harking back to the 2008 Democratic primary: ""One of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.""
The debate elicited few surprises and revealed no significant change in tactics by either camp that could shift the dynamics of what appears to be a highly competitive fight for the Democratic Party presidential nomination that isn't likely to be resolved for months.
Mr. Sanders didn't hesitate to stand by his proposal to impose new taxes on the wealthy and Wall Street to provide new government services. However, he appeared to have no reply when the former secretary of state pointed out that his education proposal would require Republican governors to spend more money to make it happen.
Mr. Sanders's plan ""rests on making sure that governors, like Scott Walker [of Wisconsin], contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I'm a little skeptical,"" she said, to loud applause.
An unexpected historical figure made his way into the debate: Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state and national security adviser under President Richard Nixon. Mr. Sanders sought to put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive, noting that she has said she has taken advice from Mr. Kissinger and citing his role in the secret bombings of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.
""I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I'm proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.""
Mrs. Clinton struck back, seeking to portray Mr. Sanders as unprepared for the world's foreign policy challenges. ""Journalists have asked, who do you listen to on policy and we have yet to know who that is,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger, that's for sure,"" Mr. Sanders said.
While the exchange seemed an unusual detour, the Sanders campaign followed it with a memo to reporters detailing its view on Kissinger's policies.
The debate opened with a tense exchange over one of the pair's sharpest policy differences -- Mr. Sanders's proposal to create a single-payer health-care system that would replace private insurance with a government-funded system.
Mr. Sanders said it is imperative for the U.S. to guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege. Mrs. Clinton questioned his assertion that a typical American family will see $500 more in taxes while saving $5,000 in health-care costs.
""The numbers don't add up,"" she said. ""That's a promise that cannot be kept.""
Mr. Sanders responded by speaking of a general imperative. ""Here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people,"" he said.
Mrs. Clinton replied that the U.S. system is fundamentally different from European countries, which have government systems, and that the Affordable Care Act was meant to build on the employer-based system in place.
Mrs. Clinton suggested that her opponent was promising more than he could deliver as president and would plunge the country back into another protracted debate over health care: ""We have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why we should not make promises we can't keep.""
She said she has specified what her proposals would cost -- $100 billion a year. ""Once I'm in the White House, we will have enough political capital"" to close tax loopholes and raise taxes on wealthy Americans -- steps that would pay for her programs, she said.
In reply, Mr. Sanders seized on her prediction that she will be the next president. ""Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet,"" he said.

"Clinton's Wall Street Talks Were Highly Paid, Friendly",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764613227?accountid=12768,"In the two years between resigning as secretary of state and launching her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton personally received $4.1 million in fees from financial institutions for closed-door talks that attendees described as friendly and light.
Today, the speeches have become an issue in her campaign. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her rival in the Democratic primary, has repeatedly attacked her ties to Wall Street, including her large speech fees.
Most of Mrs. Clinton's comments steered clear of anything that could become controversial in her fight for the Democratic nomination, say people who attended some of these events or were briefed on them. She didn't often talk about the financial crisis, but when she did, she almost always struck an amicable tone, according to these people.
In some cases, she thanked the audience for what they had done for the country, the people said. One attendee said the warmth with which Mrs. Clinton greeted guests bordered on ""gushy.""
In a discussion with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives and some of its asset-management clients in October 2013, she spoke sympathetically about the financial industry, according to an attendee. Asked about the poisoned national mood toward Wall Street, Mrs. Clinton didn't single out bankers or any other group for causing the 2008 financial crisis. Instead, she effectively said, ""We're all in this together, we've got to find our way out of it together,"" the attendee said.
Mrs. Clinton has said she would look into releasing the contents of her talks, many of which were transcribed by a stenographer that she requested be present. Her team is reviewing transcripts from dozens of speeches to assess potential pitfalls of releasing them to the public, people close to Mrs. Clinton said.
Some in the Clinton camp are concerned that comments not just about Wall Street, but also on the health-care law and foreign leaders could be taken out of context in an election season, they added.
A campaign spokesman declined to comment on whether transcripts would be released.
Mr. Sanders, in his attacks on Mrs. Clinton, has questioned why firms such as Goldman paid her $225,000 a speech. When asked at a CNN event last week to explain why she was paid these sums, Mrs. Clinton said, ""I don't know, that's what they offered.""
The fees and other details were negotiated on behalf of Mrs. Clinton by the Harry Walker Agency, a speakers' bureau that represented her. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment. Mrs. Clinton's profile page was missing from its website as of last week.
Beginning in early 2013, after leaving the State Department, Mrs. Clinton embarked on a two-year speaking career, making $21.7 million from about 100 speeches to universities, economic clubs, trade groups, investment banks, private-equity firms and several Canadian entities.
About one in five dollars that Mrs. Clinton collected while giving speeches from February 2013 to April 2015 came from banks and financial institutions.
She spoke at three client conferences hosted by Goldman Sachs; twice at Deutsche Bank AG; once each at events organized by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and UBS; and also at gatherings hosted by private-equity firms KKR & Co., Apollo Management Holdings LP and GTCR LLC.
The Goldman alternative investments conference, where she also addressed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, was one of the few times Mrs. Clinton directly addressed questions about the financial crisis when speaking to Wall Street firms, according to people familiar with the matter. She said Dodd-Frank was working, but that there were ways it could be strengthened, the people said.
More often, Mrs. Clinton was asked about her four-year term as secretary of state, with people in the financial community curious to know what she thought of foreign leaders, U.S. foreign policy and whether she planned to run for president in 2016, said people familiar with the matter.
In April 2013, she was invited by Morgan Stanley to speak to clients of its fixed-income business at a conference dinner at the Library of Congress. In a 20-minute question-and-answer session, Thomas Nides, a Morgan Stanley vice chairman who had just returned to the bank after working as Mrs. Clinton's deputy in the State Department, lobbed what people familiar with the session described as gentle questions at his former boss.
Mrs. Clinton recounted the events leading to the capture of Osama bin Laden, among other topics. At the end of the event, she posed for photographs with attendees, as stipulated in her contract. Little was said about the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the conversation. The bank paid her $225,000.
Although some of her paid speeches were open to the public, those she made to financial firms were confidential. The contracts sent around by Mrs. Clinton's agency to these and other firms usually included extensive stipulations. They barred audio and video recordings, as well as broadcasts.
High-profile political speakers often ban recordings, but Mrs. Clinton was unusual in requiring that a stenographer be present to record and transcribe her remarks. In these cases, she had the sole right to distribute the transcripts.
Many of the events hosted by the financial firms were moderated discussions or Q&A sessions; in some, Mrs. Clinton typically made prepared remarks before taking questions from the audience.
In late October 2013, she sat down for an evening Q&A with Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs. The audience at the Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain, Ariz., was mostly technology entrepreneurs and senior Goldman executives. Mr. Blankfein started out by asking Mrs. Clinton for a ""survey of the world,"" according to an attendee and a person briefed on the matter.
She told the audience how world leaders often asked her why politics in the nation's capital had become so gridlocked, saying it was hurting the U.S.'s reputation abroad.

Election 2016: Subpoena Said to Be Issued To the Clinton Foundation,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764612852?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's family charitable foundation received a subpoena from government investigators last year, a person familiar with the matter said.
The Clinton Foundation was asked to turn over records and documents to the State Department's Office of Inspector General, the agency's independent watchdog.
The subpoena asked for information on some of the foundation's charitable work that may have required government approval, as well as records about longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the news. The Clinton Foundation didn't return requests for comment.
Ms. Abedin, who held simultaneous roles with the State Department and the foundation, has previously been the target of a probe by the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee. The State Department's inspector general also found that Ms. Abedin was overpaid by almost $10,000 for unused paid leave time when she left the government -- a finding she disputed.
A spokesperson for the State Department inspector general declined to comment. An attorney for Ms. Abedin didn't respond to a request for comment.
Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, said ""there are questions that need to be asked about the independence of that office."" Speaking on CNN about the State Department inspector general, he said the office has engaged in ""partisan fishing expeditions.""
Separately, a federal judge on Thursday ordered releases of Mrs. Clinton's emails in advance of three primary elections or caucuses, citing public interest in the Democratic presidential candidate's records.
In an order as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Vice News reporter Jason Leopold, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras instructed the State Department to post all the emails ready for release in four batches on Feb. 13, Feb. 19, Feb. 26 and Feb. 29. Three of those dates fall the day before important Democratic election days -- injecting an element of uncertainty and political drama into the final releases of Mrs. Clinton's email trove.
Mrs. Clinton is locked in a close primary battle with Sen. Bernie Sanders. She beat the Vermont senator narrowly in Iowa; he came back to defeat her by 22 points in the New Hampshire primary this week.
Established as a vehicle to further the post-presidential work of former President Bill Clinton, the foundation is best known for its work on global development issues.
The State Department inspector general is also probing information management issues at the State Department, including Mrs. Clinton's use of a personal email server for government work.
In last week's Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton said she was ""absolutely"" certain the investigations into her time at the State Department wouldn't affect her candidacy -- portraying them as political fishing expeditions.

An Empty Obama-Clinton-Sanders Plan on Drug Costs; Requiring drug-by-drug data on R&D spending shows a misunderstanding of how my industry works.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774654778?accountid=12768,"President Obama's latest budget includes proposals--echoed or one-upped on the presidential-campaign trail by Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton--that would require pharmaceutical companies to release data on the cost of research and development (R&D) and the extent of discounts offered to insurers for each drug brought to market. Yet the key numbers already are disclosed freely--and we know how to get better value from medicines and improve their affordability to patients.
The company I lead, Lilly, discloses its annual R&D spending in audited financial statements every year, like other public companies. Lilly's number for 2015 was $4.8 billion--part of the $50 billion invested in R&D each year by the members of our industry association alone. That's more than 20% of all R&D spending by all U.S. businesses. Seen against that staggering total, the proposal to mandate the nearly impossible task of assembling drug-by-drug R&D-spending figures misses the whole point.
Pharmaceutical companies' R&D feeds innovation from the earliest identification of leads through to clinical trials, real-world data collection and the refinement of existing treatments. It includes the cost of myriad failures--part of every scientific enterprise--along with further research on approved medicines, right up to their patent expirations. Money made on the sale of today's new medicines feeds all of the indispensable streams in this complex ecosystem.
Averages are easy enough to come by--a new academic study in the Journal of Health Economics says it takes about $2.6 billion in R&D investment per new medicine launched. Calculating a precise number for an individual product is quite another matter. Consider Lilly's investment of billions of dollars in R&D related to Alzheimer's disease over the last quarter century. Since there are several candidates in our pipeline that emerged from past work, to which future product and in what proportion should these costs be allocated? And to what end?
The key insight is beyond dispute. Developing medicines is risky, expensive and time-consuming, and everyone would be better off if it were less so. Rather than meaningless disclosure mandates, policy efforts instead should encourage whatever can be done, without compromising patient safety, to shave precious weeks off development and regulatory-approval timelines.
There are effective ways to do that. For example, pooling access to potential new molecules and sharing ""pre-competitive"" research on promising treatment paths could avoid costly duplication. Industry and the FDA could ramp up the use of ""adaptive clinical trials"" that refocus themselves based on real-time findings rather than starting over. And large-scale efforts to capture the real-world outcomes of treatments in genetically profiled patients--and feed these insights back to R&D labs--would accelerate progress significantly.
Mandating further disclosure of discounts negotiated by drug companies also is a route to nowhere. Lest anyone doubt that the discounts are substantial, allow me to report freely that the average net prices paid last year by Lilly's customers in the U.S. ranged from a high of 67% of list prices paid by commercial health plans to a low of 19% paid by government purchasers including Medicaid. That's right: The average discount off list price was more than 80% for government payers.
I'm not cherry-picking these figures--they cover Lilly's entire portfolio of established products. But forcing Lilly, or other companies, to disclose product-by-product and payer-by-payer discounts would be an unprecedented affront to free-market competition.
The list prices of medicines that feed media sensationalism are paid by essentially no institutional or government buyer in a hotly competitive marketplace. Yet affordability remains a problem for many patients. That's because insured patients in the U.S. today pay an average of about 20% of their prescription-drug costs out-of-pocket compared with about 5% of their hospital costs. Some patients' cost shares are much worse--due to complex insurance ""tier"" systems for drugs and the rise of ""combined deductibles,"" in which drug expenses get lumped together with major-medical costs, and benefits hinge on reaching a high expense threshold.
The insurance bias against medicines needs to be addressed head-on, at the very least so that patients benefit from the savings negotiated by their insurers. Clearing the Food and Drug Administration's huge backlog of generic-drug applications would also be a great help.
Lilly and Anthem, a major insurer, recently asked for changes in federal regulations that make it difficult to set up ""outcomes-based contracts."" These would link payment for a drug to the presentation of evidence that patients achieved the health benefits expected from the drug, for example.
The realities that determine the cost of medicines to patients don't require mandated disclosures. They are as plain as day. They simply need to be acknowledged and acted upon rather than distorted and ignored.

"Election 2016: Nevada Union's Silence Clouds Caucus --- Clinton, Sanders battle for support of culinary workers after group forgoes endorsement",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767301907?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS -- Eight years ago, Nevada's powerful Culinary Union mobilized to support its chosen candidate, Barack Obama, helping to boost turnout in the Democratic presidential caucuses and build credibility for what was still a long-shot campaign.
This time around, casino workers and their family members are up for grabs.
Leading into Saturday's Democratic caucus,the Culinary Union has withheld an endorsement, adding to the uncertainty around voter turnout and the outcome. It has also pushed the campaigns of Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to go to aggressive lengths to find and court the union workers who cook, wash dishes, waitress and clean rooms in this tourism mecca.
Mr. Sanders came to the union offices last year even before he announced he was running for president, and he showed up this week at a protest outside a hospital, which Mrs. Clinton also attended. Earlier, his representatives went into employee dining halls at casinos and talked to workers while wearing union pins, a tactic the union said was inappropriate. Mr. Sanders' campaign chalked the issue up to a misunderstanding.
Mrs. Clinton in November appeared at an organizing rally outside a hotel co-owned by Donald Trump to support a union-organizing campaign there. She has met union members at several casinos in the last week.
""Both have shown a lot of support to come speak to us,"" said Nelson Lucero, a barista at the New York New York casino, who said he hadn't settled on a candidate. ""I think that's really important.""
With 57,000 members, the culinary workers' union, which is overwhelmingly Hispanic and Democratic, dominates state politics to an extent nearly unmatched elsewhere.
In past campaigns, the union made up much of the ground game for the candidates it supported. Part of its strength comes from being able to visit workers and talk to them about politics in the employee-only backhouses of casinos.
That was a factor in the 2008 and 2012 presidential races, as well as in Democratic Sen. Harry Reid's tight re-election campaign in 2010. The union also played a role in ousting several Republican state legislators, according to state political experts.
A variety of factors this year led the executive board of the Culinary Union's parent union, Unite Here, to vote in January not to endorse a candidate. The union has said that the primary factor in that decision was contract negotiations that are taking up time and resources.
""We made the decision to focus on union business over political business,"" said Yvanna Cancela, the union's political director.
One key issue, according to several people familiar with the matter, was a dispute with the Obama administration over some aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The union fought the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% excise-tax increase on high-cost health-care plans, including those covering Culinary Union members. Mr. Obama signed into law a two-year delay on the tax late last year, but he had refused the union's demands that the tax be removed altogether.
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders both supported the removal, but union officials wanted more evidence they would work against it, people familiar with the matter said.
The union learned that it ""should expect more from politicians than campaign promises,"" one person familiar with its thinking said.
The AFL-CIO, the national union organization of which Unite Here is a part, also said this week that it wouldn't endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.
For the Culinary Union, the nonendorsement allows it to avoid some of the awkward infighting that occurred eight years ago, when it endorsed Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton won the largest number of votes in the caucuses, but Mr. Obama won the most delegates.
The union's decision not to endorse a candidate could have implications for state Democrats in the fall. Some close to the Culinary Union say that with the union sitting out recent elections, they sense enthusiasm for politics could be down.
But Ms. Cancela said the union plans to heavily re-engage ahead of the general election to support the Democratic nominee.
It has started preparing by launching an organizing drive to gain citizenship for its members, so that they will be able to vote, and to register 12,000 additional members to vote.

Election 2016: Sanders and Clinton Vie for Rural Nevadans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766612386?accountid=12768,"ELKO, Nev. -- Hours away from the glam and glitter of Las Vegas, a fierce contest between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is playing out in the mountains and deserts of Nevada.
State caucus rules give rural counties outsize weight in the delegate-allocation process, a directive aimed at ensuring candidates don't just campaign in the cities.
Consequently, the road to victory in Saturday's Democratic caucuses runs through places like Elko, a small mountain mining community that is the closest thing to a major city in northeast Nevada, and Pahrump, a desert town of about 36,000 that boasts a handful of casinos, a couple of brothels -- and Clinton and Sanders campaign field offices.
And both campaigns are working these sparsely populated communities, phoning supporters daily and driving to remote houses on dirt roads to knock on doors and see if the people who answer might need a lift to caucus sites.
Mr. Sanders brought his pitch to Elkoon Friday, a picturesque mountain town of 20,000 people that lies more than 300 miles north of Las Vegas in a conservative part of the state. He was following Mrs. Clinton, who flew in earlier in the week. Republican candidates, who hold their caucusesTuesday, were expected to start arriving in northern Nevada over the next few days.
""Tomorrow, the eyes of America and the eyes of much of the world are going to focus on Nevada,"" Mr. Sanders said at a rally. ""And the issue is not just who wins the Democratic nomination. The issue is whether Nevada will play a leading role in moving this country toward a political revolution which transforms this country -- whether the people of Nevada will say enough is enough.""
With polls showing the race as a dead heat, Mr. Sanders spent the day before the caucuses stumping in Elko and Reno before returning to Las Vegas for a large rally. Mrs. Clinton made stops in both Reno and Elko earlier in the week.
Though the overwhelming majority of the state's people live in and around Las Vegas, campaigns ignore the rural areas at their own peril. In the 2008 Democratic race between Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama, she won the state but Mr. Obama collected more delegates in part because of a stronger organization and presence in the rural areas.
""She won the popular vote, but she did not win the caucus because caucuses are based on delegates,"" said Joan Kato, a former aide to Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign who now serves as the state director for Mr. Sanders. Nevada has 23 delegates up for grabs in this year's caucuses.
That was a mistake her campaign didn't plan to repeat. She has offices in Elko, Pahrump, and Carson City, and organizers across the state. Mr. Sanders has 12 field offices, though his campaign started organizing in Nevada months after Mrs. Clinton arrived.
The Clinton campaign says its staffers logged 1,250 miles across rural Nevada last summer, sending senior campaign leaders into communities for a listening tour that helped shape the campaign's rural strategy.
Former President Bill Clinton also visited Pahrump this month and spoke to a few hundred people at an elementary school.
Gabe Alvare, a 24-year-old Clinton volunteer visiting from New York City, spent hours knocking on doors of known supporters on Wednesday in Pahrump, making sure they planned to show up for the caucus. Another Clinton volunteer, Frank Dix, 73, lives in Pahrump and feels a special loyalty to the Clinton family. ""I'm partial to strong women,"" Mr. Dix said.
There is no surefire way to get people to turn up at the caucus sites. One person mentioned that softball practice posed a potential conflict. A woman said her husband was planning to go, but he hasn't been feeling good lately.
At a spartan office nearby, the Sanders campaign was also working to get out the vote. Volunteers were making calls and planning a mock caucus session so attendees would know what to expecton Saturday.
Rick Bandell, a 75-year-old retiree, said he was thrilled to call one home and persuade an entire family to show up in support of Mr. Sanders. ""I got four people in one call,"" he said. ""They're going to caucus for Bernie. It's very unusual. I'd be happy to just to get one.""

Election 2016: Clinton Tries New Message: It's About 'We',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767266181?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is voicing a new message: It isn't all about her.
The Democratic front-runner has spent much of the campaign talking about herself: how she is qualified for the presidency, how she knows how to govern, how she has gotten results. By contrast, rival Bernie Sanders has long talked about his quest for a political revolution as a collective effort that wouldn't succeed without the support of millions of Americans.
Now, there appears to be a subtle shift under way in Mrs. Clinton's rhetoric.
In her speech the night of this month's Iowa caucuses, she used ""I"" 37 times, and ""we"" or ""we're"" 25 times. In New Hampshire a week later, she used ""I"" 38 times and ""we"" 12 times.
Those numbers were reversed on Saturday after her victory in Nevada. She used the word ""I"" just 11 times, and ""we"" or ""we're"" 47 times.
""We're going to go into the future together,"" she said Saturday. Talking about the need for corporate responsibility, she said, ""We all have to do our part."" And in a move perhaps most important to her campaign, she challenged young people, who have overwhelmingly favored Mr. Sanders, to think not just about government solutions but community solutions -- a contrast with the Vermont senator's promise for free college and free national health care.
""It can't be just about what we're going to give you,"" she said. ""It has to be about what we're going to build together.""
It is an open question as to whether these shifts can address Mrs. Clinton's key vulnerabilities. In all three states to have voted, surveys showed that Mr. Sanders overwhelmingly won voters who said their priority was choosing a candidate who cares about people like them. He also easily won voters who said they most want a candidate who is honest and trustworthy.
Changing these perceptions won't be easy, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged Sunday on CNN.
""I think there's an underlying question that maybe is really in the back of people's minds. And that is, you know, is she in it for us, or is she in it for herself? I think that's . . . a question that people are trying to sort through,"" she said. ""I have to . . . make my case.""
In fits and starts, Mrs. Clinton has worked to show a different side of herself to voters.
She naturally gravitates toward a discussion of policy, and she often revs up the crowd with high-volume denunciations of the nation's ills. Many observers, including some of her top aides, think it is important that she mix in the softer side of her personality that comes through in quieter moments.
The campaign found one such moment in Las Vegas, and turned it into a powerful TV spot. During a forum on immigration, a 10-year-old girl told Mrs. Clinton that she is scared her parents would be deported. Mrs. Clinton brought her to stand close by and promised to do everything she could to help.
""You're being really brave,"" she told the girl, saying her parents don't want her to worry. ""Let me do the worrying. I'll do all the worrying. Is that a deal?""
The ad reinforce Mrs. Clinton's support for legalization of people in the U.S. illegally, but it showcased the emotions, not the policy.
It was reminiscent of a TV spot earlier in the campaign featuring a little girl asking Mrs. Clinton whether she would be paid the same as a man if she is president. Its power was in the way Mrs. Clinton answered the question, and less about the underlying question of gender pay equity, one adviser said.
The new ad with the scared little girl helped win Nevada, the adviser added. ""The side of Hillary Clinton that we know but need to show is that person who is understanding and connects,"" he said.

Democrats Weak on Social Security Reform; None of the Social Security reform proposals put forward by Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is new.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775731920?accountid=12768,"Regarding Andrew G. Biggs's ""Hillary's and Bernie's Pie-in-the-Sky Social Security Proposals "" (op-ed, March 18): None of the Social Security reform proposals put forward by Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is new. All their proposals mirror features of European state pension plans, all of which face financing problems due in part to their rich benefits but mainly as a result of a lack of economic growth and demographic decline.
A serious policy to stabilize Social Security would gradually raise the retirement age to 69. The ceiling below which earnings are liable to the OASDI tax would be raised so that it covers 90% of earnings. If those two measures prove inadequate, tax should be increased modestly.
We should scrap the 75-year financial-planning window. No one knows how the economy will perform up to 2091 or how it will perform over the next five years. We should separate the finances of the retirement plan from the disability plan. We should stop cross-subsidizing the disability plan using funds from the retirement plan's reserve. We should take steps to stabilize the finances of the disability plan, primarily by limiting access to it so that it cannot be used as a de facto retirement program.
The government should implement policies that will promote economic growth by reducing both corporate and personal income-tax rates, allowing multinational companies to repatriate profits earned overseas without taxing them, reducing the burden of regulation, promoting immigration and reversing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The single most important short-term obstacle to solving Social Security's financial problems is the federal government.

Election 2016: Sanders Keeps Up Heat on Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769886495?accountid=12768,"PORTLAND, Maine -- Sen. Bernie Sanders and his top aides showed no sign they would dial back their harsh words for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, and promised to press ahead in the face of her growing delegate lead.
At a rally here ahead of Maine's caucuses this Sunday, Mr. Sanders pressed Mrs. Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street firms and mocked the idea that anything she said could have been worth the six-figure speaking fees she collected. He also reminded his audience that Mrs. Clinton once had been considered ""the inevitable nominee.""
""Guess what? She's not so inevitable today,"" he said. He celebrated the four states he won in voting on Tuesday without mentioning the seven states -- most of them much bigger -- that she carried.
Mr. Sanders has the money to press on as long as he wants, though Democrats may grow impatient with him out of fear that he will damage the woman who may ultimately represent them in November.
""Given the current trajectory, there may come a point when he will have to make a judgment about whether he can still win and how aggressively on the attack he wants to be if he can't,"" said David Axelrod, who helped steer President Barack Obama's two victories.
The Clinton campaign argued the contest was fast growing out of Mr. Sanders's reach. After Tuesday's voting, her lead among delegates chosen by voters grew to nearly 200, a bigger margin than Mr. Obama ever enjoyed in his 2008 battle for the nomination against Mrs. Clinton.
""Over the upcoming weeks, we intend to steadily add to Hillary Clinton's already sizable lead in delegates, and as we do, it will become harder and harder mathematically for Sen. Sanders to ever catch up,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in a ""state of the race"" memo.
After Tuesday's voting, Mrs. Clinton was assured of at least 581 pledged delegates, who are chosen by voters, with Mr. Sanders claiming at least 388. The Mook memo contrasts Mr. Sanders's biggest win in his home state of Vermont, where he netted 16 delegates, to Mrs. Clinton's biggest victory of the night, in Texas, where she took 78.
Mrs. Clinton also has a huge lead among super delegates, party leaders who can vote for anyone. When those are included, her total tops 1,000, almost halfway to the number needed to clinch.
Tad Devine, a senior strategist for Mr. Sanders, said their campaign would make up ground as the race shifts to states with more favorable demographics. Mrs. Clinton's blow-out wins across the South were built on strong support from African-American voters, whereas coming states have larger share of white voters, who support Mr. Sanders in greater numbers.
However, after losing the white vote in Nevada, Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday rebounded, capturing 57% of the white vote in Virginia and essentially tying with Mr. Sanders among white voters in Massachusetts. She also won the white vote in Tennessee and Georgia.
Mr. Sanders's next opportunity comes this weekend with caucuses in Nebraska and Kansas, as well as Maine. He is also targeting Michigan's primary on Tuesday.
""We have to win a lot of places, beginning this weekend, and that's what we intend to do,"" Mr. Devine said.
Mr. Mook wrote that Mr. Sanders may win in the weekend's caucuses, but said Mrs. Clinton will more than make up any deficit with a victory in Louisiana, which votes Saturday. If Mr. Sanders wins in Michigan on Tuesday, Mr. Mook said, Mrs. Clinton will offset that with a bigger win in Mississippi, whose primary is the same day.
""The end result is that Sen. Sanders will spend millions of dollars in Michigan but not make any net gain in pledged delegates because he isn't competing in states like Mississippi,"" Mr. Mook predicted.
But if the race was all but over, it wasn't obvious in Maine, where a line of Sanders supporters snaked for blocks along downtown streets in near-freezing weather waiting to crowd into a local theater to hear him speak.
""The states that are coming up are lot more favorable than some of the ones on Super Tuesday, and he has a really good shot,"" said Evan O'Day-Senior, 30 years old.
The crowd numbered 2,400, though almost all the faces were white, a sign Mr. Sanders is still struggling to expand his coalition despite his campaign's promises, repeated on Wednesday, to do just that.
Given Mrs. Clinton's advantage, some Democrats were itching for Mr. Sanders to tone down his attacks. ""If his goal is to simply deliver a message, he should think twice before criticizing the likely nominee who is on the verge of entering what promises to be a brutal general election campaign that will require Democrats to be unified,"" said Democratic strategist Ben Labolt, a former Obama aide.
Sanders aides explicitly rejected any suggestion that he is a ""message candidate,"" and the senator showed no signs of toning down his criticism.

Election 2016: Group Can Investigate Clinton's Email Use,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767558455?accountid=12768,"A federal judge will allow a conservative watchdog group to gather evidence in a lawsuit against the State Department about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email server, creating the possibility that State Department officials could testify in a civil lawsuit over the Democratic presidential candidate's email practices when she was a cabinet official.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan on Tuesday granted Judicial Watch's request to allow depositions and discovery into how and why the State Department permitted Mrs. Clinton to use a personal email server for government business while she was secretary of state. He also authorized questioning about why the server wasn't searched as part of requests for Mrs. Clinton's public records.
In its request to the District of Columbia federal court, Judicial Watch proposed interviews under oath with top Clinton aides and confidantes, including Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills and information technology staffer Bryan Pagliano.
Other proposed depositions included top State Department officials such as Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy and John Hackett, the official responsible for Freedom of Information issues at the agency.
""This is one of several lawsuits filed by the same right-wing group, which will stop at nothing in pursuing the Clintons, just as they have done since the 1990s"" said Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill.
""The department is aware of the order and we are reviewing it,"" a State Department official said.
The process of gathering testimony is likely to play out over several months as the presidential campaign continues. Final details of the discovery proposal still need to be submitted and approved by Judge Sullivan, a Bill Clinton appointee, who said he wants briefings on the discovery plan to wrap up by April 12.
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in an interview that he expects to start the discovery process within days after that deadline.
The request for discovery doesn't include a mention of Mrs. Clinton as a potential witness. Mr. Fitton said a deposition of her could be a possibility if the group decides to pursue one.
Transcripts of depositions of State Department witnesses or written responses by the State Department to Judicial Watch questions could be made public before the November election, according to University of Arizona law professor David Marcus, an expert on federal civil procedure.
But factors could also slow discovery down, said Mr. Marcus. Those could include scheduling disagreements and complications involving witnesses, the amount of time the government seeks to review transcripts or recordings, or appeals of discovery orders, he said. The State Department also could seek to seal discovery documents on a number of grounds, including that they contain vital national security secrets.
The decision to allow Judicial Watch to proceed with its lawsuit, which doesn't name Mrs. Clinton as a defendant, opens up another front in the controversy over her use of a private email server while at the State Department. That arrangement was discouraged but not forbidden by department rules.
Under federal law, Mrs. Clinton's records are eligible for release under the Freedom of Information Act. She has said repeatedly that she wants them made public.

"Presidential Candidates and Antiterrorism; Even the worst of the four candidates he mentions, Hillary Clinton, would do a better job fighting terror than has Barack Obama.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777838179?accountid=12768,"The answer to the question Daniel Henninger raises in ""Antiterrorism After Obama "" (Wonder Land, March 24) is fairly simple. Even the worst of the four candidates he mentions, Hillary Clinton, would do a better job fighting terror than has Barack Obama. The only real question is how much she has been infected by political correctness, which would limit her effectiveness.
Political correctness is really a psychological incapacity to think dynamically. Even if reality demands change, leftists resist any imperative to do so. Their identities are so wrapped up in their ideology that a change of mind would amount to an act of self-negation, therefore they would no longer exist as the people they are. Homeostasis, whether wrapped in the veneer of a revolutionary or ""progressive"" identity, is their peace of mind no matter how perversely it contradicts facts or logic. Indeed, the hallmark of contemporary liberalism is the evasion of decisiveness--moral or otherwise.
This is precisely why President Obama doesn't deviate from his economic policies no matter how much a change in thinking would help improve the economy. He simply doesn't want to be proved wrong. In a similar fashion, changing course in his terrorism policy would amount to letting the terrorists ""win,"" even if those changes were based on a better self-defense. So the question remains, has Hillary Clinton internalized this cognitive dissonance from her fellow liberals or is she only guided by her congenital difficulties with transparency and the truth?
On that score, the only candidate who isn't plagued by such demons is John Kasich.

Sanders Steps Up Clinton Attacks,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761395396?accountid=12768,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders, closing out his campaign in Iowa, took a strategic gamble in hopes of notching a victory over Hillary Clinton in the state's Democratic caucuses Monday night: He went negative.
The Sanders campaign ran a new TV spot that implies Mrs. Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street. And after refusing to talk about the Democratic front-runner's use of a private email server as secretary of state, Mr. Sanders on Sunday called her email practices a ""very serious issue"" that could render her unelectable.
Similarly, a Clinton campaign that had once ignored the 74-year-old democratic socialist is now casting him as a pie-in-the-sky dreamer whose ideas are utterly impractical.
""I don't want to over-promise and under-deliver. I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver,"" she said at a rally here. She added: ""I know what it's going to take.""
This wasn't the way many thought the Democratic primary would conclude before the balloting began.
When he jumped in the race in May, Mr. Sanders looked to many Democratic officials like a candidate who wanted a forum to talk about income inequality in America and who didn't really believe he could win. But the Vermont senator's success at raising money and attracting young voters has upended the race. The Sanders campaign announced Sunday it had raised $20 million in January alone.
On the eve of the caucuses, Iowa was up for grabs. Given the stakes, both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns are offering some sharp assessments of the opposition.
Assessing the new tone, Matthew Dowd, a former strategist to President George W. Bush, said: ""It's been ratcheted up. Hillary understands that if she wins Iowa, she basically begins to end the race. Bernie realizes that the whole premise of his race is contingent on winning Iowa, and he's trying to do whatever he possibly can at this point to get over the hump.""
Spotlighting a vulnerability, Mr. Sanders is making the case that Mrs. Clinton is beholden to Wall Street. Speaking to reporters at a Bloomberg Politics breakfast last week, he mentioned that Mrs. Clinton had just attended a fundraising event at a Philadelphia investment firm.
""That's how she has raised money throughout her political career,"" he said. ""Millions of dollars from Wall Street and from other very powerful special interests.""
The combative posture poses risks for Mr. Sanders -- something his team acknowledges. He has pledged to usher in a more uplifting style of politics. He has said he would inspire voters and thus expand turnout on Election Day much as Barack Obama did eight years earlier.
Recognizing the potential damage to the Sanders brand, his aides say there are lines he won't cross: He won't air the classic political attack ad complete with ominous music and unflattering pictures of Mrs. Clinton.
""He's not going to go there; it's not in the cards,"" said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders campaign strategist.
So, instead, some of Mr. Sanders's ads leave it to voters to connect the dots. The latest spot features Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and its role in the 2008 financial collapse. No pictures of Mrs. Clinton's face appear in the ad; her name is never mentioned. Yet she is the star.
Mrs. Clinton and her husband have a long history of dealings with Goldman. Together, they have collected nearly $3 million in speaking fees from the company since 2005.
In the spot, a narrator says that ""millions in campaign contributions and speaking fees"" enabled Wall Street firms to engage in reckless practices.
In an interview with NBC News over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton said her opponent's method is to discredit her through ""insinuation and implication.""
""That's disappointing,"" she added, ""because he's always prided himself on being a candidate, a politician -- he's been in politics a really long time -- not to go negative.""
As the campaign unfolds Mr. Sanders has flashed increasing irritation at some of the criticism lodged by Team Clinton. Clinton allies have said that Mr. Sanders's socialist views would be exploited by Republicans in a general election.
On Sunday, Mr. Sanders tried to turn the tables. Asked by ABC News if he would get ""slapped"" with the socialist label should he win the party's nomination, he pointed to recent disclosures that top secret information passed through Mrs. Clinton's private email server.
Having memorably told Mrs. Clinton in a debate in October that Americans were ""sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,"" he said Sunday: ""Look at the front pages in terms of what Secretary Clinton is getting slapped with.""
Mrs. Clinton dismissed the latest controversy over her email as an ""interagency dispute"" that pales next to the larger issues on voters' minds.
For all the sparring, both campaigns are also taking pains to put out a positive message. But their core arguments are very different.
Mrs. Clinton says that her strength is persevering in the face of setbacks. A biographical video that plays for crowds ahead of her appearances ends with Mrs. Clinton saying, ""I don't quit"" -- a theme of her campaign since it launched last April. She says she has the experience and stamina to both accomplish her goals and beat the Republican nominee this fall.
Mr. Sanders is laying out a broader vision of a country that seeks to overturn a political system that favors the richest Americans.
He is calling for a bottom-up ""revolution"" that will compel Washington officials to act in the interests of a struggling middle class.
A huge rally he held Saturday in the college town of Iowa City captured the campaign's mood.
As he finished his remarks, the rock band Vampire Weekend took the stage and invoked an optimistic spirit of America at its best.
The band played Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land,"" and were joined by Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, who, together with the crowd sang along: ""From the redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters, this land was made for you and me.""

'C' Is for Corruption; The Clintons are the Brazilianization of American politics.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778227123?accountid=12768,"Postcards from yesterday's countries of the future:
Brazil: President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party faces impeachment on charges of cooking government books. Corruption investigations are ongoing in cases involving former President Lula da Silva and the presidents of both houses of Congress. Inflation is in double digits and the economy contracted by 3.8% last year.
In 2009, the Economist magazine praised Brazil for ""smart social policy and boosting consumption at home,"" predicting its economy would overtake Britain's after 2014.
Turkey: Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in Washington last week, where the Turkish president's security detail made diplomatic history by beating up protesters outside his speech at the Brookings Institution. A 2013 corruption scandal, implicating dozens of members of Mr. Erdogan's ruling AKP party, including two of his children, fizzled after the government purged 350 police officers investigating the affair.
In 2009, Hillary Clinton described Turkey as ""an emerging global power."" Financial Times columnist Philip Stephens (no relation) gushed that Turkey ""sets a powerful democratic example to the rest of the Muslim world.""
China: A leak of 11.5 million documents from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca--instantly dubbed ""the Panama Papers""--implicate relatives of President Xi Jinping along with other top officials of sheltering fortunes in offshore tax havens. Mr. Xi is supposed to be leading an anticorruption campaign.
In 2009, New York Times columnist Tom Friedman wrote of the ""great advantages"" of China's ""one-party autocracy,"" which he praised for being led by ""a reasonably enlightened group of people.""
The Panama Papers have also exposed billions in assets belonging to close friends of Vladimir Putin, which isn't surprising, along with revelations that the first lady of Iceland owned an offshore holding company, which sort of is. Other boldfaced names in this sludgy mix of shell companies include Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Argentine President Mauricio Macri, the children of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and even the late father of British Prime Minister David Cameron.
Everyone mentioned here denies wrongdoing, including the Mossack Fonseca firm--founded by the son of a onetime Waffen-SS officer who sought his fortune in Panama after the war. And everyone is entitled to a fair presentation of the facts, if necessary in court.
But nobody can be surprised by any of this. And nobody should look away from the central lesson of the scandal, though they're trying. To wit, the story here isn't about tax evaders and offshore accounts, deplorable as they may be. It's about public policies and incentives that make a career in politics an expedient route to personal enrichment.
The point is illustrated by Brazil, where state-owned oil giant Petrobras sits at the center of the multiplying corruption scandals. The former chairwoman of Petrobras was Ms. Rousseff, whose main qualification for the job--she's also a former Marxist guerrilla--was her reputation as an aggressive party hack. She has not been accused of using her position for personal enrichment, but Lula is under investigation for accepting Petrobras kickbacks in the form of a luxury apartment and other goodies. He denies the charges.
Meanwhile, Petrobras last year estimated its corruption-related losses at $17 billion. At least 57 Brazilians are being investigated for using Mossack Fonseca to open 107 offshore companies. Throughout all this, the ruling party's explicit economic agenda is to build ""national champions"" like Petrobras through the use of a state-owned ""development bank"" and other government subsidies.
What's true of Brazil is true of China, and of Russia, and of every other regime where political power or influence dictates the direction and pace of investment. That's why it was hard to take seriously a decade's worth of boosterism about the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) as the countries of the future. Kleptocracy is not a form of sustainable development.
***
Which brings us to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee and--if Republicans nominate either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz--likely the next president of the United States. Mrs. Clinton's email arrangements are supposed to be the scandal that will fell her, but what ought to frighten Americans is the way the Clintons mix money and power in the black box of their eponymous foundation to award themselves more of each.
This is the Brazilianization of American politics, albeit with more legal finessing. But the stench is the same, and it's why so many Americans, Democrats included, instinctively recoil at the thought of another Clinton presidency.
So far the Panama Papers seem to have netted few Americans, which may say something about the fundamental probity of the U.S. system. Nothing ordains that it should last forever. ""C"" is also for Clinton.

"Clinton, Sanders Collide At Debate",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762622704?accountid=12768,"DURHAM, N.H. -- The Democratic presidential candidates clashed Thursday night over who is the true progressive at their first one-on-one debate, with Hillary Clinton saying Sen. Bernie Sanders has put forward an unrealistic agenda that would ultimately collapse.
Mrs. Clinton spent much of the first hour defending her record, ideologically and in practice, after Mr. Sanders attacked her links to financial firms. ""What being part of the establishment is, is in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street,"" he said.
She termed Mr. Sanders's ""insinuation"" that Wall Street donations would keep her from adequately policing the industry an ""artful smear.""
A combative tone was set early on when Mrs. Clinton pushed back on Mr. Sanders's claim that she isn't a true ""progressive.""
""I'm not making promises that I cannot keep,"" Mrs. Clinton said, drawing a distinction between her self-described ability to get things done and Mr. Sanders's campaign proposals with numbers that she said ""just don't add up.""
The Vermont senator said Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, has at times described herself as a ""moderate"" who has a more incremental approach to solving economic problems that require bold action.
The candidates sparred over health care, the financial struggles of middle class families and the influence of Wall Street political donations.
The debate came five days before the primary in New Hampshire, where a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll shows Mr. Sanders maintains a comfortable lead. The fifth Democratic debate didn't include former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who dropped out of the race Monday after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, wrote in a stream of tweets on Wednesday that a genuine progressive wouldn't take millions of dollars in Wall Street donations, as Mrs. Clinton has done.
In the debate, he noted that in a campaign event last fall in Ohio, Mrs. Clinton said that ""I plead guilty"" to ""being kind of moderate and center.""
Mrs. Clinton chided him for ""cherry-picking"" quotes she had given, noting that more often she says she is a progressive who wants to get things done. She also accused Mr. Sanders of being the ""self-proclaimed gatekeeper of progressivism."" She said few Democrats would meet the standard he has set, including President Barack Obama who, she noted, also accepted campaign money from Wall Street.
She also said that under Mr. Sanders's definition, Vice President Joe Biden wouldn't be considered a progressive. His support for the Keystone XL pipeline would disqualify him, she indicated -- a statement that appeared at odds with what is known about the vice president's views.
The Obama administration rejected the pipeline last year, and as early as 2013, Mr. Biden reportedly told a supporter he opposed Keystone.
During the debate, a Clinton campaign aide said she misspoke in citing Keystone as the example for Mr. Biden. He would fail the progressive test, her campaign said, because he supports the Asian free-trade agreement and the death penalty.
After weeks in which Mr. Sanders has suggested that Mrs. Clinton is compromised because of Wall Street contributions and speaking fees, Mrs. Clinton hit back hard. ""Enough is enough. If you've got something to say, say it directly,"" she said.
She added that she is proud of the job she's done representing her constituents as a former New York senator. ""I think it's time to end a very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks,"" she said.
Mr. Sanders replied by speaking in general of contributions from pharmaceutical companies and oil companies, saying they get their way in Congress because of their donations. But he didn't cite anything in Mrs. Clinton's record.
""There is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system,"" he said. ""It is undermining American democracy.""
Mrs. Clinton countered by noting she's the one who is being attacked by special interests, in the past and during this campaign, and that she's introduced a comprehensive plan to change the way campaigns are financed. ""Today you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove who are running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you,"" she said.
One of the lingering questions in the race is whether Mrs. Clinton will face legal trouble stemming from an FBI investigation into her use of a private email system when she served as secretary of state.
Asked if she could reassure Democrats that no bombshell revelations were coming, she said yes, dismissing the entire exercise as partisan.
""Before it was emails, it was Benghazi,"" she says. ""I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever,"" noting that the government earlier on Thursday also accused former Secretary of State Colin Powell of receiving classified emails on a personal email account.
She added that she is ""100% confident"" that nothing would come of the FBI's investigation into her emails.
Mr. Sanders was also asked about Mrs. Clinton's emails, but refused to be drawn into an attack. He said there is a ""process under way"" and that he ""will not politicize it."" He added that ""not a day goes by"" when he's not asked to attack her on the email issue, and said he has declined.
On foreign policy, Mrs. Clinton was comfortable positioning herself to the right of Mr. Sanders. She cast him as naive for suggesting the U.S. should move aggressively toward normalizing relations with Iran.
""If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior,"" she said. ""The president doesn't think we should. I certainly don't think we should.""
Mr. Sanders pushed back, saying he doesn't support normalizing relations immediately but would like to work toward that goal. ""Please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We don't,"" he said. ""But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully someday that will happen.""
Noting her experience on the world stage, Mrs. Clinton pointed to a statement from a number of national-security experts that raised concerns about her rival's understanding of foreign affairs. ""I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief,"" she said.

"Clinton's Wall Street Dilemma --- Pushed by rival, Democratic front-runner struggles to justify money from the financial industry",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762622628?accountid=12768,"In the battle for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders is focused on turning Hillary Clinton's support from the financial industry, one of her longtime political assets, into a weapon against her.
Mr. Sanders has targeted Mrs. Clinton's close relationship with Wall Street, saying her history of taking money from big banks and hedge funds shows she isn't a progressive. The charge has helped Mr. Sanders gain traction with a Democratic electorate uneasy with the power of wealthy firms.
Mr. Sanders raised the Wall Street donations as the two traded barbs during a New Hampshire debate Thursday night, prompting Mrs. Clinton to defend herself. ""You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation I ever received,"" she said.
Mrs. Clinton, who has struggled to justify the money she has received from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other Wall Street firms over the years, had said Wednesday during a televised CNN candidate forum in New Hampshire that she accepted fees of more than $200,000 per speech because ""that's what they offered.""
Other prominent Democrats, including President Barack Obama in 2008, have combined a friendly relationship with the financial world with attacks on big-moneyed interests.
But no Democrat or Republican running for president this year has received as much money from Wall Street executives for their campaigns as Mrs. Clinton has. Wall Street is the top donor to her 2016 presidential campaign and to a super PAC run by Mrs. Clinton's allies to support her candidacy. Only the super PAC supporting Republican Jeb Bush has raised more on Wall Street.
More broadly, since Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton entered national politics in the early 1990s, Wall Street has contributed more than $100 million to their political campaigns, charitable foundation and personal finances, according to a review by The Wall Street Journal.
Financial-services firms accounted for about 12% of the total amount raised by the Clintons during their more than two decades in politics.
Some Wall Street money has helped the couple's personal finances. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other Wall Street firms have paid the Clintons more than $20 million in speaking fees over the years.
Many on Wall Street say they favor Mrs. Clinton because they agree with her on a range of topics -- and because they believe she will take their views into account if she pursues stepped-up regulations on financial services firms, according to interviews with more than two dozen executives.
Concerns over the nomination of either Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or New York businessman Donald Trump have prompted some Republicans on Wall Street to consider Mrs. Clinton as the better alternative. Many, however, say they are leaning toward Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who appeals to business-oriented Republicans.
Clinton aides dismiss talk that Mrs. Clinton is too cozy with the financial industry. ""She went to Wall Street before the crash and warned them that what they were doing could hurt the economy and called them out on it,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Thursday. ""She has introduced the strongest plan in this race . . . It actually deals with the swaps and derivatives that led to this crash.""
Mrs. Clinton's plan seeks to build on the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to strengthen oversight of the banking sector and unregulated ""shadow banking"" activities that played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis. She has also proposed a tax on certain types of high-frequency trading -- automated stock trading by computers that has been profitable but can cause excessive volatility -- and has pitched a so-called risk fee on the biggest financial firms.
Still, there is a general feeling that ""she's not going to come after Wall Street,"" said a Clinton super PAC donor who has spoken to dozens of potential supporters.
The widespread view on Wall Street, say executives, is that Mrs. Clinton, driven by pragmatic considerations, doesn't see financial firms as inherently bad and is willing to work on solutions.
Mrs. Clinton's supporters say she is able to push for higher middle-class incomes without demonizing the wealthy.
""Even for a lot of people on Wall Street, the concept of equality resonates,"" said David Lichtenstein, a real estate investor who hosted a fundraiser last month for Mrs. Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton's supporters say her campaign talk about reining in banks, curbing excessive risk-taking and punishing individuals for financial wrongdoing reflects a negative voter mood.
""She moved to the left because she needed some political cover in her fight against Sanders,"" said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at asset manager Horizon Investments. ""Her plan may be aggressive, but her ties to Wall Street make it unlikely that this proposal of hers will be a top priority . . . it's the cynical view.""
Clinton advisers said she would closely police Wall Street as president.
""People on Wall Street have been supporting her not because they think she's going to roll over on Wall Street, but because they agree with her on other issues outside of Wall Street,"" said Thomas Nides, a former deputy secretary of State under Mrs. Clinton and now vice chairman of Morgan Stanley.
While her husband's administration was stocked with Wall Street veterans, the Clintons' connections with the finance community grew in 1999, when they bought a home in Chappaqua, an affluent suburb of New York City.
At the time, Mrs. Clinton and her husband were linked with a centrist, pro-business wing of the Democratic Party that didn't seek to alienate Wall Street. Supporters described them as a celebrity couple, charming New York's financial community and blending into summers in the Hamptons, the Long Island community of beach towns where many rich New Yorkers keep homes.
""He was the former president and she was the former first lady,"" Mr. Nides said. ""She was already a well-known commodity, and people wanted to be with her.""
As the couple expanded their Wall Street network, hedge-fund managers, bankers and wealthy investors wrote checks to the Clinton Foundation philanthropy and agreed to host fundraisers in their homes for Mrs. Clinton's budding political career. Many were pleasantly surprised to receive handwritten thank-you notes, flowers or phone calls from the couple.
Now, engaged in a presidential primary, Mrs. Clinton is finding these relationships, so helpful in the past, a point of vulnerability.
In the run-up to Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders has sharpened his attacks on Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street. At campaign stops around the state, he paints her as an establishment figure incapable of overhauling the political system to benefit everyday American families.
Campaign finance reports made public this week show Mrs. Clinton leads all others in financial support from Wall Street. Through the end of 2015, Wall Street had donated $2.9 million to Mrs. Clinton's election campaign and $55,226 to the campaign of Mr. Sanders.
Among Republicans, Wall Street donors have contributed a total of about $2 million to Messrs. Cruz, Rubio and Trump.
A super PAC run by Mrs. Clinton's supporters has collected an additional $14.3 million from Wall Street, a total surpassed only by the super PAC set up to back Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor. Mr. Sanders doesn't have a major super PAC supporting his campaign; a super PAC run by a nurses union has spent nearly $1 million on his behalf.
Overall, Wall Street accounted for about a third of the funds the Clinton super PAC raised last year. Billionaire investor George Soros gave the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action, $6 million in December, bringing his total donations to the group to $7 million.
The newly released campaign finance filings show Mrs. Clinton raised the most money among the presidential candidates from just about every industry tracked by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
In all, donations from the financial-services sector make up a large and growing share of the amount of money raised in U.S. elections. Through the end of 2015, money from financial services firms made up roughly 40% of the $1 billion donated so far into the 2016 election, compared with less than 20% of the total in 2012 and 5% in 2008.

"Election 2016: Clinton, Sanders Sharpen Their Rhetoric --- Democrats spar over who is 'progressive' and the senator's edge in a neighboring state",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762314534?accountid=12768,"DERRY, N.H. -- Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders stepped up their attacks before they meet for a one-on-one debate Thursday, campaigning aggressively in a state that her campaign says she may not be able to win.
Trailing by double digits in New Hampshire polls, Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday rejected suggestions that she look past the state and focus instead on friendlier territory, as both campaigns sharpened their tones and sparred from afar.
Mr. Sanders jabbed first on Tuesday when he said the former senator and secretary of state is a progressive on some days. ""Except when she announces she's a moderate,"" he added. ""Then she's not a progressive.""
Mrs. Clinton responded at a get-out-the-vote event, calling her opponent's comments a ""low blow"" and saying she has delivered results for progressives. She said the race should focus on issues, but added that ""if it's about our records, hey, I'm going to win by a landslide.""
The squabble over which candidate is more progressive ramped up online with a series of tweets from Mr. Sanders's account, including a long list of more moderate policy positions that Mrs. Clinton has taken in the past.
The two Democrats continued to parse the definition of progressive during a town hall event Wednesday night. Mr. Sanders noted that the former secretary of state has described herself as a moderate in the past.
""You can't be a moderate and a progressive -- they are different,"" Mr. Sanders said.
When Mrs. Clinton took the stage, she said she was amused that her rival had cast himself as a gatekeeper determining who is a progressive. ""I don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons,"" she said.
Earlier, Mrs. Clinton's campaign suggested that Mr. Sanders has built-in advantages in New Hampshire because he represents neighboring Vermont. Mr. Sanders parried, saying New Hampshire voters are serious about their role in the nominating process and that ""to repeatedly suggest otherwise is an insult"" to them.
Mr. Sanders said on CNN that the Clinton campaign is financed by Wall Street and big-money interests. Mrs. Clinton countered by critiquing her rival's health-care plan.
This intensifying tit-for-tat is playing out in a state where Mrs. Clinton is a decided long-shot. A Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Mr. Sanders with an 18-percentage-point advantage in Tuesday's primary, and some have suggested Mrs. Clinton should focus her resources on the states that will vote shortly after New Hampshire.
""Not on your life,"" Mrs. Clinton told supporters Wednesday. ""I would never quit on New Hampshire.""
The Clinton campaign has tried to lower expectations in recent days, saying that Mrs. Clinton's 2008 come-from-behind win in New Hampshire is unlikely to be replicated. Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton's communications director, said Mr. Sanders has a substantial lead but that the former secretary of state would stay in New Hampshire through the primary, trying to build support.
""We don't know that we can win, but she is going to be here every day,"" Ms. Palmieri said.
The Sanders campaign pushed back against the Clinton team's attempts to play down her prospects. ""They're overplaying their hand on this 'He's a neighbor' stuff,' "" said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders campaign strategist. ""Our view is we're up against the whole establishment again.""
The battle for New Hampshire and the tonal shift in the Democratic campaign come on the heels of a hard-fought contest in Iowa that saw Mrs. Clinton eke out a razor-thin win.
Some Democratic strategists said Mrs. Clinton remains in a stronger position for the long term. With the race soon moving to states with higher percentages of minority voters, Mrs. Clinton stands to do better, they said. Steve McMahon, a longtime Democratic consultant, said the Iowa result ""helped Bernie, but it wasn't enough of a 'Voila!' moment to change the dynamic in South Carolina and Nevada.""
Mr. Sanders is telling supporters that the political establishment is growing nervous about his staying power. Winning the nomination won't be easy, the senator said, but he noted that in Iowa he took on the ""most powerful political organization in the country.""
For her part, Mrs. Clinton is positioning herself as a fighter, not a front-runner, and is quick to remind voters that she is running against a ""neighbor."" She urges, ""New Hampshire, come with me.""

Election 2016: Clinton Takes Campaign Detour to Meet Flint Voters,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762943738?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton left New Hampshire Sunday to travel to the besieged city of Flint, Mich., promising to help the community work through a water crisis however she can -- and perhaps boost her campaign with a critical set of voters.
""I will fight for you no matter how long it takes,"" Mrs. Clinton said to a cheering congregation at the House of Prayer Missionary Baptist Church just minutes after they took communion. ""This is for me a personal commitment. I will stand with you every step of the way.""
Her address combined prayer -- she opened with a verse from Psalms -- with policy and a call to action, as she addressed a predominantly African-American audience struggling in the aftermath of a crisis that left the city's water supply poisoned with lead.
She also said she is pushing Congress to approve $200 million in federal aid for the city. Senate Republicans balked last week at the additional funds.
The trip meant she missed most of Sunday in New Hampshire, two days before its first-in-the-nation primary.
Two surveys this weekend put Sen. Bernie Sanders's lead over Mrs. Clinton at about 10 percentage points, but others have it much higher. She appeared at a Dunkin' Donuts and on Sunday talk shows before departing New Hampshire. Mr. Sanders, too, left the state Saturday to appear on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" in New York.
The Clinton campaign concluded that the time away from the Granite State was well worth it.
Even if Sanders wins in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton holds a strong advantage with African-American and Hispanic voters who are important in states to come, and her trip to Flint was meant to reinforce her argument that she is a doer who finds ways to solve problems.
Over the last few weeks, Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly drawn attention to the situation in Flint, sending a top aide there and pushing for a coming debate with Mr. Sanders to be staged there.
To save money, the city of Flint began using the Flint River as its water source in April 2014, but the corrosive waters ate away at pipes and leached lead into Flint's water supply.
State officials initially dismissed complaints by residents and outside researchers who said tainted water was causing elevated blood lead levels in children.
Mrs. Clinton followed her public address with a closed-door meeting with 21 community leaders, including the mayor, Karen Weaver, who credited Mrs. Clinton's attention to the issue with helping to get the city the help it needs.
""The heat was on, but you turned the heat up,"" Ms. Weaver told the former secretary of state at the top of the meeting. ""She came when no one else would.""
Residents at the event said her visit was good for them and, potentially, for her.
""I think she has genuine compassion,"" said Carol Gardner, 60 years old, who tidied up pews after the event and pointed out the likely power of the Flint water issue at the ballot box. ""If she didn't campaign on it, that wouldn't be good politics,"" she added.
At Hutchinson Food & Drug, just down the road from the church, Cynthia Howell packed her sport-utility vehicle with groceries for a Super Bowl party and said it was fine with her if Mrs. Clinton scored some political points.
""If you're going to use us, we're going to use you,"" said the 59-year-old community advocate, who was born and raised in Flint. ""Everybody has an agenda.""

"Election 2016 -- Analysis: Clinton, Sanders Pitches: Doer or Dreamer",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762768256?accountid=12768,"Thursday night's Democratic debate in New Hampshire was the clearest illustration yet of how the party's presidential race is now defined: It is a battle between a doer and a dreamer.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton portrays herself as the doer. She stressed her experience, her desire to set achievable goals and her ability to work the system successfully to achieve them. There are limits to what can be done, she seemed to be saying, and it is better to work all the way to those limits rather than play Don Quixote, tilting at windmills, and ultimately fail.
""Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do,"" she said. ""A progressive is someone who makes progress. That's what I intend to do.""
Sen. Bernie Sanders plays the role of the dreamer. If the system sets limits, he argued, don't accept the limits, but instead smash the system.
Wage a political ""revolution"" -- a word he uses without reservation, and repeatedly -- for government-guaranteed health care for all, for free college education, for a giant leap in the minimum wage.
And he has a simple unifying theory of why this all hasn't happened already: a ""corrupt"" campaign-finance system that allows corporate interests who would lose in a changed world to stand in the way. Change campaign finance and all becomes possible.
""What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors,"" he said. ""When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.""
The sheer simplicity of the Sanders message is what gives it its greatest appeal to frustrated older voters and idealistic younger ones. Yet it also was clear Thursday night that the simplicity of it also is what exasperates Mrs. Clinton.
She described herself more as a battle-scarred veteran who has learned the hard way that it is best to do the work without, as she said, ""making promises that I cannot keep.""
So her goal is to make college more affordable, not to promise that it can be free. She wants to expand and improve the health-care law known as Obamacare, not toss it aside in pursuit of some dubious goal of Medicare for all.
At one point she argued that she has the ability to work together with Republicans and independents to achieve such things: ""We'll get things done together.""
Mr. Sanders said his approach wouldn't be to negotiate compromise with, say, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell but rather to bring an army of citizens to his doorstep to make him accept their demands.
""No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell,"" he said. ""Mitch is going to have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, 'Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.' ""
The Sanders approach seemed to put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive during the first part of the debate. But the tables turned later, when the discussion turned to national security, as she painted his approach as not idealistic but rather dangerously naive.
That area is where she, as the nation's former top foreign-policy cabinet official, is the more nimble candidate.
She argued that it is a mistake to suppose, as Mr. Sanders has suggested, that it would be acceptable to invite Iranian troops into Syria to help police put an end to the civil war there, or to fully normalize relations with Iran more broadly.
""If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior,"" she said. Better to ""take this step by step to try to rein in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.""
On that front, she got Mr. Sanders to argue that he, too, could be realistic, and that he was talking of normalizing relations eventually, not immediately.
Overall, though, Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire and beyond have two quite different approaches to choose between: a candidate who stresses achievement and one who prefers aspirations.

Verizon's Political Strike; Sanders and Clinton join picket lines on behalf of the rotary-phone era.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780668568?accountid=12768,"As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders chase each other further to the left, it was only a matter of time before somebody decided to capitalize on their competition. The Democrats have now helped inspire the largest domestic strike in years--and it's pure political performance art.
On Wednesday, more than 36,000 Verizon workers on the East Coast walked off the job after their unions rejected the telecom's latest contract offer in a 10-month negotiation. The Communication Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers wanted a public spectacle, and did they ever get one.
Mr. Sanders joined a picket line in Brooklyn and began, ""Brothers and sisters, thank you for your courage and standing up for justice against corporate greed."" He went on to accuse Verizon of ""trying to destroy the lives of working Americans,"" and that was the subtle part. Mrs. Clinton demanded that the company ""do the right thing"" and tender ""a fair offer to their workers.""
The Democrats are not exactly Bobby Kennedy communing with Cesar Chavez and destitute grape pickers. How's this for ""fair""? The walk-offs enjoy an average annual pay and benefits package of $130,000. Management is offering a 6.5% cash wage increase, the same health coverage as its other domestic employees and an industry-competitive 401(k) match.
Yet Verizon and the unions have largely agreed about compensation. The unions preferred to make a political statement about expanding the ranks of the Americans lucky enough to have decent-paying jobs, which apparently means showing solidarity with an increasingly obsolete business model.
Some 99% of the strikers work for Verizon's legacy ""wireline"" business, or its traditional fixed phone service plus its fiber optic Internet service. This unit generates only 7% of Verizon operating income, down from 60% in 2000--wireless is more profitable--and as more customers ditch land lines, it is only natural that these old-fashioned networks will require fewer workers to operate and maintain.
But Verizon isn't even looking to shed jobs. It is merely seeking more flexibility to manage its workforce, such as consolidating under-used call centers and the ability to hire more outside contractors. ""Nostalgia for the rotary-phone era won't save American jobs,"" Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam wrote in a LinkedIn post.
Mr. McAdam also called Mr. Sanders's rhetoric ""contemptible,"" publishing a detailed rebuttal. Credit is due to the rare executive willing to defend economic reality and stand up to political intimidation.",2016-04-14
Clinton's False Email Equivalence,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762768058?accountid=12768,"A week ago Hillary Clinton's allies accused the State Department Inspector General's office of belonging to the vast right-wing conspiracy. So you have to admire her chutzpah this week in trying to spin a memo from that same office to exonerate her use of a renegade private email server. All the more so because the new memo strengthens the case that she mishandled national secrets.
In Thursday's Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton hailed a new document from State IG Steve Linick that summarizes his view of the email practices of five prior Secretaries of State. The memo says he found a few instances of ""sensitive material"" sent to the private email accounts of Republicans Colin Powell and staffers to Condoleezza Rice.
""Now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing [to Powell and Rice's aides] they've been doing to me,"" claimed Mrs. Clinton -- that is, ""retroactively classifying"" documents. ""I agree with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity.""
Ah, yes, the old everybody-does-it defense. Mrs. Clinton wants Americans to believe it was common practice for top diplomats to use private email, and that they are all now subject to overzealous interagency squabbling over classification. By Friday Democrats were spinning that Mrs. Clinton is a political victim for having been singled out. Her media phalanx is buying this line, though the Powell and Rice details prove the opposite -- and how reckless Mrs. Clinton was by comparison.
Start with the fact that neither Mr. Powell nor Ms. Rice set up a private email server to conduct government business. Mr. Powell did have a personal email account, but he purposely used a State-maintained classified computer system on his desk for classified communications. This may not have been ""convenient"" for him, to borrow an earlier Clinton explanation for her private server, but Mr. Powell understood the rules. And he understood them even prior to 2005 when State instituted clear rules warning against private email for official business. Mrs. Rice's aides say she never used any email while at State.
While a few sensitive details may have leeched into a Powell or Rice-aide email account, these would have been accidental. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton intentionally created a private email account, on her own private server, precisely so she could keep those emails away from government public-disclosure rules.
Mr. Linik's review turned up two messages sent to Mr. Powell's account that State now deems sensitive (though Mr. Powell disputes that they should be classified). Mr. Linik found 10 that were sent to Ms. Rice's State Department entourage over her entire tenure. By contrast, State has now deemed that more than 1,600 emails on Mrs. Clinton's server are confidential -- and there is another batch still to be released.
The federal government maintains several levels of classification, ranging from the lowest designations of ""sensitive but unclassified"" and ""confidential"" to code-word classifications for the most important secrets. While all such information must be safeguarded, lower-level ""sensitive but unclassified"" and ""confidential"" information is sometimes circulated on unclassified government systems. Mr. Powell points out that the two emails sent to him were first circulated on unclassified State Department systems and forwarded to his account by an assistant.
Many of Mrs. Clinton's 1,600 classified emails also fall into these ""sensitive"" and ""confidential"" categories. But at least 22 emails have been identified as highly classified from their creation. This means that their information would have resided at all times on classified government systems until they were sent to Mrs. Clinton and her unclassified, unguarded private server. There is no evidence that anything remotely like that happened under Secretaries Powell or Rice.
This transfer question gets to the heart of Mrs. Clinton's email negligence. Sen. Dianne Feinstein is defending Mrs. Clinton by claiming there is no evidence that any of these top secrets emails originated with Secretary Clinton. ""It has never made sense to me that Secretary Clinton can be held responsible for email exchanges that originated with someone else,"" the California Democrat says.
But Mrs. Clinton is responsible because she is the one who created the classification problem by doing official business on her private server. This would never have become an issue if she had followed the rules and used State Department email. That she set up her private email out of a self-serving desire to shield her communications from public disclosure makes her disregard for security a willful act that opens her to criminal liability.
Readers of a certain age will recall that another Clinton tried the everybody-does-it defense when he was found to have broken the law. Are Democrats really going to lash themselves one more time to the Clinton standard of ethics?",2016-04-14
Election 2016: Clinton Plans for Tough Caucuses,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763312967?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Hillary Clinton's campaign strategists look at the primary calendar and see possible losses ahead -- not just on Tuesday in New Hampshire, where they are bracing for a double-digit defeat, but in caucus states that typically favor the candidate who draws support from liberal activists.
The key, they say, is not to lose too badly.
Clinton officials say their campaign has been quietly organizing in the coming caucus states such as Minnesota and Colorado, and Mrs. Clinton plans to travel to both later this week. Their goal is to prevent rival Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, from running up an advantage in delegates as Barack Obama did in 2008.
The campaign also is making thousands of calls each night into these states, and has loaded them up with staff, believing field organizers are particularly effective in states that require motivating a relatively small number of people to attend what is essentially a Democratic Party meeting.
One of the Clinton campaign's goals is to force Mr. Sanders to spend time in the caucus states that he may think he has in hand, a Clinton aide said, and perhaps have less time in states where Mrs. Clinton has the advantage.
Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, also worked on her 2008 campaign, and recalls that Mrs. Clinton won a hard-fought battle in Ohio by 10 percentage points, but because it was a primary state she netted only seven additional delegates over Mr. Obama, then a senator. But in the much smaller Idaho caucuses, Mrs. Clinton barely competed and Mr. Obama won 15 delegates to her 3.
""That can't happen again,"" Mr. Mook said. ""We're building to win these contests but even if we don't win, we need to set it up so we're winning enough delegates to keep our overall delegate lead where it needs to be.""

Clinton's U.N. Candidate?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763312846?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton has made gender a major part of her pitch for the White House, and the idea is catching on. A leading candidate to become the next Secretary-General of the United Nations is a Bulgarian woman with a Communist past and a record unfriendly to U.S. interests who is being promoted by Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law.
The Bulgarian is 63-year-old Irina Bokova, who since 2009 has run Unesco, the U.N. cultural and social welfare agency. By tradition the top job at the U.N., Secretary-General, rotates by region and it will be Eastern Europe's turn when Ban Ki-moon's term expires at the end of this year. The Bulgarian government may nominate her for the post, which given her U.N. experience would make her the favorite unless significant opposition develops.
Ms. Bokova deserves more scrutiny, not least because of her record at Unesco. Long-time Journal readers will recall that the U.S. withdrew from Unesco in 1984 after years of anti-American agitation. The U.S. rejoined in 2003 saying the agency had reformed.
But in 2011 under Ms. Bokova, Unesco tried to make an end run around the Middle East peace process by admitting the Palestinian Authority as a member state despite U.S. objections. Mrs. Clinton's State Department was then forced by U.S. law to cut off the roughly $80 million in annual U.S. funding for Unesco.
That law reflects Congress's view that U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state before there is a peace deal with Israel encourages the Palestinians to avoid direct negotiations. The cutoff probably stopped other U.N. agencies from recognizing a Palestinian state lest they also lose U.S. funds. But President Obama opposes the funding cutoff and in December asked Congress to reconsider. It declined.
We can't find a record of Mrs. Clinton's views on Unesco funding, but she's no doubt aware of Ms. Bokova, who has participated in Clinton Global Initiative events. Ms. Bokova is also friendly with women's-rights activist Marjorie Margolies, a former Democratic Member of Congress who is a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government -- and Chelsea's mother-in-law. On Tuesday after Ms. Bokova delivers a lecture at the Fels Institute, she and Ms. Margolies will share a stage for a ""conversation"" and ""Q&A"" with the audience.
The following day former Ambassador Esther Coopersmith will host a dinner for Ms. Bokova in Washington ""to learn more about her candidacy for Secretary General of the United Nations,"" as the invitation puts it. Washingtonian magazine reported in December 2013 that Ms. Coopersmith ""is close to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.""
The Economist reports that Ms. Bokova is also ""Russia's preferred candidate."" Last year she attended Vladimir Putin's Moscow Victory Day Parade, the biggest military display in Russian history. Most Western leaders refused to attend Mr. Putin's extravaganza in protest over his depredations in Ukraine. But Ms. Bokova was on hand with the likes of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Cuba's Raul Castro.
Ms. Bokova was an active member of the Bulgarian Communist Party in the Cold War era, and her father edited the Party's house organ. She graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1976 when talented students were dispatched to the institute to become good Communist diplomats. And she remained a member of the Communist Party until it changed its name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party.
It's true that the Cold War ended long ago, and many former Communists in the former Warsaw Pact have become democrats in good standing. But authoritarians are again on the march in the world, Mr. Putin chief among them. As U.N. Secretary-General, Ms. Bokova would have global influence and could create trouble for the U.S. All the more so in a Hillary Clinton Administration that would want U.N. approval and consensus for its diplomatic undertakings.
If the next Secretary-General must be a woman from Eastern Europe, there is a better alternative. Kristalina Georgieva is currently a vice president at the European Commission and has worked at the World Bank. Though she isn't our ideal candidate -- her fans include George Soros -- she lacks Ms. Bokova's political baggage. The current center-right government in Sofia might nominate Ms. Georgieva if there's global opposition to Ms. Bokova.
The U.S. role is crucial here. No Secretary-General is likely to be approved if America is actively opposed. Mr. Obama is leaving town in 11 months, and the next President will need a U.N. leader who isn't hostile to American interests. We'd like to know where Mrs. Clinton stands on Ms. Bokova's candidacy, and the House and Senate may want to examine her record in Bulgaria and at Unesco.",2016-04-15
Election 2016: Results Point to Clinton's Weaknesses,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764093428?accountid=12768,"Democrats in the first two presidential nominating contests have delivered a clear message to Hillary Clinton about her weaknesses as a candidate. She isn't considered trustworthy, and her message of competence and experience isn't sufficiently compelling.
About a quarter of Iowa's Democratic caucus-goers last week said the quality they most wanted in a nominee was honesty and trustworthiness. Among that group, voter surveys showed, Mrs. Clinton won a mere 10%.
The verdict was more severe in New Hampshire on Tuesday. One-third of voters said they most wanted honesty in a nominee, and Mrs. Clinton carried 5% of those voters.
The results in part reflect the months of controversy Mrs. Clinton generated by using a private email system during her time as secretary of state, questions about her family's charitable foundation, as well as speaking fees she earned from Wall Street firms that are a favorite target of liberal Democrats.
Mrs. Clinton left the Obama administration in early 2013 with a positive image, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling shows. But by last month, some 40% of registered voters viewed her unfavorably while a larger share -- 49% -- saw her in a negative light.
The results from Iowa and New Hampshire also signaled that Mrs. Clinton has yet to fashion an argument for her candidacy as powerful as the liberal vision laid out by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders promises to end a ""corrupt"" campaign-finance system that he says allows the wealthy and Wall Street buy influence and rig the economy in their favor.
Mrs. Clinton also has laid out liberal goals, but her candidacy also rests on her long experience in public life and the argument that she would make the stronger general election candidate. In New Hampshire, however, Democratic primary voters said they most wanted a nominee who was ""honest"" and ""cares about people like me.""
Some 60% of voters chose one of those two qualities, exit polls showed, and Mr. Sanders carried both groups by lopsided margins.
By contrast, 38% said experience or the ability to win in November was the most important quality in a nominee. Mrs. Clinton won those groups by large margins, exit polls showed.
Mr. Sanders's message is exciting his core supporters more than Mrs. Clinton is energizing her base. She carried her strongest voting group, women age 45 and older, by seven percentage points in New Hampshire, 53% to 46%, exit polls showed.
Mr. Sanders, by contrast, posted prohibitively large margins among the groups that most responded to his message. Some three-quarters of Democratic primary voters under age 45 backed him in New Hampshire, including 83% of voters under 30.
Young women, who many presumed would be part of the Clinton coalition, are instead turning to Mr. Sanders. He carried women under age 45 by 40 percentage points in New Hampshire, 69% to 29%.
While Iowa and New Hampshire proved to be unexpectedly difficult tests for Mrs. Clinton, the race now moves to states that could prove to be friendlier terrain. The first contests took place in two of the most liberal and least racially diverse states in the nation. Next come states with larger shares of minority and centrist voters, who in opinion surveys have favored Mrs. Clinton.

"Trump, Sanders Roll in N.H. --- Clinton Defeat Prompts Retooling",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764093396?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Bernie Sanders soundly defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, propelled by independents and young voters wary about the economy and skeptical that the next generation of Americans will live a better life.
Once considered a fringe candidate who stood little chance against Mrs. Clinton, the Vermont senator pulled off a sweeping victory. With more than half of New Hampshire's precincts reporting, Mr. Sanders had 60% of the vote compared with 39% for Mrs. Clinton. The Associated Press called the race for Mr. Sanders at 8 p.m. ET.
Mr. Sanders defeated Mrs. Clinton among women and swept all age categories except voters over 65, surveys of voters as they exited polling precincts showed. The result underscored the appeal of Mr. Sanders's argument that billionaire families and powerful companies are rigging the economy against the American middle class.
At the same time, Mrs. Clinton's defeat suggested that her central message isn't resonating and that she can't count on voters to choose her because of her years of experience as a first lady, senator and secretary of state. Only 27% of Democratic voters said it was important that candidates have the ""right experience,"" exit surveys showed.
Mr. Sanders, in his victory speech, told supporters they had sent a message that would echo from Wall Street to Washington. ""The government of our great country belongs to all of the people, and not just wealthy campaign contributors and their super PACs,"" he said.
Mr. Sanders, whose win Tuesday was powered by high turnout, predicted that result would be repeated across the nation.
Mrs. Clinton, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2008, declared that, ""I still love New Hampshire and I always will."" And seeking to use the defeat to show she is a fighter, she promised to take the battle to other states and said, ""It is not whether you get knocked down that matters, it is whether you get back up.""
Even before the primary, Mrs. Clinton began retooling her message and said she would reexamine her campaign strategy in hopes of blunting Mr. Sanders's momentum.
Mr. Sanders made deep inroads with voters outside the mainstream of Democratic politics. About 40% of those taking part in the Democratic primary were independents, and Mr. Sanders prevailed among those by a commanding 72% to 27%, the exit polls showed. The two candidates split self-identified Democrats evenly, according to the polls.
Voters were clearly receptive to Mr. Sanders's populist message. Only 27% described themselves as politically moderate, while 69% called themselves liberal -- a dynamic that could change as the race moves to states with more centrist Democratic voters.
Asked if the economic system in America favors the wealthy, 90% of Democratic voters said yes, the exit polls showed. And by a margin of nearly 4 to 1, voters said they trusted Mr. Sanders more than Mrs. Clinton to deal with income inequality.
Lisa Colavito, a nurse from Concord, said she voted for Mr. Sanders ""because we need to get the money out of politics."" She added, ""He's a grassroots candidate, he stands by his word, and he's been consistent.""
Ms. Colavito said she wasn't persuaded by the prospect that Mrs. Clinton could be the first female president. ""I just want a person that's good for the job,"" she said.
Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had expected her to be in a stronger position at this point in the race, people familiar with their thinking said.
One person familiar with internal discussions said that inside the Clinton campaign, there is debate over two points. The first is how hard Mrs. Clinton herself should attack Mr. Sanders. Among those advocating a sharper tone is her husband, who himself went after Mr. Sanders in sharp terms last weekend.
The second question is whether she should reshape the way she describes her vision, away from the policy-heavy speeches she is most comfortable with, where she projects herself as an effective pragmatist, and toward a more lofty, visionary message.
Mrs. Clinton's aides, at her election-night gathering, said that in coming weeks she would emphasize social-justice issues, going beyond what they see as Mr. Sanders's narrower focus on economic justice.
Next up for the Democrats are caucuses in Nevada, a state with more minority voters than Iowa or New Hampshire. That would give Mrs. Clinton, who has wide support in minority communities, a chance to rebound and demonstrate that she has more broad-based national support than the senator from Vermont.
First, though, she needs to come up with a more compelling rationale for her candidacy, many Clinton allies say. While Mrs. Clinton has put forward a mix of policy proposals, her supporters say he has yet to lay out a succinct explanation of why she wants to be president.
By contrast, Mr. Sanders has steadily gained ground with a message that is apparently resonating with young voters in particular: Billionaires and powerful corporations are corrupting the political system and making it harder for middle-class Americans to get ahead.
Now, campaign aides say, Mrs. Clinton is beginning to give voice to a message that is more positive, personal and even spiritual, talking about concepts like gratitude and the need to move forward in life.
""The problem is that she needs an overarching message other than 'I'm almost as far left as Bernie but not quite,' "" said Douglas Schoen, a former adviser to Mr. Clinton. ""She has to answer the basic question of why she wants to be president. So far she hasn't done that.""
In the run-up to Tuesday's New Hampshire balloting, both Mrs. Clinton and her husband have suggested they are open to a course correction.
The ex-president is frustrated by his wife's slow start and unhappy she isn't polling better with female voters, people familiar with his thinking said. In an interview with MSNBC on the eve of the primary, Mrs. Clinton said: ""Of course it would be malpractice not to say, 'OK, what worked? What can we do better? What do we have to do new and different that we have to pull out?' ""
But Mrs. Clinton's experience makes it challenging for her to present a sweeping vision for change, something for which voters have shown an appetite.
Mrs. Clinton had what her aides saw as a revealing and helpful moment at a CNN forum last week, where she was asked by a rabbi how she balances the need to make a difference in the world and the need for humility.
She replied with a nuanced, spiritual and personal explanation of the need to practice what she called ""the discipline of gratitude.""
""So regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful,"" she said. ""Be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe. Be grateful for your limitations. Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you. Listen to your critics, answer the questions.""
Her aides are keen to find ways to incorporate those types of thoughts into her speeches, and over the course of the past several days, in fits and starts, a new message emerged.
Still, with Mrs. Clinton having been on the national stage for a quarter century, it isn't clear that voters who have been cool to her will give her a second look.
Mike Perry, a resident of Laconia, N.H., said Tuesday he planned to cast his vote for Mr. Sanders. ""I like what he's offering,"" he said. ""He wants to make changes, and that's what I want to hear.""
Mr. Perry said he didn't want to elaborate about his feelings about Mrs. Clinton, but that he strongly believed she wasn't the right candidate for the job. ""I don't like her,"" he said. ""I just don't.""

Election 2016: Clinton Seeks to Maximize Her Support Among Blacks,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764828520?accountid=12768,"DENMARK, S.C. -- Hillary Clinton is running to end ""the cruelest kind of indifference"" to those left behind in America, she said during a visit to a poor rural community here, which also is home to one of rival Bernie Sanders's best-known black supporters in this critical primary state.
At a town-hall meeting at Denmark-Olar Elementary School, Mrs. Clinton sought to draw attention to underfunded schools that are emblematic of a system that refuses to see the ""left behind and left out.""
It is ""fundamentally wrong"" that the state had still not resolved a funding lawsuit filed 20 years ago by some of the local school districts, where building walls are crumbling, rooms are molding, roofs are collapsing, Mrs. Clinton said.
""If the schools had been falling apart in rich suburbs of Columbia or Charleston, we wouldn't still be talking about it,"" she said. ""I'm running for president to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people achieving their dreams.""
Denmark, in rural Bamberg County, is normally not a hotspot for presidential visits; it has a population of 3,300 and shrinking, is more than 85% black and has a household median income less than half the national average.
Mrs. Clinton's visit to Denmark is part of an effort to maximize her historic strength among black voters when pitted against Mr. Sanders in the Feb. 27 Democratic primary.
Black voters are expected to make up more than half of the primary electorate here, and Mrs. Clinton is relying on a victory here to regain momentum after her narrow win in the Iowa caucuses and big loss in New Hampshire.
Mrs. Clinton was once thought to have a lock on the primary here. But in the past few weeks, some prominent black preachers and legislators here have come out in support of Mr. Sanders, including local Bamberg Rep. Justin Bamberg, who formerly endorsed Mrs. Clinton but switched to Mr. Sanders because of his focus on criminal-justice issues.
Mr. Bamberg, a 28-year-old first-term legislator, said he was trying not to take the visit personally. He said that he hoped Mrs. Clinton's visit to the school drew attention to the recent closing of two area hospitals, as well as to a lack of jobs.
Bakari Sellers, a 31-year-old CNN political commentator who formerly held Mr. Bamberg's legislative seat, introduced Mrs. Clinton at the rally. In an interview, he said her visit had nothing to do with Mr. Bamberg.
Mr. Sellers said that Mrs. Clinton has been working on behalf of the people of Bamberg before either he or Mr. Bamberg was born. Mrs. Clinton came to Bamberg County once before -- as a lawyer in the 1970s working with incarcerated teenagers for the Children's Defense Fund.
Her work on issues related to the poor and minorities is a primary reason the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington endorsed Mrs. Clinton this week. But some Sanders backers bristle at the expectation that black voters should get in lock-step.
Joe Neal, a Columbia pastor and former head of the Legislative Black Caucus, said that he is campaigning for Mr. Sanders because of his stance on mass incarceration, the minimum wage and income inequality.

Clinton's Negative Majority; She's getting more unpopular the longer the campaign goes on.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782004240?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton won New York's primary Tuesday, which means that barring an act of God or FBI director Jim Comey--they aren't the same--she will be the Democratic nominee for President. So Democrats should be alarmed by the former first lady's rising unpopularity.
The latest evidence comes in the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken April 10-14. A regular feature of this survey asks voters about their ""feelings toward"" certain individuals or institutions--whether they are very positive, somewhat positive, neutral, somewhat negative or very negative. In April the poll found Mrs. Clinton hitting a dubious new record of 56% who have somewhat or very negative feelings toward her. Only 32% have a positive view.
As striking is the negative trend over the last three years. In Jan. 2013, not long after she left President Obama's cabinet, her net negative was 25%. As the nearby chart shows, her unpopularity has since climbed with only occasional exceptions. She broke through negative 40% in the middle of last year, and she hit negative 50% in February. In April a remarkable 42% had a very negative view of the woman Democrats are counting on to hold the White House.
Some of this is explainable by the pounding any candidate takes during a campaign. Bernie Sanders has been portraying Mrs. Clinton as a tool of the big banks, even if he's ducked her serious ethical problems. But what should worry Democrats is that Bill Clinton's wife has been a national political figure since 1992, and her political identity is well known and will be hard to change.
All of which means Republicans should be poised to retake the White House in November if they nominate someone remotely tolerable. Yet they may not. Donald Trump reinforced his GOP front-runner status Tuesday with a blowout victory in his home state of New York, but his negative rating in the WSJ/NBC survey is an astounding 65%. Ted Cruz is disliked by 49%, though he's less well known, with 21% having a neutral view. The Texan finished a distant third in New York to John Kasich.
Hard to believe, but Messrs. Trump and Cruz may be the only two Republicans who could lose to Hillary Clinton.",2016-04-21
"Election 2016: Clinton Courts African-American Voters --- Former senator offers plans for schools, jobs and a criminal-justice overhaul proposal",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765510534?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton, relying heavily on black voters in her battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, vowed Tuesday to address racial disparities in the nation's economy, criminal-justice system, health and schools.
In a speech delivered in New York City's Harlem neighborhood, a historic center of black culture, the former New York senator delivered a few barbs at rival Bernie Sanders, saying the U.S. isn't a ""single-issue country"" and that breaking up the big banks, as he proposes, isn't enough to address joblessness, problems some blacks have in obtaining mortgages or the epidemic of gun violence.
""These are not only problems of economic inequality, these are problems of racial inequality,"" she said. ""We have to say that loudly and clearly.""
Tuesday's address was the latest effort by Mrs. Clinton to explicitly court black voters. She has touted endorsements by high-profile black leaders and campaigned alongside Rep. John Lewis, a hero of the civil-rights movement. She has lamented troubling statistics about minorities via her Twitter feed and has repeatedly talked about, and traveled to, the majority black city of Flint, Mich., where a cost-savings move wound up poisoning the water supply with lead.
""Despite our best efforts and our highest hopes, America's long struggle with race is far from finished,"" she told the largely African-American audience at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
She offered a new proposal aimed at ending the ""school-to-prison pipeline"" by overhauling school discipline procedures and touted a string of other ideas. They include a criminal-justice overhaul, universal preschool, making it easier for ex-prisoners to re-enter society upon release and $125 billion to revitalize underserved communities, including money for youth jobs and to aid small businesses.
Earlier in the day, Mrs. Clinton met with the Rev. Al Sharpton and the heads of major civil-rights organizations. Mr. Sharpton, who met last week with Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton's Democratic challenger, wouldn't say whom he might endorse, saying the only one who knows is Mrs. Clinton. ""My lips are sealed!"" she said with a smile.
Given her failure to decisively win the Iowa caucuses and her loss to Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire, combined with the excitement her opponent is generating among many voters, Mrs. Clinton's ability to keep African-Americans in the fold may determine whether she is able to win the nomination.
Black voters make up a majority of the electorate in South Carolina, which votes Feb. 27, and in a string of Southern states that follow.
In her speech Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton suggested Mr. Sanders was a latecomer to the cause.
""You know, you can't just show up at election time and say the right things and think that's enough. We can't start building relationships a few weeks before a vote,"" she said.
She pointed to her own work as a young lawyer on behalf of poor children and asked African-American voters to hold her accountable ""not just when the cameras are on. . .but every single day.""
Her proposal for schools is aimed at dissuading them from suspending students and referring them to law enforcement, which can set them up for future problems. She proposed $2 billion to hire guidance counselors, social workers and others at schools with particularly high rates of suspensions and in-school arrests. The teams would be charged with working with at-risk students and training teachers to resolve conflicts internally.
Mr. Sanders is hardly conceding black voters. On Monday, he met with families from Flint and spoke at a large rally about his anger and sadness at the stories he heard. On Thursday, he plans to meet with civil-rights leaders in Washington.
On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign released a two-minute TV ad featuring Erica Garner, daughter of Eric Garner, a New York man who died after being choked by New York police officers. He also campaigned in South Carolina, attending a prayer breakfast at Allen University in Columbia, a historically black college.
Mr. Sanders recounted his participation in the March on Washington as a student and a recent visit to Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, site of the 1963 bombing that killed four young black girls. He said blacks were disproportionately affected by income inequality, an overzealous criminal-justice system, lack of health care and curbs on voting.

Election 2016: Bill Clinton Pitches Wife's Record To Voters Ahead of South Carolina,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765509528?accountid=12768,"GREENVILLE, S.C. -- A subdued Bill Clinton pitched his wife's record to black voters she needs to keep and millennials she would like to win back during a 40-minute speech Tuesday, marking one of his first appearances in the state since he was criticized for comments about then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.
Mr. Clinton said he understood that many young voters were attracted to Sen. Bernie Sanders, without mentioning him by name, for his promises of free college. He said there was a ""bumper sticker campaign"" that said big banks were the problem, acknowledging a frequent attack on Hillary Clinton that she is too cozy with Wall Street.
""A lot of these millennials are supporting the opponent, and I think they're making a mistake, because he's supporting free college,"" he said, adding that many people hadn't felt the economic recovery yet. ""You've got working people saying, what about me? You got millennials and college students saying, what about me?""
He argued that Mrs. Clinton had shown the ability to make progress on issues like health care and education, distinguishing her from Mr. Sanders because she could negotiate with Republicans and had served as secretary of state.
He hailed the removal of the Confederate flag after a mass shooting in Charleston last summer, praised Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state's only black member of Congress, lauded Mr. Obama and called for changes to the country's police force and prison system.
Mrs. Clinton has faced a strong challenge from Mr. Sanders, who is working to pull away black supporters in South Carolina while also making inroads at colleges.
Back in 2008, Mr. Clinton drew criticism for calling Mr. Obama's campaign a ""fairy tale"" and comparing his run to that of Jesse Jackson, who won South Carolina in 1984 and 1988 but fell short of the Democratic nomination. Mr. Obama won the state's 2008 primary by nearly 20 points.

Election 2016: Democrats Vie for Nevada's Minorities --- Clinton and Sanders seek to mobilize nonwhite voters as caucuses near,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765761463?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS -- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will face his biggest test so far in his run for the White House this week, when voters in one of the most ethnically and racially diverse states will make their choice in the Democratic presidential conteston Saturday.
Nevada -- a sprawling Western state with important blocs of Latino, black and Asian-American voters -- is the next stop for Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton. For Mr. Sanders, a win in the Silver State would be an opportunity to show he has appeal among the nonwhite voters who make up a significant part of the Democratic electorate. He has long trailed Mrs. Clinton in the polls among black and Hispanic voters. For Mrs. Clinton, a win here would be an important show of force and bolster her argument that she can put together a winning coalition against a Republican nominee.
""We're going to get a good sense of what Latinos, African-Americans, and Asians are thinking. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are working tirelessly to reach out to these communities,"" said Ruben Kihuen, a Nevada state senator running for U.S. Congress and a supporter of Mrs. Clinton.
The state is more than a quarter Latino and has a sizable black population. It also has a large Asian-American community, the fastest-growing minority group in the country. Non-Hispanic whites now represent less than half of the population of Las Vegas.
The state's diversity and the increasingly close battle between the two Democratic candidates have set off a fierce fight to persuade and mobilize nonwhite voters. Two Nevada polls this month show the contest in a dead heat, though the state is traditionally difficult to survey effectively.
Mrs. Clinton's campaign brought in Rep. John Lewis, a civil-rights icon and a longtime Democratic member of Congress from Georgia to help boost turnout among the black community. He made his case for Mrs. Clinton at several campaign stops this week, including at a historically black church and a community center in a low-income neighborhood. ""I'm going to continue to travel as long as there's a campaign,"" said Mr. Lewis, calling Mrs. Clinton the best-prepared candidate to be president.
The campaign also has brought in Dolores Huerta, a civil-rights leader and labor activist who co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with Cesar Chavez in the 1960s. The campaign is on television in Spanish and has hosted events in Spanish aimed at familiarizing Latino voters with the caucus process.
Mr. Sanders's campaign has been equally aggressive, particularly in the Latino community. The campaign brought Mr. Chavez's nephew, Federico Chavez as a surrogate. The campaign is dispatching a group of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children to knock on doors across the state. The campaign is on television with an endorsement from Lucy Flores, a former state legislator running for U.S. Congress.
Both candidates attended church services Sunday at a large historically black church in Las Vegas and addressed the congregation.
""I am not a single-issue candidate and this is not a single-issue country,"" Mrs. Clinton said, referring to Mr. Sanders's sharp focus on Wall Street and campaign-finance issues. ""Because if we were going to achieve everything about banks and money and politics, would that end racism?""
Sanders campaign state director Joan Kato said they are ceding no ground. ""We're doing outreach in all those communities,"" she said.
Mrs. Clinton's campaign strategy relies on maintaining her well of support with nonwhite voters after her narrow win in Iowa and big loss in New Hampshire. Both of those states are whiter and more rural than the country at large.
Still, her campaign began lowering expectations ahead of the caucuses here. ""There's an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucus in Nevada. But it's still a state that is 80% white voters,"" campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on MSNBC after New Hampshire.
The comment drew a rebuke from Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. Mr. Reid told reporters on Tuesday that he had complained to the Clinton campaign about the comment. Mrs. Clinton later rejected the comment in a television interview.
Steven Horsford, a Democrat who was the first black Congressman from Nevada and former majority leader of the state senate, said the explicit racial appeals may not work among younger nonwhite voters who are looking for a more comprehensive agenda. Mr. Horsford, now a Washington, D.C., marketing consultant, was voted out of office amid a Republican wave in Nevada in 2014.
""Both campaigns have more work to do to speak to a broad constituency and not put everybody in categories -- all African-American voters are not the same,"" said Mr. Horsford, who hasn't endorsed a candidate.

Brush Up Your Shakespeare; A global approval rating Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton can only envy.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783597454?accountid=12768,"Four hundred years after William Shakespeare departed this earth, and notwithstanding efforts by the politically correct to banish him from university curricula, this Dead White Englishman remains a global figure of astonishing vitality.
That's not surprising, given his contributions to an English language that is the dominant tongue in today's world. Millions who have never read ""Richard III"" or witnessed a performance of ""The Merchant of Venice"" would be shocked to learn that many phrases they use every day (""give the devil his due,"" ""brave new world,"" ""eaten me out of house and home,"" ""wild goose chase,"" ""bated breath,"" ""a foregone conclusion,"" etc.) originated with or were popularized by the Bard of Avon.
But more than English speakers have reason to be grateful. If a British Council survey of 18,000 people across 15 countries is to be believed, Shakespeare is more appreciated by those in the developing nations (Brazilians, Chinese, Mexicans, Indians and Turks) than by his fellow British. Across the globe he boasts a favorability rating--76% of those surveyed said they liked him--that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can only envy.
Shakespeare has also turned out to be a solid economic asset, directly as a draw for tourism, and indirectly for giving foreigners a positive introduction to Britain. As the British Council report puts it, his popularity continues to be ""an important asset for the UK's prosperity and soft power.""
Why the enduring, global popularity? The answer is simple. Though Shakespeare was a man who lived in England at a particular time, so well do his plays and poems capture the human condition that they speak to all people at all times. Which makes him as relevant in our world as he was in his own. We'd even go so far as to predict that Shakespeare will survive this era's progressive academic attempts to purge him for the sin of being the wrong race and gender.",2016-04-23
"Trump, Clinton Power Ahead --- Democrat's Big Night Widens Her Imposing Lead Over Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382400?accountid=12768,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton won critical presidential primaries in the industrial Midwest and completed her sweep of the South on Tuesday, as she took full command of a contest that has been far more competitive than expected at the start.
Rival Bernie Sanders was still hoping to win a close contest in Missouri, but that seemed nowhere near enough to change the dynamic of the race. Mrs. Clinton won in Ohio, Illinois, Florida and North Carolina, and blunted Mr. Sanders's momentum from a win last week in Michigan. She widened her already formidable delegate lead and made it improbable he can catch up.
""We are moving close to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November,"" the former secretary of state and New York senator told cheering supporters in Florida, boasting that she has won more votes than any candidate in either party.
She took a swipe at Mr. Sanders, saying he should be more specific about his plans, but she lodged a wholesale indictment of Republican front-runner Donald Trump. ""When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture -- that doesn't make him strong. It makes him wrong,"" she said.
With 214 pledged delegates at stake, Florida was the night's biggest prize, while Illinois had 156 pledged delegates and Ohio 143 up for grabs. They will be awarded proportionally.
Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders was ramping up his attacks on Mrs. Clinton, and has vowed to fight all the way to the summer convention. But he may now face increasing pressure to back off and revert to his earlier role as a candidate primarily driving a progressive, populist message rather than pursuing a viable path to the nomination.
At his election night rally in Arizona Tuesday night, though, Mr. Sanders showed no signs of backing off. He pointed to Wall Street contributions to the super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton and repeated his call that she release transcripts of her high-priced speeches to Wall Street firms.
""To my mind, if you're going to give a speech for $225,000 it must be a really great speech,"" he said. ""And if it's such a great speech, all of America should be able to read it.""
With nearly all precincts counted, Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Sanders by 64.5% to 33% in Florida, by 54.5% to 41% in North Carolina and by 56.5% to 42.7% in Ohio.
In Illinois, her margin was much closer, some 50.5% to 48.7% with 94% of precincts reporting.
Mrs. Clinton had been expected to easily win Florida, with the state's demographics and rules barring independents from participating helping her. But Ohio was closely fought, and Mr. Sanders had hoped to parlay a victory last week in Michigan to the neighboring state. Both have seen a drain in manufacturing jobs, and Mr. Sanders put the blame squarely on free-trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton has long supported.
Mrs. Clinton completed a sweep of the South, where strong support from African-Americans pumped up her totals. But her Ohio win was more important, showing she could win in the industrial Midwest.
After Tuesday's vote, Mrs. Clinton was assured of adding at least 253 delegates to her column, bringing her total pledged delegates, who are chosen by the voters, to more than 1,000. Mr. Sanders was sure to add at least 124 delegates, but he was on track to end the night more than 300 delegates behind. Including superdelegates, who can vote for any candidate they like, her total topped 1,400, more than double his.
At roughly the halfway point of the race, Sanders advisers say they now have the advantage. His campaign now looks ahead to contests next week in Arizona, Utah and Idaho, three states where aides have hoped to do well. But the next big delegate hauls aren't awarded until April: first in Wisconsin, and then the giant prize of New York, where Mrs. Clinton lives and which she represented in the Senate for eight years.
In Florida, Mrs. Clinton's advantage was on display Tuesday in Miami, home to large populations of Hispanic and African-American voters who have gravitated to her campaign.
""I like that she's a smart, charismatic woman,"" said Bridgette Thornton, a 37-year-old African-American attorney, who cast her ballot at a Miami church. ""It was a difficult choice for me, but I'm a practical person. Hillary has a better shot at winning the presidential election.""
The race was closer in Ohio, where Mr. Sanders hammered his anti-free-trade views in recent days. Mrs. Clinton tried to recast her trade message, but the attempt fell flat with at least some voters.
""The Clinton history with trade policies, that really just killed our area,"" said Fred Woke, a 57-year-old radio announcer who voted for Mr. Sanders in Niles.
The challenge for both Democrats is that Mr. Trump, should he win the Republican nomination, would be an unconventional opponent who could pick up some of Mr. Sanders's populist arguments.
That has some Clinton backers anxious for Mr. Sanders to ease up. ""The message of Sanders campaign has become personal attacks,"" said Robert Zimmerman, a superdelegate from New York who backs Mrs. Clinton. ""It's not only wrong, it's dangerous politically if he keeps up that tone.""
Steve Elmendorf, a consultant who backs Mrs. Clinton, agreed there will come a point when Mr. Sanders needs to let up, but he said it isn't for Clinton supporters to say when. ""When it becomes clear you cannot win, then you should unite behind the nominee of the party and try to beat the Republicans,"" Mr. Elmendorf said. ""It's for him to decide when he can't win.""
In 2008, Mrs. Clinton continued to compete in presidential-primary contests against then-Sen. Barack Obama even though he remained ahead in the delegate race the entire time.
""Even if he doesn't think he will win the nomination, he's trying to amass as many delegates as he can,"" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. Delegates would give Mr. Sanders leverage at the party's convention and demonstrate the strength of his movement, Mr. Trippi said, adding, ""I don't see him relenting.""
Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant in Florida who voted for Mrs. Clinton, said he doesn't worry that the Sanders attacks will damage her, partly because Democrats are sure to unify if Mr. Trump is the nominee. ""You want to get Democrats over the Sanders-Clinton thing, give them five seconds to think about Trump being within five feet of the nuclear codes,"" Mr. Schale said.

"Trump, Clinton Power Ahead --- GOP Front-Runner Knocks Out Rubio, but Kasich Hangs Onto Ohio",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382358?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump scored victories in the Republican presidential primaries Tuesday, winning Florida, the biggest delegate prize of the night, and driving home-state Sen. Marco Rubio out of the race.
Mr. Trump also won in North Carolina and Illinois. But Ohio Gov. John Kasich prevailed in his home state. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was battling Mr. Trump in a tight race in Missouri, slowing the front-runner's pace toward the GOP nomination.
In his victory speech to supporters in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump vowed that his candidacy would broaden the reach of the Republican Party.
""We have a great opportunity,"" he said. ""Democrats are coming in. Independents are coming in, and, more important, people who have never voted before.""
Still, by defeating Mr. Rubio on his home turf, Mr. Trump dashed the hopes of Republican leaders who saw the young, Cuban-American senator as their best messenger to broaden the party's appeal.
Mr. Kasich, a two-term governor and former congressman, is left as the only representative of a GOP leadership wary of the combative Mr. Cruz and openly hostile toward Mr. Trump.
Tuesday's muddled results will make it harder for Mr. Trump to earn the 1,237 delegates he needs to claim the nomination before the Republican convention in July.
""What we all thought would never happen -- a convention fight -- now has a better-than-even chance of occurring,"" said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised a super PAC backing former candidate Jeb Bush. ""We haven't seen a presidential election like this before, and we're unlikely to see one like it again.""
Mr. Kasich's win in Ohio was his first of the GOP race, and it offers him a tenuous lifeline.
""The campaign goes on,"" he told supporters in Cleveland, the site of the GOP convention in July. ""We're going to go all the way . . . and secure the Republican nomination.""
Mr. Rubio emerged shortly after polls closed to announce that he was ending his campaign. He said his campaign was ill-timed for a year dominated by anger and resentment. ""While we are on the right side, this year we will not be on the winning side,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""While this may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimistic message about our future, I remain hopeful and optimistic about America.""
It was a day of reckoning for the GOP leadership, which had targeted the winner-take-all contests in Ohio and Florida as the best chance to slow the New York businessman's momentum. Anti-Trump groups have plowed more than $35 million into attack ads, with the biggest share, $16 million, airing in Florida, according to Federal Election Commission reports.
Mr. Trump scored an early win on Tuesday in the Republican caucuses on the Northern Mariana Islands and was expected to earn all nine of the territory's delegates. More than half of the total delegates to the Republican convention will have been awarded once votes in Ohio, Florida, Missouri, Illinois and North Carolina are tallied on Tuesday.
Before Tuesday's votes, Mr. Trump had earned 460 delegates, compared with Mr. Cruz's 370. Mr. Rubio was in third place with 163 and Mr. Kasich had 63.
Florida will award Mr. Trump all of its 99 delegates, while Ohio will give Mr. Kasich its 66 delegates.
Mr. Cruz aimed to upset Mr. Trump in Missouri, which has 52 delegates, and was positioned to pick up a share of the 72 delegates in North Carolina and 69 delegates in Illinois. He also campaigned in Ohio and Florida in recent days with the hope of siphoning votes from Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio, and landing a coveted one-on-one match-up against the New York businessman in the remaining primaries. Yet Tuesday's results likely mean the best Mr. Trump's rivals can hope for is a contested convention.
In a speech to supporters in his hometown of Houston, Mr. Cruz said Rubio supporters should join his campaign now that their candidate had dropped out. ""Starting tomorrow morning there is a clear choice,"" he said. ""We welcome you with open and welcoming arms.""
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump, with a Tuesday call to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), is sending signals he is ready to step into the role of presumptive nominee.
""We had a good conversation,"" Mr. McConnell said. The senator said he raised the issue of physical violence at Mr. Trump's rallies and said he told Mr. Trump: ""It might be a good idea to condemn that . . . no matter what the source.""
Mr. Trump's continued rise comes despite harsh condemnations from the last two GOP nominees, former Gov. Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain. The GOP establishment has appeared powerless in the face of the pro-Trump populist uprising. And a convention nomination fight could provoke a backlash from his supporters and deepen divisions within the Republican Party.
""That could be very self-destructive for Republicans,"" said Bill Nojay, a New York lawmaker and leading Trump supporter in his own state. ""Do we want to waste time fighting among ourselves, or unify behind Mr. Trump and focus on what's important, which is beating Hillary Clinton?""""
In a sign that some Republicans are resigned to Mr. Trump being the nominee, a new super PAC was launched Tuesday to try to protect GOP majorities in Congress at a time when Mr. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric is tainting the party's image, according to the group's founders.
As voters went to the polls Tuesday, the Conservative Bridge super PAC began sending fundraising emails to millions of Republicans around the country. Unlike other groups formed in response to Mr. Trump's rise, Conservative Bridge is not trying to intervene in the presidential race. Instead, the group is acting preemptively to try to boost vulnerable Republicans in down-ballot races with an untested candidate like Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket.
""We are operating on the assumption that Donald Trump will be the presidential nominee,"" said Arizona-based political consultant Bert Coleman, who is among four Republicans at the new group's helm.
""We think the presidential campaign as a whole, in particular Trump's harsh rhetoric, has damaged the Republican brand, and the name of the game is now turning out Republican voters in November.""
Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Kasich said that he plans to offer more detailed critiques of Mr. Trump's policies and conduct in the campaign.
Mr. Kasich told reporters after voting Tuesday morning in his hometown of Westerville that he would be ""forced going forward to talk about the way this campaign has been run by some others, by one other in particular.""
""But today is not the day to do that,"" added Mr. Kasich, who has avoided negative attacks.
Mr. Kasich is scheduled to campaign on Wednesday in Pennsylvania, though a Rubio supporter is challenging his spot on the April 26 ballot in court. He is also planning to stump in Utah on Friday ahead of its March 22 caucuses.
The face-off between Mr. Kasich and Mr. Trump in Ohio was a particularly pointed test of whether the 2016 GOP electorate could be persuaded to support an experienced, accomplished politician in spite of widespread disgust with party-establishment leaders.
Mr. Kasich's victory came in spite of the fact that many constituents were attracted to Mr. Trump's anti-establishment siren call.
""I'm sick of the establishment, both Democrats and Republicans, they're screwing the U.S. citizens, shipping our work overseas,"" said Trump voter Rex Bailey, 64 years old, a Mansfield, Ohio, resident who said he was laid off from his job as a telephone company engineer in January.
""Kasich is OK, but he's still part of the establishment.""

"Election 2016: Early Voting Likely to Boost Trump, Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768849747?accountid=12768,"Early voting in the Super Tuesday states is likely to give yet another boost to the candidacies of front runners Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to campaign veterans and political scientists.
That's because of the characteristics of early voters. The most passionately committed supporters tend to cast their ballots early. African-Americans vote early in disproportionate numbers. And many early voters are wasted because candidates drop out after the voters have cast their ballots. So all the voters who cast absentee ballots for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- a fierce critic of Mr. Trump -- aren't available for other candidates to scoop up.
Apply all these factors to the current race, experts say, and the edge goes to the front-runners.
In the case of Mr. Trump, his supporters tend to be those who make up their mind early. According to entrance polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina, 58% of Mr. Trump's voters said they decided to cast their votes for him over a month before Election Day. In Nevada, 55% of Trump voters decided at least a week before the election.
Early voting gives such voters a way to express their fealty, says University of Florida political scientist Daniel Smith, an early-voting specialist.
""Donald Trump may be banking early votes through absentee ballots and early voting,"" he said. ""That's good for Donald Trump, especially if the anti-Trump forces start to coalesce and bring him down.""
In Mrs. Clinton's case, her strength with black voters gives her an early-voting edge. On Friday, she spoke at a rally at Atlanta City Hall. After the event, her volunteers phoned voters to get them to cast their ballots that day, the last day of the early-voting period.
Among the many unknowns, though, is whether the early votes that a candidate banks before Tuesday will add to the contender's totals or simply shift the day on which the candidate receives the votes he or she was already going to get.
Among the Super Tuesday states, Virginia, Alabama and Massachusetts sharply restrict early voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. There, supporters can't cast votes early at a polling station and must provide specific reasons why they need to use absentee ballots. In the rest, residents can either show up and vote, starting a week or two weeks before election days or use absentee ballots without restrictions. In some of the states, voters can do either.
The numbers who choose to vote early are large, especially on the Republican side.
In Tennessee, nearly 400,000 ballots were cast in the early-voting period, including about 260,000 Republicans -- or roughly half the number of Republicans who voted in the 2008 and 2012 GOP primaries. In Georgia, about 417,000 people have already voted, topping the 2008 record of 271,000. Of those, about 260,000 were Republicans.
In Texas, 1.1 million votes were cast in early voting, including about 660,000 Republicans. That is 44% of the 1.5 million GOP votes cast in 2012.
Supporters of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz say his large voter-turnout organization can help blunt any advantage
Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said she is ""confident in our GOTV [get out the vote] efforts in Texas and beyond.""
In Florida, which votes March 15, early in-person voting started Monday in some counties. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, like Mr. Cruz in Texas, is hoping his home-state advantage and political organization will help blunt Mr. Trump's momentum. But some, perhaps many, absentee ballots were cast for Mr. Bush, making such voters unavailable to Mr. Rubio.
Rich Beeson, Mr. Rubio's deputy campaign manager, said he didn't think that would be a big problem. ""People are holding on to their ballots longer than before,"" he said.

Election 2016: Final Batch Of Clinton Emails Released,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768849744?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- The State Department completed its release of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email archive on Monday, making public the final batch of her online correspondence.
All told, 2,115 of Mrs. Clinton's total archive of roughly 30,000 email messages have been deemed classified. Of those, 2,093 emails are now considered ""confidential"" or ""secret,"" the two lowest levels of classification, and have been released in redacted form. Of the emails released Monday, 238 were deemed to be ""confidential"" and another 23 are now classified as ""secret.""
Another 22 emails previously were classified at the higher ""top secret"" designation and withheld entirely from public release.
None of the emails in Mrs. Clinton's archive had classification markings when they were sent or received by her and her staff.
The release of Mrs. Clinton's emails, distributed in batches over several months,concludes one chapter in the continuing legal saga about records management during her tenure at the State Department between 2009 and 2013 -- an issue that has spawned dozens of lawsuits, an FBI investigation, an internal State Department probe, an intelligence community review and congressional oversight from a number of committees.
Given the policy questions, legal issues and political debates surrounding the emails, the final release is unlikely to quell the controversy over Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while serving in government, an arrangement that was discouraged but not forbidden by State Department rules.
Mrs. Clinton is now a Democratic presidential candidate in a competitive race against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Her campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
The documents released by the State Department on Monday span the full four years of her tenure atop of the State Department, most about the mundane day-to-day business of running the department. A handful show the occasional tug of wars and rivalries that occasionally erupted between the rival national security power centers at the State Department and the White House.
Critics say Mrs. Clinton's use of a private server made public access to her records more difficult and may have put sensitive or classified national security information at risk.
Mrs. Clinton has said she supports the public release of her email archive. She has also said that nothing in her email archive was marked classified at the time it was sent, and her supporters have argued that national security was never jeopardized.

"Trump, Clinton Seize Leads --- Weekend wins give both the upper hand in amassing delegates in next state contests",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767034250?accountid=12768,"PAHRUMP, Nev. -- Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton emerged from a weekend of voting as the clear leaders in the fight for their parties' presidential nominations, with smoother potential paths to victory than seemed likely a few weeks ago.
After winning the South Carolina primary, Mr. Trump should continue to benefit from a splintered Republican field that allows him to rack up convention delegates elsewhere in the South. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton's win in Nevada's caucuses has helped dispel doubts about her candidacy just as it heads on to favorable turf in the South, where she always figured to be stronger than her competitor Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Both front-runners still face obstacles. Mr. Trump may soon be hit with more direct attacks, and, as the field winnows, a pair of winner-take-all primaries in March could allow a competitor to make up ground quickly. And Mrs. Clinton faces a rival who has a fervent base of support in some states that lie ahead, while she has lower levels of support than her campaign would like in some pockets of the Democratic electorate.
In the short term, though, both will benefit from a primary map that is likely to give them some running room in the delegate hunt.
Mr. Trump is expected to win Nevada's Tuesday caucuses, and the state's 30 delegates, and then 12 states vote on Super Tuesday, March 1. Seven of those states are Southern contests that are key to Sen. Ted Cruz's path to victory. But Mr. Trump's convincing victory in South Carolina has put the Texan's proposition that he will be the choice of the region's social conservatives on shaky ground.
A total of 989 Republican delegates are at stake between March 1 and March 12, to be awarded proportionally, giving Mr. Trump a chance to build a significant advantage before the start of the winner-take-all primaries March 15. A total of 1,237 delegates are needed to secure the GOP nomination.
""If Trump can't be stopped from taking a majority of Super Tuesday delegates it's hard to see how he's not going to be the nominee,"" said Walker Stapleton, the Colorado state treasurer who was co-chairman of Jeb Bush's campaign in Colorado. The former Florida governor dropped out of the race Saturday after a poor showing in South Carolina.
A string of losses in the Southern states could be debilitating to Mr. Cruz, the Iowa caucus winner who is jockeying with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to become the primary alternative to Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubio took second place in South Carolina but is under growing pressure to show he can win a state. His home turf, Florida, holds a winner-take-all contest on March 15.
Speaking to reporters here Sunday, Mr. Cruz predicted he would defeat Mr. Trump in a one-on-one matchup should the party choose him as the alternative to the businessman.
""Donald Trump has demonstrated that he has a relatively high floor of support, but he's also got, I think, a ceiling,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""You've got nearly 70% of Republican primary voters that don't believe Donald is the right person to represent our party in the general election against Hillary Clinton.""
Lying in wait outside of the South is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished in fifth place in South Carolina with less than 8% support after his surprise second-place showing in New Hampshire. His campaign is working Massachusetts, another March 1 state, and will need a strong showing in the March 8 Michigan primary to justify his candidacy.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson took sixth in South Carolina but is remaining in the race.
The longer the non-Trump vote is divided four ways, or even split between two candidates, the more delegates Mr. Trump will collect by winning with a plurality of the primary votes rather than a majority.
Beyond the map, the rhetoric on the campaign trail has leaned Mr. Trump's way, with most rivals avoiding attacking him so as not to draw his fire.
It is a stark difference from 2012, when after Newt Gingrich won South Carolina's primary, the rival Mitt Romney campaign launched a full-scale effort to take down the former House speaker in Florida, the next voting state. Romney surrogates, such as Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, trailed Mr. Gingrich at his events and attacked his record to reporters while the campaign and supportive super PAC peppered the airwaves with TV ads hitting Mr. Gingrich.
No campaign has even attempted anything similar to attack Mr. Trump. Mr. Gingrich said Sunday it probably wouldn't work anyway.
""You can't have the Romney effect this year,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Nobody can raise enough money, and furthermore, we don't know of any message that works"" against Mr. Trump.
Of the roughly $215 million that super PACs have spent so far on advertisements, phone calls and mailers promoting or attacking candidates of both parties, just about $9 million -- or 4% -- has been spent opposing Mr. Trump, who has been leading national polls since July.
The biggest hit was from Our Principles PAC, a group created by a former aide to Mr. Romney's 2012 campaign. The group has spent about $3.8 million attacking Mr. Trump, though $3 million of its fundraising has come from two donors: Marlene Ricketts, the wife of TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, and Wisconsin shipping executive Richard Uihlein, according to campaign-finance reports.
Mr. Chaffetz, who backs Mr. Rubio, arrived in Nevada on Sunday. But he has no plans to attend Mr. Trump's Las Vegas rally Monday. Instead, the House Oversight Committee chairman drove to Pahrump, a retirement community near the California border, to ""provide oversight"" for Mr. Cruz outside a sports bar where the Texan appeared for a rally.
Asked why he isn't trying to distract the front-runner, Mr. Chaffetz replied, ""I don't even know if that's possible with Mr. Trump . . . .If you're a Trump fan, you're a Trump fan.""
Clinton campaign officials, for their part, believe the Nevada victory bodes well for the racially diverse set of states that come up next.
""Nevada posed the first test for both campaigns in a diverse state -- the first test of whether Sen. Sanders could broaden his appeal. . . .And he came up short,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said.
Mr. Sanders said on CNN Sunday that his campaign is gaining support among Hispanic voters. ""I think our message is resonating,"" he said.
Delegates are awarded proportionally in the Democratic nomination fight, making it hard for one candidate to clinch the nomination early. But Clinton campaign aides are convinced the former senator and secretary of state is on a path to roll up an insurmountable lead by the end of March.
Mrs. Clinton also already has a big lead among superdelegates, a group of Democratic Party officials who will make up about 30% of the total needed to win.
One of Mr. Sanders's strengths had appeared to be states that hold caucuses, which typically inspire candidacies that fire up party activists, rather than primaries. Yet Mrs. Clinton has won the two caucus states.
""When they articulate their path, when they talk about how they're going to compete for the nomination, they talk about caucus states. We're now 2-0 in caucus states,"" Mr. Fallon said.

"Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Clinton Advances, Trump Redefines Normal for the GOP",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766945197?accountid=12768,"Regular order has begun returning for Democrats. Republicans still aren't sure whether their version of regular order even exists any longer.
The one thing that was settled as voters spoke Saturday in two states -- Democrats in Nevada and Republicans in South Carolina -- is that there now is no doubt about the identity of the front-runners in the 2016 presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton has re-established herself, as she was always supposed to, as the Democratic favorite. And whether party leaders like it or not, Donald Trump now is indisputably the favorite to win the GOP nomination.
Mr. Trump continues to remake both the Republican Party and what a winning coalition within it looks like. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, he enjoyed significant strength among blue-collar, non-college-educated voters in South Carolina. They used to be a GOP afterthought, but increasingly seem to be its core.
Meanwhile, there is little consolidation in the anti-Trump lanes, and still too many of them to suit party establishment figures eager to stop Mr. Trump. This is at least a three-man race going forward, with Mr. Trump joined by Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. Technically, for now, it is actually a five-man race, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson hanging around.
Only former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush took South Carolina's results as a signal to quit the race. Mr. Kasich should gird himself, though, for he is about to come under enormous pressure to do the same, to allow the anti-Trump vote to consolidate.
By the end of Saturday night, the reality was simply this: It isn't clear who is the real alternative to Mr. Trump. South Carolina, with its large population of evangelical Christians, was supposed to be the ideal spot for Mr. Cruz, yet he failed to win. Mr. Rubio made a nice comeback from an embarrassing finish in New Hampshire, but he still hasn't shown that he can actually win anywhere.
Big money and big establishment support will be flowing to Mr. Rubio in coming days; the establishment will effectively anoint him the alternative to Mr. Trump. In his post-South Carolina speech, he wrapped himself in the cloak of Ronald Reagan, and hit a generational-change note by declaring that he will lead the ""children of Reagan"" into a new era of conservative power. But it is far from clear that will be enough.
For the Democrats, the situation is more simple. Mrs. Clinton didn't win Nevada's caucuses impressively, but she didn't have to. She just had to avoid raising new -- and damaging -- questions about her viability before Democrats vote in South Carolina next week.
Mrs. Clinton should win big there, because of a big African-American vote that is the foundation of her candidacy. Her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, nearly conceded that state in his own concession speech.
The problem for Mr. Sanders isn't so much South Carolina next Saturday as it is the road that follows. On March 1, Democrats move on to a series of Southern states that simply don't figure to be friendly territory for him. Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia all vote that day, and in each of them the African-American share of the population tops 15%. Texas also rolls in on March 1. A third of that state's population is Hispanic, and that also figures to be a friendly Clinton audience.
Less obviously, Nevada suggested one other Clinton asset. Until now, being the establishment choice hasn't been a good thing for much of this election cycle. But it proved to be in Nevada; older, more moderate, mainstream Democratic voters were the ones who showed up in force there for her.
Still, Mrs. Clinton continues to face the same problem she has had weighing her down since day one, which is voters' lack of confidence in her honesty and integrity. As Democratic pollster Peter Hart put it to the Journal this past week: ""She is running against herself.""
Mr. Sanders has an army of energized supporters and a still-healthy bank account, and states he can win on March 1: Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota and perhaps even Oklahoma. So things are far from decided. But for the Democrats, unlike for Republicans, a return to something resembling normalcy at least seems possible.

Election 2016: Sanders Slices Into Clinton's Lead,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766256774?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders has cut Hillary Clinton's once-commanding national lead in the Democratic presidential race by more than half over the past month, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds.
Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, drew support from 53% of people who expect to vote in Democratic primaries, while 42% picked Mr. Sanders. That 11-point spread is much closer than the 25-point advantage Mrs. Clinton enjoyed a month ago, when the poll found her ahead by 59% to 34%.
The new poll found that Mrs. Clinton holds a solid but diminished lead among her core group of supporters: women. She continues to dominate among minorities, a crucial voting bloc in coming contests in Nevada and the South.
""The race is tightening,"" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who helped conduct the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. At the same time, he said, Mrs. Clinton retains ""structural advantages . . . that put her in a competitive position to be the Democratic nominee.""
The poll points to a long-term challenge for Mrs. Clinton in the continued rise of negative feelings about her among the broader electorate. Half of the people surveyed said they felt negatively about her, a record high for her. More than half said they would feel uncertain or pessimistic if she won the White House.
Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster who helped conduct the survey, said Mrs. Clinton's biggest obstacle isn't Mr. Sanders, but her own difficulty in winning the trust and affection of voters.
""She is running against herself,"" Mr. Hart said. ""When it comes to competence, temperament . . . she laps the field. Voters just need to like her.""
The poll, conducted Feb. 14-16, signaled continuing progress for Mr. Sanders in the aftermath of Iowa's caucuses, where Mrs. Clinton barely eked out a victory, and in New Hampshire, where the Vermont senator won decisively.
Mr. Sanders's gains over the past month were due in large part to rising support among younger women. Mrs. Clinton remains ahead among women overall, but Mr. Sanders slashed her lead by 19 percentage points, to 58%-39%. Mr. Sanders leads among women under age 50, while Mrs. Clinton holds a far larger lead among those 50 and older.
A bigger challenge for Mr. Sanders has been his underperformance among minority voters. He made some gains among nonwhite voters in the new poll, but Mrs. Clinton still leads among those voters by 29 percentage points, 62% to 33%. In January, she had led by 42 points.
More Democratic voters express reservations about Mr. Sanders's key weaknesses than about Mrs. Clinton's. About one-quarter said they were concerned about his lack of foreign policy experience, and 23% said his policy proposals were out of the mainstream.
Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street -- a central line of attack by Mr. Sanders -- were a concern to 22% of Democratic voters. Questions about Mrs. Clinton's honesty and judgment related to her use of a private email server while in the government seemed of little consequence within the party:Only 7% of Democratic primary voters said they were concerned about it.
Mr. Sanders is winning over change-oriented young women such as Laurren Nirider, 25, a poll participant in Richland, Wash.
""I'm 100% behind having a woman president. But I'm not going to support someone just because she's a woman,"" said Ms. Nirider, who backs Mr. Sanders. ""Compared to Hillary Clinton, he's going to be able to move the country in a more forward direction. He's rattling the cages a little more.""
Nancy D. Pemberton, 65, a college teacher in Tryon, N.C., said she thought Mr. Sanders was too inexperienced and his policies unrealistic. She saw Mrs. Clinton as better equipped for the office. ""She can get the job done, and that is the most compelling thing that I am looking at,"" said Ms. Pemberton, who added, ""It couldn't hurt to have a woman in there.""
The poll asked voters of both parties to consider hypothetical matchups and found that Mr. Sanders, at least for now, seemed better equipped than Mrs. Clinton to beat a GOP opponent in the fall.
Mr. Sanders outpolled businessman Donald Trump by 16 points -- 53% to 37% -- and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas by 50% to 40%.
Mrs. Clinton also beat Mr. Trump in a one-on-one matchup, 50% to 40%, but only tied Mr. Cruz, 46% to 46%.
Mr. Hart warned, however, that such polls this early in a campaign are poor predictors of general election matchups when a candidate is as little known as Mr. Sanders.
If the election came to a Clinton-Trump face-off, Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Trump, 50% to 40%, among registered voters. But only 34% said their vote would be a sign of support for their chosen candidate, while 47% said it would signal they didn't want the other candidate to be elected.
Asked whether they viewed the candidates in a favorable or unfavorable light, voters had sharply negative views of three candidates: Mrs. Clinton and Messrs. Cruz and Trump. Some 59% of voters viewed Mr. Trump negatively.
Views of only two candidates -- Mr. Sanders and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- were more positive than negative.
None of the candidates in either party inspired great confidence: Asked how they would feel if each were elected president, no candidate prompted more than 21% of voters to say they would feel ""optimistic and confident.""

Election 2016: Bill Clinton Charges Where Campaign Hesitates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766256640?accountid=12768,"Before his wife entered the presidential campaign, Bill Clinton said he might no longer be up to the rigors of campaigning. As a new grandfather, he said, he just wasn't ""mad"" enough anymore.
Now Mr. Clinton is in the thick of the race, trying to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton recapture lost ground -- and he occasionally does sound a bit angry about how the contest is unfolding.
""When you're making a revolution, you can't be too careful with the facts,"" he said in New Hampshire, in a reference to the calls from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for a ""political revolution.""
His speeches combine a defense of his economic record, praise for his wife and a critique of the Sanders candidacy that varies in intensity. The 69-year-old Mr. Clinton often sounds wistful, noting that his life is winding down. A favorite phrase is he has more ""yesterdays than tomorrows."" He says that realization helps one to focus more on ""tomorrows.""
Clinton campaign aides say he remains a master of ""explaining stuff,"" the title President Barack Obama gave him in the 2012 race. Voters who come to see Mr. Clinton usually walk away impressed.
Yet his speeches have sometimes proved a distraction for his wife's campaign, and some analysts say talk of his age isn't helpful in a race focused on the future.
""Adding him to the mix raises the age differential rather than creating an image of youth and vigor,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University.
Never the most disciplined of surrogates, he wanders into territory Mrs. Clinton avoids in her stump speeches. At an event in New Hampshire, the former president started with an extended discussion of Republican investigations into the attack on the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi.
Mr. Clinton then segued to the controversy surrounding the private email server his wife used while in office. At her own events, Mrs. Clinton generally focuses on her policy proposals -- not on these politically charged disputes.
Friends of Mr. Clinton said he seems tired on the trail. Since leaving office, he has had multiple surgical procedures to address heart disease.
Mr. Clinton checks in routinely with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook and campaign chairman John Podesta, who was his final chief of staff at the White House, to offer advice, aides say.
""President Clinton is enormously popular and remains one of the most gifted communicators in public life,"" said Mr. Podesta. ""Any day we are able to have President Clinton out talking directly to voters about Hillary's history of being a change-maker is a tremendous day for our campaign.""
Grandfatherhood hasn't entirely mellowed the 42nd president. He has been quick to complain to friends and allies that his wife should be in a stronger position, people familiar with his views said.
He wants the campaign to talk more about Mrs. Clinton's interest in bringing about change -- a message obscured by her focus on her experience and the policies she supports.
""I'm sure he's frustrated,"" said Ed Rendell, former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania and a longtime ally of the Clintons. ""Most of this is a ratification of how well Sen. Sanders has hit a nerve with a lot of the American people, more than the failings of Hillary.""

Election 2016: Clinton Warns About GOP Rival,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774717228?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton warned the leading pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. that Donald Trump's foreign-policy proposals could undercut American leadership on the world stage and jeopardize the Jewish state's security, offering a preview of Democratic attacks on the Republican front-runner.
Mrs. Clinton didn't mention Mr. Trump by name Monday during remarks to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, but she condemned his views on a range of issues, casting the businessman as inconsistent and dangerously unqualified to be president.
""We need steady hands -- not a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because everything's negotiable,"" Mrs. Clinton told the group. ""Well, my friends, Israel's security is nonnegotiable.""
The former secretary of state has ratcheted up her criticism of Mr. Trump in recent weeks. But her address to Aipac, delivered hours before her GOP rival spoke to the same audience, was a broader, more aggressive critique of Mr. Trump's worldview and credentials, opening up a new front ahead of a potential general-election battle.
Mrs. Clinton emphasized her own experience and her ""unwavering, unshakable commitment to our alliance and to Israel's future as a secure and democratic homeland for the Jewish people.""
Mr. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric about women, immigrants and Muslims spurred protests ahead of his Aipac speech, and his pledge to be neutral in efforts to negotiate a peace deal in the Middle East has drawn criticism. U.S. presidential candidates generally have struck a more pro-Israel posture, emphasizing the two countries' close alliance.
Mrs. Clinton told the group that ""America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security or survival.""
""Some things aren't negotiable,"" she said. ""And anyone who doesn't understand that has no business being our president.""
Mr. Trump pushed back against some of Mrs. Clinton's charges in a CNN interview Monday, saying, ""She doesn't know me. She doesn't know my policy. There is no one who is more pro-Israel than I am.""
The GOP front-runner said he would love to remain neutral in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations but noted, ""It's probably not possible. There is just so much hatred.""
And he disputed Mrs. Clinton's assertion that he would be an unpredictable commander in chief.
""I have the steadiest hands,"" he said. ""Look at those hands -- far steadier than hers.""
Mr. Trump addressed Aipac Monday evening, as did the other two challengers for the Republican presidential nomination, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
At Aipac, Mr. Trump called the former secretary of state ""a total disaster"" but focused primarily on detailing his views about the Middle East. He said his administration would ""send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel.""
Mrs. Clinton's primary opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the only Jewish candidate, declined an invitation to attend the event. Mr. Sanders delivered a foreign-policy address Monday in Salt Lake City, and he told Aipac officials in a letter that the issues affecting ""Israel and the Middle East are of the utmost importance to me, to our country and to the world.""
In her address, Mrs. Clinton told the group the GOP contenders would offer a very different view on American leadership in the world.
""You'll get a glimpse of a potential U.S. foreign policy that would insult our allies, not engage them, and embolden our adversaries, not defeat them,"" she said. ""For the security of Israel and the world, we need America to remain a respected global leader . . . the alternative is unthinkable.""
Mrs. Clinton also decried Trump rhetoric on the campaign trail, suggesting that he has encouraged violence, played coy with white supremacists and called for turning away refugees based on their religion.
""We've had dark chapters in our history before,"" she said. ""But America should be better than this, and I believe it's our responsibility as citizens to say so.""
Mrs. Clinton also offered assurances that she would take the U.S.-Israel alliance ""to the next level,"" pledging to strengthen Israel's military, repudiate anti-Semitism, and hold Tehran accountable for any violation of the Iran nuclear agreement.

Clinton Coalition Takes Aim At Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774134751?accountid=12768,"Pro-Democratic groups are launching an orchestrated bid to weaken GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump ahead of a potential November showdown with Hillary Clinton, while her campaign readies a strategy of engaging the billionaire businessman on issues without trading insults.
A coalition of 22 liberal groups -- including some that have endorsed Mrs. Clinton and others that back her Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders -- have united behind a campaign to stop Mr. Trump.
Among their plans: anti-Trump demonstrations, possibly including protests at the Republican National Convention this summer in Cleveland, and marches in major cities.
""So far, Trump has bounced around the country speaking to people in these stadium rallies, and we haven't seen massive marches outside the rallies,"" said Ben Wikler, Washington director for Moveon.org, which is leading the coalition.
A spokesman for Mr. Trump predicted that such efforts would backfire.
""What you find with Donald Trump is he's a counter-puncher,"" Corey Lewandowski, the Trump campaign manager, said in an interview on Thursday. ""Someone punches him and he punches back, and he punches back much harder. That's what the Republican field has come to realize.""
Although Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton haven't clinched their parties' nominations, the two are on a path to face off in November, based on large leads in delegates. The former secretary of state has the clearest route, while Mr. Trump still faces obstacles in amassing enough delegates to clinch the nomination. Should he fall short, he also must confront the prospect of a contested Republican convention in July.
A newcomer to politics, Mr. Trump has shown himself to be a skillful campaigner whose attacks on GOP opponents have helped fuel his rise.
A Clinton aide said her campaign has carefully monitored how Republican rivals have sought to blunt Mr. Trump's momentum, veering from ignoring him to trading personal insults with him, never with much impact.
The Democratic front-runner's aides are planning to keep her out of a war of insults, concluding that independent voters will recoil at Mr. Trump's heated rhetoric and reward her discretion. Their plan is to try to challenge Mr. Trump on substance, the Clinton aide said.
""I think that she has to be above it all,"" said Alan Patricof, a Clinton fundraiser. ""To me, running against a bully, an egotist, a screamer, is a very difficult challenge, because you can't deal with a person like this in a normal fashion.""
Mr. Trump's supporters often cite his demeanor as a refreshing change from scripted politics.
Apart from the Clinton campaign itself, liberal activists, labor unions and pro-Clinton super PACS are girding to spend tens of millions of dollars to try to weaken Mr. Trump. After months spent digging into his business dealings and monitoring his speeches, these groups are stepping up plans to try to discredit him in the eyes of voters.
One pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA Action, released a video on Wednesday that sought to cast doubt on Mr. Trump's foreign-policy acumen. The AFL-CIO this week put out ads on Facebook and Twitter that aim to weaken Mr. Trump's appeal to working-class voters, depicting him as a foe of organized labor.
Major women's groups, including NARAL Pro-Choice America and Emily's List, are also plotting anti-Trump campaigns, in addition to pro-Clinton organizing that was in the works no matter who the Republicans nominate.
A senior Democrat who has spoken with Clinton campaign officials and others in the party in recent days said the multi-pronged strategy under review includes enlisting the Muslim, Hispanic and gay communities in an effort to paint Mr. Trump as a divisive force in American politics.
A pair of super PACs loyal to Mrs. Clinton have already accumulated a vast trove of research on Mr. Trump's business dealings. Using financial experts, Correct the Record and American Bridge have dug into his business career and pored over his personal-disclosure forms looking for material to exploit in a general election.
The groups haven't released any of this research as the GOP primaries have unfolded. They didn't want to assist Mr. Trump's GOP rivals, whom they believed would give Mrs. Clinton a tougher challenge in November, according to a person familiar with their work. Now, they will look for an opportune time to try to put Mr. Trump on the defensive.
Separately, Priorities USA has been preparing for a potential candidacy by Mr. Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz since the summer. The group has conducted focus groups and polling on Mr. Trump and other potential opponents.
Having raised $50 million through January, Priorities USA is planning several lines of attack against the Republican front-runner. It will try to draw attention to his temperament, his treatment of women and his suitability as commander in chief, as well as his business dealings, said a person familiar with its plans.
Taking aim at Mr. Trump's statements about women poses risks, as Mrs. Clinton discovered when she faulted his use of a vulgar Yiddish term in December. Referring to his remark that she got ""schlonged"" by Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump has ""a penchant for sexism."" Mr. Trump quickly invoked former President Bill Clinton's history with women, including his impeachment for allegedly lying about his affair with a White House intern. That retort ended the back-and-forth.
""He punched back at her 10 times harder, and you don't hear that talk anymore,"" said Mr. Lewandowski. ""She understood that he was not, quote-unquote, a typical politician.""
Mrs. Clinton's allies say they see no advantage in Mrs. Clinton taking part in a slugfest with Mr. Trump. Still, they say they are prepared to step into a fray.
""There are things that a campaign won't want to do that need to get done,"" said David Brock, the founder of both Correct the Record and American Bridge. ""They'll need a lot of surrogates to say things you don't want the candidate saying.""

Election 2016: Clinton Wins Missouri Primary,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774104015?accountid=12768,"It's official: Hillary Clinton swept all five states that voted on Tuesday.
The Associated Press called Missouri for Mrs. Clinton just after 6 p.m. ET on Thursday, after an extraordinarily close race against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
With 100% of precincts reporting, the former secretary of state had 49.6% of the vote to Mr. Sanders's 49.4%. Mrs. Clinton beat him by just 1,531 votes out of more than 619,000 votes cast.
On Tuesday night, she was also declared the winner in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Illinois, but Missouri was too close to call.
Missouri has 71 delegates up for grabs, the fewest of any state voting on Tuesday. The state awards delegates proportionally. Candidates need 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination.
A win for Mrs. Clinton in Missouri is also a symbolic victory, because the state was one where Mr. Sanders campaigned hard and saw potential for a win.
Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, held campaign events across the state ahead of the primary.

Election 2016: Clinton Allies See Challenges Ahead,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773764788?accountid=12768,"After capturing at least four important states this week, Hillary Clinton has all but locked down the Democratic nomination and, barring a disastrous stumble, will face the Republican nominee in the general election in November.
So what have Democrats learned about their putative nominee after 29 contests thus far? As the battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders progressed, the former secretary of state grew stronger as a candidate, but she displayed vulnerabilities that a Republican ticket could potentially exploit.
Her debate performances strengthened, she developed a clearer message, and she revived parts of Barack Obama's voting coalition by fully embracing the president's record and legacy. She said recently she isn't a natural-born politician in the mold of her husband, former President Bill Clinton -- an admission that might help her seem more genuine to voters.
And after getting a scare from Mr. Sanders, her supporters said she showed resilience that will prove helpful once the general-election race begins.
""Bernie has made Hillary a much better candidate,"" said Patti Solis Doyle, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager in the 2008 presidential race. ""She has been able to fight for her candidacy, been able to stumble and make corrections. She's been able to go at it one-on-one on the debate stage and really hone those skills again.""
Clinton allies have also identified some warning signs that could spell trouble in the fall.
It is one thing to win over fellow Democrats. When the general election rolls around, Mrs. Clinton will also need to attract independents -- something she has struggled to do thus far.
In Michigan, for example, Mr. Sanders scored the biggest upset of the race by winning 71% of independent voters, compared with 28% for Mrs. Clinton. The pattern was similar in Missouri, one of the five states that votedon Tuesday and the toughest fight of the night for Mrs. Clinton. The Associated Press deemed the race too close to call as ofWednesday.
Had she done better among independents in the state, she likely would have notched a clear win. Independents accounted for about a quarter of the vote in Missouri, and Mrs. Clinton won just one-third of them, exit polls showed.
A bright spot for Mrs. Clinton has been the loyalty of African-American voters. She swept the South with overwhelming support among blacks. One question is whether these voters will feel motivated to cast ballots in November, when big turnouts in Florida, Virginia and Ohio will be key to swing-state victories.
Wall Street Journal-NBC News surveys show that as of last month, 58% of African-Americans described themselves as very excited about the election. By contrast, at the same point in the 2008 election, when Mr. Obama was a candidate, more than 80% of African-Americans were very excited about the contest.
Another question is why Democratic turnout is down. Republicans seem riveted by the emergence of Donald Trump as a political force in their party -- and they are showing up in greater numbers than in 2012. On the Democratic side, participation isn't as strong. A Journal-NBC analysis shows that as of early this month, turnout was down 42% compared with 2008, when Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama vied for the nomination. On the Republican side, turnout is up by 40% on 2012.
Ohio is a bellwether state, coveted as a general-election prize. Mrs. Clinton won easily there on Tuesday, while on the GOP side the state's governor, John Kasich, beat back a challenge from Mr. Trump. Turnout in Ohio was down 46% on the Democratic side compared with 2008 -- and up 69% among Republicans compared with 2012, according to data compiled by Public Opinion Strategies, a GOP polling firm.
But the numbers may not tell the whole story. Democratic enthusiasm could surge in the event of a Clinton-Trump showdown.
""Despite whatever lukewarm sentiment Democrats may have for Hillary Clinton, all of the presidential polling to date indicates those same voters have very negative impressions of Donald Trump,"" said Neil Newhouse, a co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies.""That negative sentiment could help Secretary Clinton rally Democratic support and energize her party's turnout.""
Hanging over Mrs. Clinton's White House run is her use of a private email account and server during her time at the State Department. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the transmission of classified material from her network.
Over the course of the campaign Mrs. Clinton has at times sounded defensive in describing her actions, and she has yet to establish a consistent answer to the continuing questions about them.
Last September, she apologized and said she had made a mistake.
Four months later, at a town-hall event, she was less contrite. ""I'm not willing to say it was an error in judgment because nothing I did was wrong,"" Mrs. Clinton said.

Election 2016: RNC Sues to Obtain Clinton's Messages,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771796059?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- The Republican National Committee on Wednesday filed two lawsuits seeking access to Hillary Clinton's records, potentially opening a new chapter in the continuing legal saga over her decision to use a personal email server while secretary of state.
The RNC lawsuits, which seek access to a wide variety of records related to Mrs. Clinton's time in office, are the most direct legal challenge brought by Republican Party officials seeking access to Mrs. Clinton's records from her time in government.
The litigation could give Republican Party operatives access to a stockpile of government records generated by Mrs. Clinton and her aides going into a hotly contested general election campaign.
The first lawsuit seeks access to all text and BlackBerry messages sent and received by Mrs. Clinton during her time at the State Department. Republicans also are seeking all emails sent and received by several top aides to Mrs. Clinton, including her former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, top policy staffer Jake Sullivan, and technology consultant Bryan Pagliano.
A second case asks for any communications between State Department officials and Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign after she left office in 2013. Mrs. Clinton is the leading Democratic candidate for president. Both lawsuits cite the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA.
Any emails, text messages or other records generated by Mrs. Clinton or her aides related to official business are considered public records and are eligible for release under public records laws. Those records were requested by the RNC under FOIA directly with the State Department last year, but it didn't produce any records within the period of time allowed by law -- opening the door to the lawsuits.
The State Department's handling of Mrs. Clinton's records has generated dozens of other lawsuits, most of which are still in continuing litigation. Mrs. Clinton's email archive has already been made public, after a lawsuit by a Vice News reporter. Her email policy also has prompted an FBI investigation and independent reviews from the inspectors general of the State Department and the intelligence community.
A State Department official declined to comment about the RNC lawsuits, citing a policy against commenting on continuing legal disputes.
""This frivolous lawsuit is just another attempt by Republicans and right-wing groups to try to hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign because she is the candidate they fear the most in a general election. It is not going to work,"" said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
The lawsuits come as several judges on the D.C. District Court have shown a willingness to allow litigation challenging how and why the State Department permitted Mrs. Clinton to run her own email server and control access to her own records.
In response to a separate lawsuit from the conservative activist group Judicial Watch, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan took the rare step of permitting discovery in a FOIA case -- opening the possibility that Mrs. Clinton or her top aides could be forced to testify under oath.
In another case, a different judge ordered the State Department to speed releases of her emails so Democratic voters would have access to it before casting ballots or caucusing for president.

"Election 2016: Clinton, Sanders Spar Over Immigration --- Democratic rivals debate long-ago votes and the intricacies of each other's record",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771796031?accountid=12768,"MIAMI -- Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders faced off Wednesday, a day after he scored a crucial win in the Michigan presidential primary, sparring over immigration and making direct appeals to Latino voters ahead of next week's contest in Florida.
The Democratic candidates delved into the details of immigration law, invoking long-ago votes and critiquing the intricacies of each other's record. Mr. Sanders reflected on his immigrant heritage, and both candidatescited spots in the other's record that are out of step with Latino voters and immigration-rights activists.
Mrs. Clinton was questioned about the right way to handle the influx of Central American children at the border. Mr. Sanders was under fire for his opposition to the 2007 bill that would have legalized people in the U.S. illegally.
Under aggressive questioning from Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, Mrs. Clinton promised not to deport children already living in the U.S., and to target for deportation criminals and those posing a risk. Mr. Sanders also pledged not to send children away.
But the former secretary of state stuck to her position that children newly entering the country illegally should be sent back if they don't meet qualifications for asylum or other programs that would allow them to stay legally.
The eighth Democratic debate yielded few revelations, often covering well-trodden ground. Although the candidates disagreed sharply on several issues, their tone was less combative than in Sunday's matchup in Michigan.
Mrs. Clinton was pressed to explain why many voters still have doubts about whether they can trust her. In Michigan, about 60% of Democratic voters said they viewed her as honest and trustworthy, compared with 80% who said the same of Mr. Sanders, according to ABC exit polls.
""Obviously, it's painful for me to hear that, and I do take responsibility,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""When you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility.""
She said that she would work to demonstrate that people could count on her, adding that she isn't a natural politician like her husband or President Barack Obama.
For his part, Mr. Sanders tried to clarify the difference between an ""establishment politician,"" which he has dubbed Mrs. Clinton, and a ""career politician"" like himself. He said the difference is what he has focused his career on, citing his independence from Wall Street and the drug and fossil-fuel industries.
During the immigration discussion, the candidates were asked a question by a woman who identified herself as a Guatemalan immigrant whose husband had been deported. She asked the candidates what they would do to keep families together. Mrs. Clinton praised the woman for having the ""courage"" to ask the question and called for more Americans to hear such stories.
Mrs. Clinton also took several opportunities to refocus the discussion on Mr. Sanders's 2007 vote against the immigration bill.
""Our best chance was in 2007 when [the late Sen.] Ted Kennedy led the charge,"" she said. ""I voted for that bill. Sen. Sanders voted against it.""
Mr. Sanders has said during this campaign that he opposed the bill because a guest-worker program included was akin to slavery. But the debate moderators showed a video of him from the time, where he cites concerns that the new workers would drive down wages.
Mr. Sanders replied that he worked to improve the program and was able to support the 2013 version of the bill.
Mrs. Clinton shot back with a list of immigrant advocates who backed the 2007 version, saying they never would have supported ""modern slavery."" ""That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill,"" she said.
Both candidates declined to label GOP front-runner Donald Trump a ""racist"" in response to a direct question about his references to Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers. Still, they hurled several other criticisms Mr. Trump's way. Mrs. Clinton attacked his ""trafficking in prejudice and paranoia.""
Mr. Sanders recalled Mr. Trump's efforts in the so-called birther movement to ""delegitimize the president.""
He noted that his own father was born in Poland, yet ""nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate,"" and that was probably because of the ""color of my skin.""

Clinton's Email Jeopardy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770472620?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's Super Tuesday victory gives her a clear path to the Democratic presidential nomination, but Bernie Sanders has never been her biggest obstacle to the White House. Her real liability is an email scandal that has put her in legal jeopardy.
Camp Clinton is arguing that the State Department's Monday release of the final batch of emails ends the controversy over her private server. Yet that release is merely the end of one judicially mandated exercise overseen by a bureaucracy friendly to the former Secretary of State. The real action is in the courts, the FBI and Justice Department.
But even the friendly State Department review has been damaging. Of 30,000 emails Mrs. Clinton turned over to State, we now know that 2,093 were classified as ""confidential"" or ""secret."" Another 22 were classified ""top secret"" -- and State withheld their contents from public release. Mrs. Clinton keeps claiming these were ""retroactively"" classified, but that's been vigorously disputed by intelligence community members, who note that at least some of the top-secret emails refer to intelligence projects classified from the beginning.
The latest release provides fresh evidence that Mrs. Clinton knew her server held national secrets. In one email from April 2012, aide Jake Sullivan forwarded Mrs. Clinton a blog post from a jihadist group. Mrs. Clinton replied: ""If not classified or otherwise inappropriate, can you send to the NY Times reporters who interviewed me today?""
The fact that Mrs. Clinton had to ask if this one was classified suggests she knew that people were sending sensitive information to her unsecure server. The new email dump also shows then-Sen. John Kerry sending Mrs. Clinton intelligence he'd obtained from top Pakistani generals.
There's more to come. Federal judges have spent the past year doing what the State Department wouldn't -- that is, upholding the Freedom of Information Act. Judge Emmet Sullivan recently granted Judicial Watch discovery into whether State and Mrs. Clinton deliberately thwarted FOIA laws.
Judge Sullivan said from the bench: ""Here you have Mrs. Clinton and [Clinton aide Huma] Abedin and their private counsel deciding, after neither Mrs. Clinton nor Ms. Abedin were government employees, what emails are federal records, and what emails are not. It just boggles the mind that the State Department allowed this circumstance to arise in the first place."" Yes it does.
Discovery could lead to depositions, interrogatories and new documents that show who approved Mrs. Clinton's unsecure email arrangement, and who tried to conceal it. Judge Sullivan said he may also issue a subpoena requiring Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin to turn over the entire email system they used.
Many other lawsuits are also proceeding and could provide answers to the many questions that Mrs. Clinton has dodged. Did she turn over all her work email? How many did she edit before giving them to State? Who had access to the server containing confidential information? Was her email hacked by foreign governments or criminals?
All of this is presumably also part of the FBI's investigation into Mrs. Clinton's mishandling of classified information. Attorney General Loretta Lynch last week largely dodged Congressional questions about the Clinton probe, though she did divulge that ""career"" attorneys are working with the FBI. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Justice has granted immunity to Bryan Pagliano, the former State Department employee who set up the private server at Mrs. Clinton's New York home in 2009. This suggests that a grand jury may be empaneled if it isn't underway.
Now that Mrs. Clinton is the odds-on Democratic nominee, the political stakes of all this are enormous. One excuse we are likely to hear is that Mrs. Clinton shouldn't be held responsible for others who sent her classified information, as California Senator Dianne Feinstein recently said. In other words, let Mrs. Clinton's aides take the fall.
But those aides -- and the country -- wouldn't be in this mess if Mrs. Clinton hadn't set up an off-grid account to evade disclosure laws and protect her messages from public scrutiny when she ran for President. Her employees can hardly be blamed for using a system she designed, and Mrs. Clinton was responsible as the senior official for knowing the classification rules.
With Donald Trump emerging as the probable GOP nominee, the political and media temptation in Washington will be to protect Mrs. Clinton and legally excuse her behavior. But the law applies equally to everyone if it means anything. These investigations need to follow their honest course and hold Mrs. Clinton accountable for her actions. The country can handle the political fallout.

Election 2016: Clinton Happy to Get Support of Party Brass,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769404953?accountid=12768,"MINNEAPOLIS -- Being too cozy with the establishment wing of the party has been anathema to many Republican presidential candidates this year. Not so on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton has leaned on the party however she can.
An army of surrogates, from senators to local and state officials, have rallied to Mrs. Clinton's cause in recent weeks, providing high-profile firepower to help the former secretary of state fend off Sen. Bernie Sanders's insurgent campaign.Democratic officeholders and party stalwarts have done everything from knocking on doors to appearing in Mrs. Clinton's stead.
Key Democrats helped Mrs. Clinton romp to victory in South Carolina. And with 11 states holding primaries and caucuseson Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton's team of surrogates worked to ensure that her message resonated across the country.
The Democratic establishment's impact on the Clinton-Sanders race stands in sharp contrast to the Republican presidential campaign, which has already felled a number of candidates closely aligned with the party brass amid the rise of Donald Trump, the embodiment of the antiestablishment wave.
Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist, said the dynamic highlights a disconnect between how voters view their own parties.
""Republicans in particular have had it with elected officials,"" he said. ""Among Democrats, there's anger, but very little of it is directed toward elected officials.""
The difference between the two parties came into sharp relief in South Carolina, where Republican former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called upon a ""who's who"" of the Republican establishment, including his brother, former President George W. Bush, and his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush.
The result: Mr. Bush finished a distant fourth, with less than 8% of the vote. He ended his campaign as soon as the results were tallied.
Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, was buoyed in the state by an assist from leading Democrats and by some well-timed endorsements. Rep. James Clyburn, the unofficial dean of the South Carolina Democratic Party, had pledged to remain neutral in the Democratic contest, but just days before his state's primary, he threw his support behind the former secretary of state. The political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed her as well, as did a long list of state legislators.
The strong show of support before the South Carolina primary, particularly from African-American leaders, helped Mrs. Clinton solidify support from black voters, who made up more than half of the electorate inSaturday'scontest. The former secretary of state cruised to victory, winning by 48 percentage points.
Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, attributed the divergent fates to Mrs. Clinton's deep connections to Democrats in the state and growing antipathy among rank-and-file Republicans toward party leaders.
""I hear from Republicans that they feel as if the establishment has betrayed them; the establishment isn't fighting for what they believe in,"" he said. ""That's part of the antiestablishment tenor on the Republican side, and I don't think that's the feeling on the Democratic side.""
David Winston, a Republican strategist, said that the dynamic on the Republican side has devolved into a contest of who can make the most outrageous statement, and that has overshadowed endorsements, undercutting the influence of leading Republicans.
""The whole focus of the discourse has been trying to get attention,"" he said. ""The most outrageous statement gets the attention.""
Mr. Winston noted one exception, though, pointing to South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's decision to back Sen. Marco Rubio, a last-minute endorsement that helped the Florida senator to a second-place finish.
More of the Republican establishment has begun to coalesce around Mr. Rubio in recent days in an effort to derail Mr. Trump, so far with little success. The former reality-TV star maintains a commanding lead in the polls.

"Trump, Clinton Pile Up Victories --- GOP front-runner wins Super Tuesday contests, but Cruz takes two states, Rubio one, guaranteeing bruising race will continue",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769404665?accountid=12768,"New York businessman Donald Trump won Republican primaries Tuesday from the Deep South to New England, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took his home state and Oklahoma, ensuring that the race for the GOP nomination will stretch into the spring.
The Republican front-runner won contests in at least seven states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia -- bolstering his claim on the nomination. Still, the pockets of resistance in others gave a glimmer of hope to detractors desperate for another candidate to take on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who also rolled to a series of victories on Super Tuesday.
The problem for Mr. Trump's rivals -- as it has been since the voting began -- is that there are too many of them for voters to coalesce behind a single alternative to the New York billionaire. In the past week, opponents have dramatically intensified their attacks on Mr. Trump after he steamrolled rivals in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.
Tuesday's results, however, reinforced Mr. Trump's argument that he is building a durable coalition of GOP primary voters fed up with politics as usual that may bolt the party if he isn't the nominee. ""We have expanded the Republican Party,"" Mr. Trump declared Tuesday night at a rally at his resort Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. ""I am a unifier.""
He promised that he would work with some of the same GOP leaders in Congress, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have been skittish about his rise. ""I'm sure I'm going to get along with him, and if I don't, he's going to pay a big price,"" Mr. Trump said of the Wisconsin lawmaker.
Mr. Trump's victories Tuesday are all the more impressive because, for the first time in the race, he faced concerted attacks from his chief Republican rivals. He continues to defy the laws of presidential politics, courting controversies that few other politicians could survive.
Republicans who appreciate his candor continue to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt even when he lands in hot water, as he did over the weekend when he seemed reluctant to reject the support of a former Ku Klux Klan leader
""I know Donald's going to make some mistakes when he gets to Washington, but who hasn't?"" said Ducky Wall, 77, a retired golf pro from Georgia who voted for Mr. Trump. ""I think he can shake things up.""
But a handful of close contests Tuesday exposed some fissures in that support, as rivals, elected officials and some of the party's most prominent donors ganged up on the Republican who has spent much of the race insulting influential figures in the party. An anti-Trump group hosted a fundraising call Tuesday that drew some of the party's biggest donors, including hedge-fund titan Paul Singer, a supporter of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
Tuesday's results give Mr. Cruz new grounds to argue he is the leading alternative to Mr. Trump, beating the front-runner in Oklahoma and the Lone Star State, a month after his victory in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. The wins reinforced Mr. Cruz's argument that he is the only Republican who can topple Mr. Trump. But Mr. Rubio did win one state, topping Messrs. Cruz and Trump in the Minnesota caucuses.
""After tonight we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump,"" Mr. Cruz said at his victory party.
Mr. Cruz benefited from voters skeptical about Mr. Trump. ""I'll weep, if he is the nominee,"" said Cruz supporter Julie Earl, of McKinney, Texas, referring to Mr. Trump. Added Terry Sauls of McKinney, ""He's a Democrat in Republican boots.""
Tuesday marked the first chance for the remaining GOP contenders to test their strength across different segments of the electorate. Roughly 60% of Republican voters in Virginia graduated from college and support legal status for immigrants in the country illegally. In Alabama, 54% of GOP primary voters said undocumented immigrants should be deported.
The rules of the GOP nominating contests could muddy the results because most of Tuesday's states divide delegates proportionality. The rules differ in each, but candidates that clear certain thresholds will qualify for delegates. And no candidate had yet to clear the 50% threshold in statewide balloting to claim the bulk of any one state's delegates. The complex delegate math made it too tough to determine the exact total each candidate won Tuesday.
The race now turns to a pair of swing states that are home to two of Mr. Trump's remaining rivals-Mr. Rubio in Florida and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Mr. Trump may be able to knock either from the race by beating them on their home turf.
Questions arose late Tuesday about the viability of Messrs. Kasich and Rubio's campaigns. On Tuesday, Mr. Rubio's campaign manager told donors in Washington, D.C., that they were committed to going all the way to the Republican convention in Cleveland in July.
For the first time in this race, Messrs. Cruz and Rubio over the past week took on the front-runner at the same time. The two senators, along with Mr. Kasich, are trying to outlast each other to set up a head-to-head match up with Mr. Trump. Time is dwindling for a candidate other than the former reality TV star to collect enough delegates to win.
Mr. Trump's February winning streak triggered a backlash from his rivals and other elected GOP officials petrified by the prospect of the brash billionaire topping the ticket. His detractors are desperately trying to hatch strategies to deny him the nomination, including a bruising convention fight that could alienate his supporters.
No Republican has been more vocal than Mr. Rubio. After spending much of the past year trying to avoid direct confrontations with his rivals for the nomination, Mr. Rubio has resorted to calling Mr. Trump a ""con artist,"" questioning his wealth and even suggesting the front-runner urinated on himself during the most recent candidates' debate last Thursday night.
Mr. Trump has responded to the broadsides by referring to Mr. Rubio as ""Little Marco"" and dismissing his digs as a feeble attempt to claw his way back into the race. In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Mr. Trump called on Mr. Rubio to exit the race. ""I think he has to get out,"" he said.
Mr. Trump found himself embroiled in a potentially more serious controversy over the weekend when he hesitated to disavow the support of David Duke, a former Grand Wizard in the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Trump eventually rejected Mr. Duke's support and blamed his initial response on a bad earpiece during his CNN interview.
But the episode underscored Republicans' fear that Mr. Trump may imperil GOP candidates at every level of the ballot, if primary voters make him the nominee.
On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton used the David Duke episode to tell a Minneapolis crowd she was ""very disappointed"" Mr. Trump didn't immediately disavow the former Klan leader's support. ""I'm just speaking out against bigotry and bullying wherever I hear it,"" she said. ""And I hear a lot of it from the Republican candidates.""
Mr. Trump's Republican detractors have grown louder and more strident as the front-runner gets closer to clinching the nomination. A pair of retiring GOP congressmen -- Reps. Reid Ribble of Wisconsin and Scott Rigell of Virginia -- joined South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford and Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo in vowing not to vote for Mr. Trump, even if he becomes the nominee. They followed former Republican National Committee Chairmen Mel Martinez and Ken Mehlman, among other current and former elected and party officials.
""Trump is a bully, unworthy of our nomination,"" Mr. Rigell wrote his constituents on Monday night. ""To live with a clear conscience, I will not support a nominee so lacking in judgment, temperament and character needed to be our commander-in-chief.""

Blacks Bolster Clinton in South,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768525565?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton rode overwhelming African-American support to a landslide victory in South Carolina's Democratic presidential primary over the weekend, and she is hoping black voters can next deliver lopsided wins in a swath of Southern states that vote Tuesday.
It is a remarkable twist given that Mrs. Clinton's last presidential campaign ended with her relationship with black leaders and voters in tatters.
Mrs. Clinton solidified her status as the party's front-runner by trouncing Sen. Bernie Sanders in South Carolina, with 74% support compared with 26% for her rival. Six in 10 of the primary participants were African-American, and she won 86% of their votes, according to exit polls reported by CNN and other media. That means she could have won the state without a single white vote.
The Clinton camp is hoping for big wins on Tuesday in Alabama and Georgia, where black voters made up more than half of the primary electorate in 2008, according to exit polls. Mrs. Clinton on Sunday visited two African-American churches in Memphis, Tenn., and planned stops before Tuesday's vote in Nashville, Arkansas and Virginia.
The minority-rich Southern states where Mrs. Clinton holds the stronger hand will allocate a combined 571 delegates to the convention on Tuesday. While Mr. Sanders could post a strong showing in some states this week, including his home state of Vermont, the states in which he hopes to be competitive will award just 288 delegates.
Just eight years ago, many African-Americans were offended by what they saw as racially tinged remarks by both Mrs. Clinton and her husband during the drawn-out nomination battle with then-Sen. Barack Obama. Her road back to their good wishes began almost as soon as her contest with Mr. Obama ended.
At the Democratic National Convention in the summer of 2008, she threw him her support, and after he was elected, she served as his secretary of state. Later, she nurtured relationships with quiet gestures and personal outreach to African-Americans.
For decades the Clintons both had close black friends and advisers, and author Toni Morrison half-jokingly dubbed Bill Clinton the nation's first black president.
""Bill Clinton is the only person I know, black or white, who knows every verse to the black national anthem,"" Tavis Smiley, a television and radio host, said in an interview. ""He just gets black people.""
Mrs. Clinton enjoyed strong African-American support at the outset of the 2008 cycle, but after Mr. Obama gained traction, most black voters swung to him and the historic opportunity to elect the first African-American president.
Ahead of the 2008 South Carolina primary, which Mr. Obama was clearly about to win, Mr. Clinton dismissed his success in the state by comparing him with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who won the state's Democratic presidential primary twice but never secured the nomination.
In that same primary, Mrs. Clinton appeared to diminish the importance of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. by saying it took President Lyndon Johnson to get the Civil Rights Act into law.
""A lot of people were genuinely hurt,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil-rights leader and TV and radio host.
Her first big step toward redemption came when she called upon Democrats to unite and elect Mr. Obama at the convention. Her willingness to serve as secretary of state also went a long way toward healing wounds, said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.).
After Mrs. Clinton left office in early 2013, she went to work solidifying her relationships. ""She did a healthy-size portion of reaching out,"" said Minyon Moore, a longtime friend and former aide. ""A lot of African-Americans were on her list.""
Mr. Jeffries remembers receiving a handwritten note from the former New York senator during the 2013 holiday season and being struck by how personal the sentiment was. He had been a junior member of the state legislature when they met.
""Who am I? She took time to figure that out, and it's greatly appreciated,"" he said.
Mr. Sharpton recalls a phone call from Mrs. Clinton on his 60th birthday, in October 2014.
""I said to one of my assistants, 'Aww, maybe she's going to run' "" for president, Mr. Sharpton said. The assistant replied there were lots of reasons that she might remember his birthday, he said.
""I said, 'yeah, but I had 59 other birthdays and she's never called me,' "" he added.
Once she declared her candidacy, Mrs. Clinton put a strong focus on issues of particular concern to the African-American community. She delivered early speeches about bolstering voting rights and ending the ""era of mass incarceration.""
When she released her college affordability plan last summer, it included $25 billion for historically black colleges and universities.
She ran into trouble early when, in recounting an anecdote she heard from her mother, she said, ""all lives matter,"" a phrase that some see as disrespectful of the Black Lives Matter movement. But after that, she met with Black Lives Matter members and with mothers of young black people who died in police custody. This month, she gave a speech in Harlem about systemic racism.
And she has wrapped herself tightly to Mr. Obama, casting herself as the true heir to his legacy.
""She has very astutely and very deftly wrapped herself around the first black president,"" Mr. Smiley said. ""Black people see that, they recognize that and they know that.""

"Election 2016: Polls Point to Big Gains for Trump, Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768525548?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton hold leads in key states up for grabs in Super Tuesday's nominating contests, suggesting the front-runners are poised to pull decisively ahead of their rivals.
Mr. Trump is ahead of his nearest rival by 18 percentage points in Tennessee among likely Republican voters, and by seven points in Georgia, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll taken between Feb. 18 and 25.
Mrs. Clinton has commanding leads in Tennessee and Georgia, as well as in Texas, where she has 59% of the vote, compared with 38% for rival Bernie Sanders.
Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is emerging as Mr. Trump's strongest competitor on Tuesday, leading in the poll with support of 39% of likely voters in Texas -- the state with the most delegates at stake on Tuesday -- compared with 26% for Mr. Trump. The Texas senator is hoping that a strong win in his home state will bolster his argument that he is the only Republican with the support necessary to take on Mr. Trump.
The polls of three Super Tuesday states point to contests that are entering a critical new phase, in which Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have the potential to cement early gains. Given those stakes, both are drawing a battery of attacks from rivals determined to stop them from winning all of the 11 states awarding delegates on Tuesday.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has picked up the support of much of the Republican establishment since former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush left the race, is neck and neck with Mr. Cruz in both Georgia and Tennessee. Mr. Rubio had the support of the 23% of the vote in Georgia, matching Mr. Cruz, the poll found. The Florida senator had the support of 19% of likely voters in Tennessee, compared with 22% for Mr. Cruz.
But the polls, which have a margin of error of between 3.8 and 5 percentage points, found that Mr. Trump was easily ahead of both men, with the support of 30% of voters in Georgia and 40% in Tennessee.
Two other GOP candidates -- retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- each have support in the single digits in the three states.
In the Democratic contest, Mrs. Clinton is dominating the field, based in large part on commanding margins among African-American voters. She leads Mr. Sanders by 34 points in Georgia, where black voters make up a majority of the likely Democratic voting pool, and by 26 points in Tennessee, where African-Americans make up almost a third of the Democratic electorate.
The strengths Mr. Sanders has carried in prior nominating contests are apparent in the new poll. He wins among independent voters who say they'll participate in Democratic primaries in the three states, and carries voters under age 45 in Tennessee and Texas. Those groups helped propel him to a big win in New Hampshire and what essentially was a tie in Iowa.
The Texas poll also shows that Mr. Sanders has made some inroads in the Latino community, with support among 47% of likely Latino voters compared with 52% for Mrs. Clinton.
The polls were conducted before Mr. Trump was endorsed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and before Thursday's GOP debate, in which Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz challenged Mr. Trump's business ethics, conservative credentials, and policy positions.

The Clinton Coronation Resumes,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768524829?accountid=12768,"So much for the Bernie Sanders revolution. Hillary Clinton's blowout victory in South Carolina on Saturday, combined with her huge polling leads in most Super Tuesday states, shows that the Democratic Party coronation has resumed.
Mr. Sanders could muster a mere 26% of South Carolina Democrats. The exit polls say Mrs. Clinton won an almost unbelievable 86% of the black vote, suggesting that she will also sweep the other southern states with heavy African-American populations on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders will presumably win in Vermont, and maybe another state or two, but that won't be nearly enough to stop Mrs. Clinton from cruising to the nomination.
The Democratic contest thus returns to the normalcy of recent decades, which is that a progressive insurgency invariably fails against the establishment favorite. Gary Hart, Bill Bradley, Howard Dean and Mr. Sanders were all favorites of the white gentry left. They lost because they couldn't defeat the government unions or persuade enough African-Americans. Barack Obama was the exception because he could compete for the black vote.
Mrs. Clinton continued to underperform among younger voters, and underlying economic anxiety should concern Democrats going into November. Some 84% of Democrats in South Carolina said they are either very or somewhat worried about the U.S. economy. But the Clinton juggernaut shows that, unlike the GOP, there really is a Democratic establishment composed of powerful interest groups that determine the nominee. Those forces are rallying to defeat Mr. Sanders, whom they view as unelectable.
Barring some new revelation, it looks like only the FBI probe into Hillary's emails and her mishandling of classified information can derail her now. But Republicans shouldn't count on anything coming from President Obama's Justice Department. Mr. Obama has made clear he views a Clinton victory as crucial to his legacy, and only a brave government employee would recommend a criminal charge against a major-party nominee so close to an election.
A Clinton nomination without an indictment or plea bargain also means that Michael Bloomberg is unlikely to make a third-party run. The former New York mayor wouldn't want to be responsible for splitting the center-left vote and electing Donald Trump.
This also means that on present trend the Democratic Party is going to be reasonably unified going into the fall campaign. There's still a question of whether Mrs. Clinton can motivate enough of Mr. Obama's 2012 coalition to come out to vote. But Mr. Obama and her husband will be campaigning for her, making the case that she is the only barrier in the way of Republican control of both Congress and the White House.
Republicans keep telling themselves that Mrs. Clinton is a lousy candidate, and so she is by any conventional measure. Even half of all Democrats find her untrustworthy, and she is as natural on the stump as Velveeta. But an election always come down to a choice, and the GOP is likely to have the harder time uniting behind its eventual nominee, especially if it is Mr. Trump. Then again, if Mrs. Clinton does become our next President, perhaps she can make Chris Christie her Attorney General.",2016-04-26
Election 2016: Clinton Looks to Set a Southern Tone,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768288037?accountid=12768,"ORANGEBURG, S.C. -- Hillary Clinton's Southern firewall appears poised to pass its first test Saturday in South Carolina, where a strong showing could hint at more struggles ahead for Democratic rival Bernie Sanders in many of the Super Tuesday contests.
Mrs. Clinton heads into Saturday's primary with a double-digit lead in the polls and an eye on the Southern states that will vote on Tuesday, including Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Arkansas and Virginia.
Her strength in the region, particularly among its many African-American Democratic voters, has been magnified by the Sanders campaign's decision not to try to match her investment here and elsewhere. Officials in some Super Tuesday states say they still are looking for indications that he is competing in the so-called SEC primary.
A march outside a downtown Nashville coffee shop on Saturday will feature a half-dozen, life-size Bernie Sanders cutouts, but otherwise, there has been little sign of Mr. Sanders himself in Tennessee, Democrats said.
""You kind of get the feel that he doesn't think it's worthwhile coming,"" said Randall Rice, head of the Tennessee Democratic County Chairs Association, who is neutral in the race. ""The Bernie group has come in and set up offices, but he's not been here as far as I know. Hillary has been here a few times.""
Mrs. Clinton will be back in Tennessee on Sunday.
Mr. Sanders held two events in South Carolina late Friday, including a rally with rapper Killer Mike at historically black Claflin University here in Orangeburg. But Mr. Sanders is headed to Minnesota and Texas on Saturday to trumpet his free-college-tuition plan, and he won't be in South Carolina when the election results are announced.
Justin Bamberg, one of a handful of black legislators who endorsed Mr. Sanders in South Carolina, said he wishes the Vermont senator could stay for a victory party, but, ""realistically speaking, how can you get everywhere? You can't.""
Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist who served as the Southern regional director for President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said the reason Mr. Sanders isn't spending as much time in South Carolina as Mrs. Clinton ""is because he now knows you have to develop a broad coalition of support in these Southern states, particularly where there's a high minority voting-age population.""
Tad Devine, a senior strategist for the Sanders campaign, said the senator's best hope of winning South Carolina hinged on nabbing victories in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the first three contests.
Mr. Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, came close in Iowa and lost Nevada. Absent an early trifecta of wins, Mr. Devine said the Sanders campaign now needs to focus on playing the long game and looking ahead to later contests.
""We still believe we have the best message, and while we had the advantage of having Iowa and New Hampshire the first and second states, she has the advantage of having so many states from the South so early in the process,"" Mr. Devine said. ""She'll gain from that. Once that's over, the ball comes back to our court and we start to move into a number of states"" where they expected to do well.
But between then and now, Mrs. Clinton is likely to secure lopsided victories that illustrate her ability to attract the diverse coalition necessary for a Democratic candidate to win the general election. She also will rack up a slew of delegates in the process.
Alabama state Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison said Mrs. Clinton has a strong following among African-American voters there. The former senator and secretary of state has visited multiple times, and she and former President Bill Clinton will be back in the state on Saturday.
African-American voters in Alabama generally have only a vague senseof Mr. Sanders, she said, so the senator's absence in the state ahead of Super Tuesday doesn't help. Some of Mr. Sanders's field organizers visited her office a while back, and she said she told them, ""Quite frankly, I don't really know who he is.""
Mr. Sanders's wife, Jane, disputed suggestions that she and her husband haven't spent time in the South or have written off South Carolina or the region, attributing that narrative to what she called Clinton campaign ""spin."" Mr. Sanders appeared at campaign events in the state on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday, she noted.
""They spend a lot of time spinning, and so that's not accurate,"" she said. We've gone to Alabama -- we were down there for the 50th anniversary of Selma.""
This week, though, Mr. Sanders spent most of his time outside of the South, venturing to Massachusetts, Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Oklahoma.
Clinton campaign officials also asserted that Mr. Sanders had expended significant resources in South Carolina, hiring a large staff and making major ad buys.
""A win in South Carolina for us would be quite meaningful because despite the fact that in recent days Sen. Sanders has focused his travel on Super Tuesday states, it's clear he contested South Carolina very fiercely for a very long time,"" said Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary. ""One could make a judgment that they treated South Carolina as a testing ground for whether they could broaden his appeal and expand his support into a more diverse electorate.""
Mr. Fallon said he is confident Mrs. Clinton would emerge from Tuesday's contests with an advantage in pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders has focused the bulk of his recent efforts on five states -- Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma -- that represent only about one-third of the delegates that will be awarded on Super Tuesday.
""If he is not going to contest states that have a greater percentage of African-Americans and Latinos in them, then the math just won't work for him,"" Mr. Fallon said.

Justice and Clinton's Email Probe,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768101378?accountid=12768,"Attorney General Loretta Lynch this week tried to assure House Republicans about the impartiality of her department's investigation into Hillary Clinton's State Department emails by noting that it would be handled by career government officials. This claim could stand a little parsing.
The probe into her possible mishandling of classified information ""is being handled by career independent law enforcement agents -- FBI agents -- as well as the career independent attorneys in the Department of Justice,"" Ms. Lynch said Wednesday. ""They follow the evidence, they look at the law and they'll make a recommendation to me when the time is appropriate,"" adding that the probe is being ""conducted as every other case.""
That's what they always say, and it is nice to think so. But there's reason to doubt given the example of Justice's investigation into the IRS targeting of conservative groups before the 2012 election. To lead that probe, then Attorney General Eric Holder appointed Barbara Bosserman, a trial attorney in the department's Civil Rights Division.
Ms. Bosserman's appointment was curious given that her area of expertise is civil rights, not tax law. She had also donated $6,100 to President Obama's campaigns and the Obama Victory Fund in 2008 and 2012. That's no small donation on a career employee's salary and suggests some serious political loyalty.
Ms. Bosserman's conflict of interest came to light only after Justice stonewalled congressional requests for information about the status of the IRS probe. The House Oversight Committee then began investigating Justice's investigation. In September 2014 we wrote about the involvement of former department spokesman Brian Fallon, now a press secretary for the Clinton presidential campaign.
The House also discovered that Justice had assigned former IRS tax attorney Andrew Strelka to the case brought against the agency by Z Street, a pro-Israel group that claimed its tax-exempt status had been delayed because of its political leanings. Mr. Strelka had previously served as a presidential management fellow working in the IRS tax-exempt office managed by Lois Lerner, who by the way was also a career government official with clear anti-Republican political leanings. Mr. Strelka was removed from the case before being deposed as a witness.
Justice closed its investigation of the IRS last October with no criminal charges.
We'll hope for the best from Ms. Lynch's career prosecutors, and especially from the FBI.

Election 2016: Clinton's Focus Stays On South Carolina,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768100905?accountid=12768,"KINGSTREE, S.C. -- Hillary Clinton has been crisscrossing South Carolina, with as many as four events a day, showing diligence in the state and loyalty to its African-American voters who could bolster her chances in Saturday's Democratic primary.
In contrast, her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is spending much of his time this week courting college-age voters in Ohio and Oklahoma, an itinerary that could amount to ceding the South and its powerful black voting blocs to Mrs. Clinton. African-American voters will likely make up more than half of the electorate in South Carolina's Democratic primary.
Mrs. Clinton's focus has mostly been on criminal justice reform and income inequality. ""We've got work to do to help more people be able to knock down those barriers that stand in their way,"" she said. ""And that includes taking on systemic racism which is still a problem in America.""
The Sanders campaign is running an energetic ground game in South Carolina, with hundreds of volunteers knocking on doors, piling into the campaign's half-dozen offices and spending hours a week calling voters.
Volunteer Judy Milburn Lake likes to say that ""to see Bernie is to love him,"" and she is disappointed that many South Carolinians haven't had the chance to eyeball Mr. Sanders, who has spent comparatively little time here.
The senator remains relatively unknown to a lot of voters in this state. And with just a day remaining before the primary, many said they were backing Mrs. Clinton by default.
Polls show a decided advantage for the former secretary of state. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll last week, Mrs. Clinton held a 28-percentage-point lead over Mr. Sanders among likely Democratic voters in South Carolina.
Mr. Sanders hasn't abandoned the state. He was in Greenville on Sunday and then Columbia on Tuesday for a CNN event. He held a news conference on poverty with two prominent black legislators Wednesday before setting off to Kansas City, Mo.
Todd Shaw, associate professor of political science and African-American studies at the University of South Carolina, said Mr. Sanders faces a strategic dilemma this week in dividing his time between South Carolina and the states that will hold the next contests. Although a win appears out of reach in South Carolina, ignoring the state ""might look as if you're writing off the black vote,"" he said.
Mr. Sanders is expected to come back to South Carolina Friday.
On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton had the Palmetto State to herself. And, while Mr. Sanders hopscotched from Ohio to Illinois to Michigan, the entire Clinton family deployed across South Carolina. Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton each had a full day's worth of campaign rallies planned, and daughter Chelsea Clinton appeared at her own event.
Mr. Sanders is trying to use surrogates to reach voters. But Sanders supporters privately acknowledge feeling burned when Mr. Sanders said in his Feb. 20 concession speech in Nevada, ""On to SuperTuesday,"" ignoring the primary here.

"Politics Is Not a Crime; If Bob McDonnell is guilty of corruption, then so is Hillary Clinton.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784316086?accountid=12768,"Americans think most politicians are corrupt these days, but sometimes the law needs to protect the normal business of politics against prosecutors who invent law-breaking when it doesn't exist. That's the Supreme Court's task on Wednesday when it hears the appeal of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's corruption conviction.
A jury convicted Mr. McDonnell in 2014 for taking more than $170,000 in gifts from a Richmond businessman who was also a family friend. The gifts included a $50,000 loan, $15,000 to finance their daughter's wedding, fancy dresses, a Rolex watch and vacations. Let us stipulate that this is reckless and sleazy, and that the businessman hoped the Governor would take actions to promote his diet-supplement business.
The legal problem is that Mr. McDonnell never provided much of any quo for the quid. Virginia law lets politicians accept gifts, and prosecutors never charged him with violating state law. They charged him under federal law with performing ""official acts"" to benefit the business, but none of those acts influenced policy or changed a government decision.
Mr. McDonnell was convicted for attending a lunch at the executive mansion where the businessman's company gave out grants to universities, for attending a reception with the businessman, for asking an aide about research pertaining to the company, and for arranging a meeting with his staff and the man.
This stretches the bribery statutes to criminalize the normal transactions of politics. Public officials routinely act as boosters for local businesses. They also frequently meet donors and introduce them to others. Citizens also have the First Amendment right to petition their elected officials. If arranging a meeting for a benefactor qualifies as corruption, prosecutors will be able to target any politician in the country.
Such as Hillary Clinton. As Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton lobbied governments on issues affecting companies that donated to the Clinton Foundation. Then there are the speaking fees for Bill Clinton paid by companies that had interests before the State Department.
In 2010 the Supreme Court grappled with a similar corruption issue in Skilling v U.S., a case about former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling. The case was decided unanimously and a 6-3 majority defined corruption under the Honest Services Fraud statute as bribes and kickbacks. In a concurrence written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, three Justices would have struck down the honest-services law.
""A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it proscribes,"" Justice Scalia wrote. The Honest Services Fraud statute that prohibits ""a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services"" is ""vague, and therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.""
The McDonnell conviction also raises federalism concerns because its elastic definition of bribery could unleash federal prosecutors on state politicians who may be political opponents of the Administration running the Justice Department. For this and other reasons, dozens of former federal and state officials, including more than 80 former state attorneys general, signed amicus briefs on behalf of Mr. McDonnell's appeal.
Justice Scalia's absence will be felt at the Court, but we hope the eight remaining Justices remember the courage of their convictions in Skilling. Bribery requires evidence of a clear exchange of an official action for something of value. Mr. McDonnell's bad judgment was an embarrassing spectacle and he deserves political exile. His conviction deserves skepticism from the Court.",2016-04-27
Election 2016: Clinton Outlines Counterterror Response --- Former secretary of state rebukes GOP rivals' proposals in speech at Stanford,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775302613?accountid=12768,"STANFORD, Calif. -- Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a broad rebuke of her Republican rivals in a counterterrorism speech Wednesday that sought to validate voter fears while advocating targeted use of American power to defeat Islamic State.
She said demonizing Muslims makes it harder to fight terrorism and that condoning torture undermines American values. She condemned calls to withdraw American support for NATO and to ""carpet bomb"" populated areas in hopes of killing terrorists. And she said there is no way to build a wall high enough to block the Internet, where jihadists are recruited.
""Slogans aren't a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire,"" she said, presenting herself as the adult in a room full of bluster and irresponsible rhetoric. ""What America needs is strong, smart, steady leadership to wage and win this struggle.""
The speech at Stanford University came a day after a terrorist attack in Brussels where suicide bombers at the airport and subway detonated explosions that killed 31, wounded 270 others and refocused the presidential campaign on the terrorist threat.
The Democratic front-runner laid out a slate of ideas for battling terrorists at home and abroad, few of them new, while delivering a takedown of the leading Republican presidential candidates. She called for an ""intelligence surge"" and said governments should reconsider protocols in airports and areas outside security zones.
She lambasted Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's call for more aggressively policing of Muslim neighborhoods, saying Muslim-Americans are vital to detecting and reporting evolving plots. She said Muslim nations are critical allies in the fight against terror that don't appreciate ""offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims.""
She also offered a vigorous and lengthy defense of American alliances including NATO, which she called the most successful in history, and said GOP front-runner Donald Trump's call to scale back American support for the European-based security organization would only enable Russian President Vladimir Putin to extend his power. ""Putin already hopes to divide Europe. If Mr. Trump gets his way it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin,"" she said.
Mr. Trump responded to Mrs. Clinton's speech in a Twitter post. ""Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She's been in office fighting terror for 20 years -- and look where we are,"" he wrote.
A representative for Mr. Cruz didn't reply to requests for comment.
Mrs. Clinton ignored her Democratic rival for the presidential nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, entirely. He has painted her as overly hawkish and repeatedly reminded audiences that she voted to authorize the 2003 invasion of Iraq. With a commanding lead in delegates, Mrs. Clinton has increasingly trained her focus on her prospective Republican rivals.
Mrs. Clinton sprinkled her speech with recollections from her four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state. That service has given her experience and an understanding of global complexities, but may be a burden if voters blame Mr. Obama -- and by extension, Mrs. Clinton -- for world problems, including the growth of Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Brussels attacks.
Responding to the speech, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee connected Mrs. Clinton to Mr. Obama and said they both had failed to take the terrorist threat seriously enough. ""Hillary Clinton and President Obama have been wrong about ISIS at every turn, which has resulted in more attacks and a more dangerous world,"" said a statement from RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.
At the top of her remarks, she acknowledged American anxiety, but said those fears could be countered with measured, specific ideas. Among them: stepped-up U.S. air power in Iraq and Syria to counter Islamic State, though no ground troops, and enlisting technology companies to track terrorist social media networks.
She said that European nations still aren't alerting one another when they turn away suspected terrorists at their borders, despite pledges to better share information made after the attacks last year in Paris. ""It's actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors,"" she said.

Election 2016: Clinton Continues Momentum by Securing Big Prize,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775088545?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton won the biggest prize in Tuesday's Democratic presidential contests, securing a victory in Arizona's primary and pulling further ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the chase for delegates.
Mr. Sanders was expected to fare better in Idaho and Utah, which held caucuses Tuesday. But Mrs. Clinton's victory in Arizona, which awards more delegates than the other two states combined, further dimmed Mr. Sanders's hopes of regaining momentum in the race for the Democratic nomination.
Mrs. Clinton celebrated her victory at a rally in Seattle, where she was campaigning ahead of Saturday's Washington state caucuses. She looked past Mr. Sanders entirely and sharply criticized Republicans, particularly presidential front-runner Donald Trump, and said voters understand that the race under way isn't just a choice between candidates.
""This is a contest between fundamentally different views of our country, our values and our future,"" she said.
With the primary season half over, Mr. Sanders entered Tuesday's three nominating contests in urgent need of lopsided wins and a strategy for broadening his coalition beyond the young and largely white group of voters who have boosted him so far. He had devoted significant time and resources to Arizona, holding events there almost every day during the last week, traveling to the Mexican border and investing in television ads.
Mrs. Clinton was helped by Arizona rules that limited participation in the primary to Democratic Party members, excluding independent voters, who have tended to back Mr. Sanders. The state's large share of older voters, who strongly backed Mrs. Clinton in prior primaries, also made the state friendly territory for her. The state awards 75 delegates on a proportional basis.
Mr. Sanders continued to project confidence late Tuesday night, saying that his bid for the White House is generating energy and excitement.
""When we began this campaign, we were considered a fringe candidacy,"" the Vermont senator said after Mrs. Clinton was projected by the Associated Press to win Arizona. ""Well, 10 months later, we have now won 10 primaries and caucuses and, unless I'm very mistaken, we're going to win a couple more tonight.""
Mr. Sanders's campaign has argued that the second half of the primary season, starting with Tuesday's contests and heavy on Western states, would take the race to more favorable terrain. He not only needs to win states but to carry them by large margins in order to maximize his share of delegates.
Mrs. Clinton had swept through the South, then won all five states that held primaries last week. A look at the calendar reveals limited opportunities for the Vermont senator to eat into Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead.
Mr. Sanders could score several victories in Western states and beyond. But narrowing Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead will require him to notch landslides that produce big shares of available delegates.
An examination ofthe 28 contests stretching from now until mid-Juneshows opportunities for Mrs. Clinton to hold her lead or even build on it. As a presidential candidate in 2008, she faced then-Sen. Barack Obama in each of those states. She won 12 contests; Mr. Obama won 16.
But her 12 victories came in states and one territory, Puerto Rico, that in the 2016 primaries account for more than 1,400 delegates. By contrast, the 16 contests she lost in her last campaign offer only about 600 delegates this year.
To assess how the next phase of the race suits Mrs. Clinton, consider California. The state's June primary will allocate the biggest prize of the entire race, 475 delegates. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton won California easily, defeating Mr. Obama by eight points.
David Wasserman, a delegate analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, wrote recently that Mr. Sanders could string together several victories in the West and then stall in the more diverse Northeastern states. ""If there is bad news for Clinton, it's that the next month of primaries could give the false impression that Sanders is on track for a big comeback,"" Mr. Wasserman wrote.
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has described the former secretary of state's delegate lead as ""nearly insurmountable.""

"With Security Back in Focus, Trump, Clinton Win Arizona",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775087362?accountid=12768,"The deadly terror attacks in Brussels abruptly refocused the agenda of the presidential race Tuesday, jolting the dwindling group of candidates into a renewed debate over who was best-equipped to protect America.
Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who won Tuesday's Arizona primary, suggested the attacks, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility, vindicated his aggressive rhetoric about Muslims and others. He also called for new laws that would allow torture when interrogating terror suspects. Leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who won her party's primary in Arizona, reiterated her experience as secretary of state and adopted her own tough tone by suggesting Europeans need to do more to control their borders.
It was Republican Sen. Ted Cruz who offered the starkest new plan, suggesting police in the U.S. should more aggressively police Muslim communities. ""We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized,"" Mr. Cruz said.
Under Mr. Cruz's plan, which Mr. Trump said he supports, the selection of which neighborhoods would receive increased patrols would depend on input from law enforcement, a person familiar with the proposal said.
Some of Mr. Cruz's backers had questions about the plan. ""Generally every neighborhood is patrolled -- that's what local law enforcement does,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R., Kan.), who has endorsed Mr. Cruz. ""I'm not quite sure what he has in mind, but without a doubt there's been no greater defender, no constitutional scholar greater than Ted Cruz in this race.""
The attacks came as Utah was also holding its nominating contest Tuesday, while Democrats in Idaho held their caucuses.
This isn't the first time terrorist attacks have reshaped the contours of the presidential campaign. Deadly assaults last year in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., appeared to play to the strengths of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in their respective primary races.
Recently, the focus had returned to subjects like trade and the economy, but the explosions in Brussels made each of the campaigns immediately pivot. Mr. Cruz, in second place to Mr. Trump by GOP convention delegates, held two news conferences. Mrs. Clinton made unscheduled television appearances and hastily scheduled a Wednesday speech at Stanford University on counterterrorism.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, called on President Barack Obama to cut short his historic trip to Cuba to address the issue.
The attacks have the potential to further boost Mr. Trump, whose tough talk and far-reaching proposals aided him following previous terrorist attacks. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that investigators should use harsh interrogation techniques to pry information from Salah Abdeslam, who was arrested in Brussels last week and is accused of taking part in last year's Paris attacks.
""He may be talking, but he'll talk a lot faster with the torture,"" Mr. Trump said on CNN.
Mrs. Clinton, for her part, said the U.S. needs ""to toughen our surveillance, our interception of communication"" in order to prevent new attacks.
In calling for law enforcement to secure Muslim neighborhoods, Mr. Cruz waded into a policing tactic that some warned could further alienate religious minorities and violate people's rights.
Lorenzo Vidino, director of the program on extremism at George Washington University, said it was wrong to portray entire neighborhoods as overrun by terrorist networks. ""This seems well beyond the scope, and can you imagine what kind of message it sends?"" Mr. Vidino said.
The Cruz campaign rejected such criticism, saying law enforcement needed to act more aggressively and ignore ""political correctness.""
Mr. Cruz added, ""If you have a neighborhood that is plagued by gang activity, it is standard and good law enforcement to stop the gang members and take them off the street.""
The violent emergence of Islamic State in 2014, and its ability to inspire or direct massacres on five continents, has consumed law enforcement, intelligence, and military networks around the world. The next president will inherit these threats.
In the days after the December terror attack in California, Mr. Trump galvanized support by proposing to temporarily stop the immigration of Muslims into the U.S. The proposal spooked many GOP leaders but appeared to resonate with many primary voters.
The idea complemented other parts of Mr. Trump's foreign-policy platform, which would tighten U.S. borders and diminish engagement in the Middle East. On Monday, Mr. Trump took another step, suggesting the U.S. should contribute less to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and saying more of the NATO burden should be borne by European allies.
Messrs. Cruz and Kasich pounced on that recommendation following the attacks in Brussels.
""We must strengthen our alliances as our way of life,"" Mr. Kasich said in a statement.
For Mrs. Clinton, the Brussels attacks force a direct confrontation with a thorny question -- how to balance the need for government antiterrorism surveillance with the privacy rights of Americans.
Facing a liberal challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, Mrs. Clinton has long stressed the importance of civil liberties and the need for government restraint. In December, she gave a speech in Minnesota calling on the government and technology companies to ""start working together to keep us safe from terrorists.""
But with Mrs. Clinton zeroing in on the Democratic nomination after several big primary wins over Mr. Sanders, she sounded more hard-line on Tuesday. ""I give quarter to nobody in being as focused as I can be,"" she said on CNN.
Speaking in Everett, Wash., Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton took aim at Mr. Trump, alluding to the role of the Internet in terrorist recruitment. ""Some of my opponents want to build walls and shut the world off,"" she said. ""Well, you tell me, how high does the wall have to be to keep the Internet out?""
She also sought to contrast her attitude toward American Muslims with that of the Republicans, saying Muslims could alert authorities to suspicious doings.

An Empty Obama-Clinton-Sanders Plan on Drug Costs,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774716788?accountid=12768,"President Obama's latest budget includes proposals -- echoed or one-upped on the presidential-campaign trail by Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton -- that would require pharmaceutical companies to release data on the cost of research and development (R&D) and the extent of discounts offered to insurers for each drug brought to market. Yet the key numbers already are disclosed freely -- and we know how to get better value from medicines and improve their affordability to patients.
The company I lead, Lilly, discloses its annual R&D spending in audited financial statements every year, like other public companies. Lilly's number for 2015 was $4.8 billion -- part of the $50 billion invested in R&D each year by the members of our industry association alone. That's more than 20% of all R&D spending by all U.S. businesses. Seen against that staggering total, the proposal to mandate the nearly impossible task of assembling drug-by-drug R&D-spending figures misses the whole point.
Pharmaceutical companies' R&D feeds innovation from the earliest identification of leads through to clinical trials, real-world data collection and the refinement of existing treatments. It includes the cost of myriad failures -- part of every scientific enterprise -- along with further research on approved medicines, right up to their patent expirations. Money made on the sale of today's new medicines feeds all of the indispensable streams in this complex ecosystem.
Averages are easy enough to come by -- a new academic study in the Journal of Health Economics says it takes about $2.6 billion in R&D investment per new medicine launched. Calculating a precise number for an individual product is quite another matter. Consider Lilly's investment of billions of dollars in R&D related to Alzheimer's disease over the last quarter century. Since there are several candidates in our pipeline that emerged from past work, to which future product and in what proportion should these costs be allocated? And to what end?
The key insight is beyond dispute. Developing medicines is risky, expensive and time-consuming, and everyone would be better off if it were less so. Rather than meaningless disclosure mandates, policy efforts instead should encourage whatever can be done, without compromising patient safety, to shave precious weeks off development and regulatory-approval timelines.
There are effective ways to do that. For example, pooling access to potential new molecules and sharing ""pre-competitive"" research on promising treatment paths could avoid costly duplication. Industry and the FDA could ramp up the use of ""adaptive clinical trials"" that refocus themselves based on real-time findings rather than starting over. And large-scale efforts to capture the real-world outcomes of treatments in genetically profiled patients -- and feed these insights back to R&D labs -- would accelerate progress significantly.
Mandating further disclosure of discounts negotiated by drug companies also is a route to nowhere. Lest anyone doubt that the discounts are substantial, allow me to report freely that the average net prices paid last year by Lilly's customers in the U.S. ranged from a high of 67% of list prices paid by commercial health plans to a low of 19% paid by government purchasers including Medicaid. That's right: The average discount off list price was more than 80% for government payers.
I'm not cherry-picking these figures -- they cover Lilly's entire portfolio of established products. But forcing Lilly, or other companies, to disclose product-by-product and payer-by-payer discounts would be an unprecedented affront to free-market competition.
The list prices of medicines that feed media sensationalism are paid by essentially no institutional or government buyer in a hotly competitive marketplace. Yet affordability remains a problem for many patients. That's because insured patients in the U.S. today pay an average of about 20% of their prescription-drug costs out-of-pocket compared with about 5% of their hospital costs. Some patients' cost shares are much worse -- due to complex insurance ""tier"" systems for drugs and the rise of ""combined deductibles,"" in which drug expenses get lumped together with major-medical costs, and benefits hinge on reaching a high expense threshold.
The insurance bias against medicines needs to be addressed head-on, at the very least so that patients benefit from the savings negotiated by their insurers. Clearing the Food and Drug Administration's huge backlog of generic-drug applications would also be a great help.
Lilly and Anthem, a major insurer, recently asked for changes in federal regulations that make it difficult to set up ""outcomes-based contracts."" These would link payment for a drug to the presentation of evidence that patients achieved the health benefits expected from the drug, for example.
The realities that determine the cost of medicines to patients don't require mandated disclosures. They are as plain as day. They simply need to be acknowledged and acted upon rather than distorted and ignored.

Clinton's Star Email Witness,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771794150?accountid=12768,"The Justice Department is widely reported to have offered criminal immunity to Bryan Pagliano, the techie who set up Hillary Clinton's private email operation. Now that he has that get-out-of-jeopardy-free card, Mr. Pagliano also ought to be able to tell Congress and the public what he knows.
Last year Mr. Pagliano exercised his Fifth Amendment right not to testify about his role in maintaining a private email system for Mrs. Clinton when she was Secretary of State. But as GOP Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley wrote in a letter to him last week, ""there is no longer reasonable cause for you to believe that discussing these matters with the relevant oversight committees could result in your prosecution."" They want Mr. Pagliano to appear before the Homeland Security and Judiciary committees. (Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday refused to say if Justice had offered Mr. Pagliano immunity, but that's her standard operating procedure.)
Mr. Pagliano, who worked on Mrs. Clinton's 2008 campaign and then moved with her to State, could be a star witness. He presumably knows Mrs. Clinton's motive for the system; who at the State Department knew about and approved it; what security measures were in place; whether there were security breaches; and whether he was paid by Bill and Hillary in addition to his State salary.
Given his political ties to the Clintons, he may also know who outside the government also used her server -- in particular whether it was a clearinghouse for State Department and Clinton Foundation business. Mr. Pagliano also has emails from his own pagliano.com address that he has so far refused to turn over and that the Senators want to see.
Messrs. Johnson and Grassley point out that Congress has a unique interest in this testimony. The FBI is presumably not investigating whether Mrs. Clinton or her aides deliberately attempted to evade federal record-keeping or freedom-of-information laws because those statutes don't include criminal enforcement. Yet the country has a right to know if its top officials engaged in an organized effort to evade disclosure laws. Congress has an interest in that kind of oversight.
As a Clinton loyalist, Mr. Pagliano will no doubt resist appearing before Congress, but the Senators have the option of a subpoena. The public deserves to know the kind of government Mrs. Clinton would deliver if she becomes our next President.",2016-04-27
Election 2016: Clinton Faces Test in Wooing Sanders Fans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771109327?accountid=12768,"LINCOLN, Neb. -- It is rare for the crowd to boo at a Bernie Sanders rally. When it happens, it is usually at the point he invokes the name of his opponent in the Democratic presidential race, Hillary Clinton.
With Mrs. Clinton holding a substantial lead in the race for convention delegates, many Sanders loyalists are grappling with an uncomfortable question: If he loses, would they back her?
Interviews with a number of Sanders supporters present an unclear picture. Some say they wouldn't vote for the former senator and secretary of state if she wins the party nomination. Others say they would, reluctantly. Still others see strengths in Mrs. Clinton and would unconditionally back her for the White House.
The Democratic primary fight has been nowhere near as divisive as the Republican one. Still, in a campaign stop Monday in Grand Rapids, Mich., Mrs. Clinton made clear she is aware of what might lie ahead as she talked about the hard-fought 2008 race against Barack Obama and her work in helping the nominee pull in her supporters once he wrapped up the nomination that June.
That effort wasn't entirely successful -- one pro-Clinton group held out and defiantly campaigned for Republican nominee John McCain.
""I had a lot of passionate supporters who did not feel like they wanted to support then-Sen. Obama. I worked as hard as I could. I nominated him at the convention. I made the case, because he and I shared a lot of the same views,"" she said. ""I would hope to be able to enlist Bernie in helping me reach out to his supporters if I am so fortunate to be the nominee.""
Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, has given every indication he would endorse Mrs. Clinton if she wins the nomination. He says he likes and respects her and has set limits on how negative he is willing to go.
But it isn't clear how many of his die-hard supporters would fall in line. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed half the Sanders supporters have a positive view of Mrs. Clinton, but 31% have a negative one. About four in 10 Sanders supporters say they worry about Mrs. Clinton's ""ties to Wall Street and millions in speaking fees.""
At a speech in Lincoln last week, Mr. Sanders elicited boos when he mentioned Wall Street donations collected by a pro-Clinton super PAC.
Kathleen Worcester, a 42-year-old who came to hear Mr. Sanders at a rally last week in Portland, Maine, said she is unsure of what she would do if her candidate doesn't win. Mrs. Clinton ""seems like a moderate conservative to me,"" she said.
Clinton aides say she has long been mindful that, as a nominee, she would need the support of Sanders backers, many of whom see her as the embodiment of the establishment politics they hope the senator would vanquish.
At times, she has been sharply critical of Mr. Sanders -- the two candidates interrupted and talked over each other at a testy debate Sunday night in Flint, Mich. -- but she has also tried to direct her barbs at Republicans in hopes of unifying Democrats behind a common enemy.
""We have differences, but those differences pale in comparison to what we see going on with the Republicans right now,"" she said in Grand Rapids.
And she has offered overt outreach, particularly to the young voters who overwhelmingly favor Mr. Sanders.
For now, Mr. Sanders is doing nothing to endear the front-runner to his supporters. ""There are many people, including my opponent, who want you to think kind of small,"" he said at a recent campaign stop.
Marcus Johnson, 24, one of about 10,000 people who came to hear Mr. Sanders speak at Michigan State University last week, said he would never vote for Mrs. Clinton and would consider backing the Green Party candidate.
""Honestly, I think she's a Republican,"" he said.
Others are open to supporting her, though some say unenthusiastically.
""It would be a definite vote against the GOP and not for Hillary,"" said Harriet Scureman, 71, of Norwalk, Conn.
On the other hand, Katherine Steinfield, 22, a senior at Michigan State who prefers Mr. Sanders, said Mrs. Clinton, as a woman, has had to overcome obstacles that Mr. Sanders never faced. ""I think she's impressive, too,"" she said.

Election 2016: Clinton and Sanders Clash --- Sparks fly over auto bailout and trade at seventh Democratic presidential debate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770825947?accountid=12768,"FLINT, Mich. -- The Democratic presidential contenders clashed over economic policy in a debate Sunday, with front-runner Hillary Clinton attacking rival Bernie Sanders for his opposition to a federal auto bailout and Mr. Sanders charging that Clinton-backed trade deals had helped destroy American cities like Detroit.
Both issues resonate deeply in Michigan, which holds a primary election Tuesday. The state is home to auto makers that benefited from a 2009 government bailout, but it also has lost jobs to trade as companies moved positions overseas.
It was their seventh debate, and the sharpest clash yet, with the candidates repeatedly interrupting and accusing each other of hypocrisy. Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates, even after weekend caucus wins for Mr. Sanders in Nebraska, Kansas and Maine. Mrs. Clinton won Saturday's Louisiana primary, which had the biggest delegate count.
Asked about a possible future confrontation with Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Mrs. Clinton predicted that his ""bigotry, his bullying, his bluster are not going to wear well on the American people.""
The Vermont senator stayed on offense. He blasted Mrs. Clinton's record, demanded she release transcripts of her Wall Street speeches and sharply critiqued her husband's record as president in the 1990s.
Mr. Sanders has been attacking Mrs. Clinton over trade, but Mrs. Clinton's hit on the auto bailout was a new and potent counter. Federal assistance for the industry was included in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion measure that was credited with keeping the nation's financial system from collapsing. The Senate vote to release the second half of those funds came in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration.
""The money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry,"" said Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator. ""I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money.""
Mr. Sanders defended his vote, saying he objected to the Wall Street bailout money. He said he wasn't willing to give taxpayer money to those companies due to what he called their own recklessness, greed and illegal behavior. ""Let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street,"" he said. ""I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street.""
Within minutes, the Sanders campaign sought to soften and clarify his position. Mr. Sanders supported the auto funds but not the Wall Street rescue, it said. Since they couldn't be separated, he opposed the bill.
Mrs. Clinton said the exchange proved her point that Mr. Sanders is a ""one-issue candidate."" Mr. Sanders didn't disagree, but said his ""one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class.""
Mr. Sanders attacked Mrs. Clinton's support for some free-trade agreements, such as Nafta, which eased trade rules with Mexico and other nations and was signed by former President Bill Clinton and backed by Mrs. Clinton when she was first lady. ""You didn't need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour,"" he said. He also criticized welfare reform and Wall Street deregulation legislation that he signed.
In each case, Mrs. Clinton replied that ""if we're going to argue about the 1990s,"" then she preferred to talk about that era's robust job creation and broadly rising incomes.
Mrs. Clinton went after Mr. Sanders for opposing reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which provides financial support to help U.S. companies export their goods. Mr. Sanders called the entire enterprise ""corporate welfare.""
The debate was staged in Flint, a venue pushed by Mrs. Clinton to bring attention to a crisis that was triggered by a cost-cutting move that elevated the lead level in the city's water supply.
Mr. Sanders repeated his call for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to resign, and for the first time, Mrs. Clinton agreed and added that if he doesn't resign, he should be recalled.
In a series of tweets sent during the debate, Mr. Snyder defended his record and said he is taking responsibility for the Flint crisis.
The pair also returned to one of their longtime disputes -- Mr. Sanders's backing of a 2005 law that provided gun makers legal immunity. In January, Mr. Sanders voiced support for legislation that would remove gun manufacturers' protections from liability. On Sunday, though, Mr. Sanders offered a more nuanced view, suggesting gun makers shouldn't be held responsible for actions of those who legally purchase firearms.

Election 2016: Poll: Clinton Has Lead In Michigan,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770825895?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is leading Sen. Bernie Sanders by a wide margin ahead of Tuesday's Michigan primary, and she would beat the two GOP front-runners in potential general-election matchups, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll showed.
In the contest for the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is polling at 57% in Michigan, compared with 40% for the Vermont senator, the survey found.
Donald Trump is the preferred pick of 41% of likely GOP primary voters, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 22%. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio draws 17% support. John Kasich, the governor of neighboring Ohio, is last at 13%.
The results suggest that a significant challenge remains for GOP leaders who are trying to slow Mr. Trump's momentum after his dominant performance on SuperTuesday,on which he won seven states and opened up a big lead in delegates.On Thursday, Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee and a Michigan native, delivered a full-throated takedown of the Republican front-runner.
But the survey bolsters at least one argument Republicans are making against the New York billionaire: He trails Mrs. Clinton by 16 percentage points in one of the states he predicts he could win in the fall, and he trails Mr. Sanders by 22 points. Mr. Romney lost Michigan -- 44% to 54% -- to President Barack Obama in 2012.
""The GOP's worries about the Trump candidacy seem well-founded in the contest for Michigan's 16 electoral votes,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. ""Trump trails both Clinton and Sanders by substantially wider margins than Romney lost the state to Obama in 2012.""
The decision by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to exit from the presidential race has had little impact on the field in his home state of Michigan, the poll finds. Conducted before Mr. Carson announced that he was leaving the campaign trail, the poll found him to be the top pick of 9% of likely GOP primary voters. When his support was distributed to voters' second-choice candidates, it was spread almost evenly among the rest of the field. All four candidates gained modest ground, and Mr. Trump's lead over Mr. Cruz shrank by 2 percentage points.
Mr. Trump's support in Michigan reflects his strengths in the 19 states that have already voted. He performs best among men, Republican primary voters who identify themselves as moderate, those who lack a college degree and voters who make less than $50,000 a year. He registers his highest support from GOP voters who don't actively practice a religion.
Mr. Cruz leads Mr. Trump among a single group -- the 16% of likely GOP primary voters who describe themselves as ""very conservative.""
In the Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton holds large leads among African-Americans, drawing 76% to his 21%. Similar leads propelled Mrs. Clinton to victories in South Carolina, Georgia and other states with large shares of African-American voters. The two more or less split white Democratic primary voters in Michigan.
""Michigan is following a familiar story line,"" Mr. Miringoff said. ""The greater the diversity of the Democratic electorate, the greater the Clinton lead.""
The former secretary of state also crushes Mr. Sanders among registered Democrats, garnering almost twice as much support. He shows similar strength among independents, but they account for only 22% of likely Democratic primary voters, according to the poll.

Election 2016: Clinton Assails Business -- Selectively,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770472596?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton sees the naughty and the nice in corporate America as she tries to channel populist anger without alienating too many businesses.
The Democratic presidential front-runner routinely condemns what she sees as corporate malfeasance, but she says other companies are job generators and good corporate citizens. She has rolled out tax proposals aimed at rewarding business practices she favors and punishments for what she sees as shortsighted and even unpatriotic moves.
In an address Friday in Detroit, Mrs. Clinton touted a resurgent auto industry and technological breakthroughs by Michigan manufacturers. But she also singled out Nabisco for laying people off in Chicago and moving production to Mexico.
""I'm not interested in condemning whole categories of business, or the entire private sector, of course not. But I do want to send a clear message to every boardroom and executive suite: If you cheat your employees, exploit consumers, you pollute our environment or rip off the taxpayers, we will hold you accountable,"" she said. ""But do the right thing, invest in your workers and your country's future, and we will stand with you.""
It is Mrs. Clinton's way of responding to her Democratic rival for the presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders, who issues sweeping, strongly worded condemnations of corporate America. A favorite line: ""Corporate greed is destroying our economy.""
Nabisco is only Mrs. Clinton's most recent target. Her campaign has aired at least two television ads directed at individual companies. In a spot that began airing Tuesday, she promised to go after Valeant Pharmaceuticals International for its ""predatory pricing"" after the company dramatically raised the price of a migraine treatment. A company spokeswoman replied that most people use the generic version.
In another ad last month, Mrs. Clinton stood in front of Johnson Controls Inc. in Milwaukee and criticized the company for a planned merger that would reduce its tax bill. ""They're gaming the system and moving profits to Ireland so they can avoid paying taxes here at home,"" she said.
The company said its merger was meant to ""drive innovation"" and was part of a broader plan to grow in the U.S. and globally.
Mrs. Clinton also has singled out Turing Pharmaceuticals, which increased the price of a lifesaving drug. Her approach has something in common with Republican Donald Trump, who has criticized Ford Motor Co. and a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp., as well as Mondelez International Inc., Nabisco's parent company, for moving U.S. production facilities to Mexico.
On Friday, Mrs. Clinton slammed Nabisco for benefiting from tax breaks from the state of Illinois and then abandoning U.S. workers. She was referring to the situation in Chicago, where the company announced it was laying off 600 workers from its bakery and moving some production lines to Mexico.
""They have no problem taking taxpayer dollars with one hand and giving out pink slips with the other,"" she said. ""If a company like Nabisco outsources and ships jobs overseas, we'll make you give back the tax breaks you receive here in America.""
Mondelez spokeswoman Laurie Guzzinati replied that the company was planning to replace nine older production lines with four new ones, which would have reduced its workforce by about 300 people, anyway. She said the company decided to expand its facility in Salinas, Mexico, after concluding it could save $46 million a year.

"Election 2016: Sanders, Clinton Spar on Trade in Midwest --- Senator attacks Nafta and Pacific deal, and front-runner promises job-creation policies",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175569?accountid=12768,"EAST LANSING, Mich. -- Trade and manufacturing took center stage as the Democratic presidential race moved to Michigan on Thursday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders talking up his longtime opposition to free trade agreements and Hillary Clinton's campaign promising policies that would support job creation.
Mr. Sanders, looking for a win in the industrial heartland, repeated his claim that Mrs. Clinton had supported ""disastrous"" trade agreements and suggested that her opposition to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership wasn't sincere.
The former secretary of state plans to respond in a speech at an auto supplier in Detroiton Friday. Advisers said that Mrs. Clinton would propose ways to create jobs by boosting manufacturing, and that she was willing to back trade agreements only if they met her standards.
""The answer can't be to shut down all trade,"" said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton's senior policy adviser. He said the key is backing ""smart and fair trade, where American workers get a level playing field with the rest of the world.""
The candidates have been debating these points for months, but the issues are taking on new urgency with the approach of Tuesday's primary in Michigan, a state long reliant on manufacturing that has suffered steep job losses.
The issue is sure to be litigated when Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton debate on Sunday in Flint, Mich.
Mr. Sanders is banking on a win in Michigan for fresh momentum after losing seven of the 11 states that voted on Tuesday and falling well behind in the delegate count. His top aides refer to the Michigan contest as a ""showdown"" that will influence the course of the race.
On Thursday, Mr. Sanders fired the first salvo. At a news conference here, surrounded by union workers, he said he had consistently opposed trade deals and suggested that Mrs. Clinton can't be trusted to stop them if elected president.
Mr. Sanders said that trade agreements such as Nafta, signed by Mrs. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, have eliminated jobs in the U.S. as corporations have moved operations to countries that pay lower wages.
He rattled off various trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton backed and that he had opposed. ""On the issue of trade, Secretary Clinton's views and mine are very different,"" Mr. Sanders said.
He also pointed to Mrs. Clinton's original kind words for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation deal that is one of the Obama administration's key priorities. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton called it the ""gold standard,"" but she came out against it once it was completed in October, six months into her presidential campaign.
""She was very reluctant to come out in opposition,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""She is running for president. She concluded it was a good idea to oppose the TPP, and she did.""
The Sanders campaign also is airing a TV ad in Michigan that says Mr. Sanders has been steadfast in opposing trade deals ""while others waffle.""
Mrs. Clinton has said she evaluates trade agreements on a case-by-case basis, supporting some but not others. As a senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton opposed a Central American Free Trade Agreement but supported deals with Australia, Singapore and several other nations.
Mr. Sullivan didn't answer directly when asked whether, if elected president, Mrs. Clinton would try to make changes to the Asian deal to get it approved. He said that she believes ""we need to have a very serious conversation about the future of trade."" He said that should include how to prevent a ""race to the bottom"" among trading partners, and that Mrs. Clinton wants a ""hard think"" about what it would take to construct trade agreements that raise working standards.
Clinton aides said that in her Friday speech, she would present a broad vision for bolstering U.S. jobs. Mr. Sullivan said she would lay out a ""new bargain for a new economy"" that extends to coal country and cities such as Detroit.
She has already laid out several small-scale proposals for bolstering manufacturing, including tax breaks to encourage investment in hard-hit areas and better enforcement of trade agreements.
Mr. Sullivan charged that Mr. Sanders didn't have a manufacturing plan of his own, and said he was wrong to oppose reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which provides financing to support some major domestic manufacturers. On that issue, Mr. Sanders aligned with conservatives in opposing what he called ""corporate welfare to multinational corporations.""
The Clinton campaign also called in backing from Michigan's Sen. Debbie Stabenow. The senator said that Mrs. Clinton ""totally gets it"" when it comes to manufacturing and jobs. ""You don't have an economy, you don't have a middle class, unless somebody makes something,"" she said.

Election 2016: Front-Runner Keys on Black Vote --- Clinton looks to one of her main voting blocs as she seeks to close out Democratic race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776773735?accountid=12768,"MILWAUKEE -- Looking to close out the contest against rival Bernie Sanders, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton is stepping up her outreach to the voters who vaulted her to a dominant position in the race for delegates: African-Americans.
Coming off a trio of lopsided losses last weekend in the West, Mrs. Clinton still enjoys a commanding delegate lead, though the path to the nomination figures to be bumpy. Her advisers concede she will have a tough time in the next big primary, in Wisconsin on April 5,and Mr. Sanders is going all-in for the New York contest two weeks later, hoping for an upset in Mrs. Clinton's home state.
With no sign the Vermont senator will step aside, Mrs. Clinton is signaling she will lean heavily on black voters to capture the delegates needed for the nomination.
She has sought to showcase her ties to African-Americans over the past few days in Wisconsin. Accompanied by local African-American congresswoman Gwen Moore, she led a forum on gun violence Tuesday at a Baptist church in a Milwaukee neighborhood that is more than 90% black.
A panel at the event gave graphic accounts of sons and daughters killed by guns. Sitting by Mrs. Clinton was Annette Nance-Holt, whose high-school son Blair Holt was shot dead on a Chicago bus in 2007.
""I applaud Secretary Clinton for reaching out to us, because that other candidate on the Democratic side did not reach out to us,"" Ms. Nance-Holt said.
Still, Barry Burden,a political-science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the state has too few African-American voters to put Mrs. Clinton over the top.
""Her strength is in the African-American community, but it's smaller in Wisconsin than in the other Midwestern states,"" he said.
African-Americans make up 6.6% of the Wisconsin population, according to Census data.
Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, said a number of factors in Wisconsin, including the state's open primary, which makes it easier for independents to have a say, and its progressive bent, put Mr. Sanders in a good position. But even if the senator ""edges out a victory"" in Wisconsin, that isn't likely to significantly erode Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead, he said. ""Regardless of the outcome in Wisconsin, we expect to compete strongly in the state,"" Mr. Fallon said.
Delegates are awarded proportionally in Democratic primaries and caucuses.
On Wednesday in New York, where 247 delegates are up for grabs, Mrs. Clinton campaignedat the Apollo Theater in Manhattan, an iconic venue for black performers.
Perhaps more than any other voting group, African-Americans have defined the Democratic race. Mrs. Clinton racked up large delegate leads on March 1 with landslide wins in Georgia, Alabama and other Southern states where blacks account for a hefty share of the Democratic electorate.
In a recent conference call with reporters, Sanders advisers said they chose not to compete in these states, realizing Mrs. Clinton had advantages the senator couldn't overcome. Instead, the campaign looked farther North and West, hoping their victories in Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota would prove the senator could go toe-to-toe with the former Secretary of State.
Some Democratic strategists say this was a mistake.
""It is too late for them to figure out a strategy to garner support from the African-American community,"" said Tharon Johnson, who served as the southern regional director for President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign.
Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said Mrs. Clinton has assembled a coalition that resembles then-Sen. Barack Obama's support base in 2008.
""If she can maintain her strong support with communities of color, she will get to the finish line with the most pledged delegates,"" he said.
Sanders campaign aides said the senator has made progress with African-Americans, pointing to his upset win in Michigan, where he won 30% of the black vote.
Tad Devine, a senior strategist for the Sanders campaign, said on the conference call that the candidate was largely unknown in the African-American community when the race began. But Mr. Sanders's history of civil-rights activism and his policy agenda should resonate with black voters as they get to know him, he said.
""We have worked very hard and will continue to work hard all the way through to the end in trying to make sure that African-American voters first of all know his story,"" he said.
But is it too late?
Four states -- New York, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania -- account for about 60% of the 1,747 remaining delegates. All are racially diverse states that Mrs. Clinton won in her 2008 bid.
Clinton strategist Joel Benenson said recently Mr. Sanders is running out of ""real estate"" to erase her lead.

Election 2016: Clinton Ad In New York Takes Aim At Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776773370?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton on Wednesday released her first TV ad aimed at New York voters ahead of the state's primary on April 19, and it has one target: Donald Trump.
Mrs. Clinton's rival for the Democratic nomination remains Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but with a large delegate lead in the Democratic presidential race, she increasingly has been shifting her focus to her potential opponent in the general election.
The 30-second spot, narrated by Mrs. Clinton, doesn't mention Mr. Trump by name. But it is filled with references to his candidacy and brand.
The ad invokes some of the themes from Mr. Trump's campaign, notably his call for building a wall on America's southern border and his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the U.S. Mrs. Clinton says, ""When some say we can solve America's problems by building walls, banning people based on their religion and turning against each other. . . Well, this is New York. And we know better.""
With 247 delegates at stake, New York is the biggest prize left in the Democratic primary race except for California, whose primary is set for June 7. Mrs. Clinton represented the state in the Senate for eight years before signing on as President Barack Obama's secretary of state in 2009.
Earlier this year, Mr. Trump said in an interview with the Hill that he would ""expand the map"" in a general election and that he would have a ""real good shot"" at winning New York, a state that typically favors Democratic presidential candidates. ""This is my place,"" the New York businessman said. ""I love New York.""

U.S. News: Plaintiffs In Clinton Case Get New Boost,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776594312?accountid=12768,"A second federal judge Tuesday granted a conservative group the right to gather evidence in connection with its effort to access some of Hillary Clinton's records from her time at the State Department.
Judge Royce Lamberth of the federal District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the group, Judicial Watch, was entitled to discovery in its lawsuit seeking access to information about the State Department's handling of the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Mrs. Clinton, now the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of state at the time.
The judge wrote Tuesday that the government's ""constantly shifting admissions"" about its search for records that Judicial Watch requested gave him reason to grant discovery.
""Whether the State Department's actions will ultimately be determined by the Court to not be 'acting in good faith' remains to be seen at this time,"" Judge Lamberth wrote, ""but plaintiff is clearly entitled to discovery and a record before this Court rules on that issue.""
In a suit filed in July 2014, Judicial Watch seeks records from Mrs. Clinton and her staff regarding the Benghazi attacks and other records of Susan Rice, who was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations at the time of the attack and is now President Barack Obama's national security adviser. The group didn't name Mrs. Clinton in the suit.
A State Department official said the department is reviewing Judge Lamberth's discovery order and declined to comment further on the case. Representatives for Mrs. Clinton didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Judge Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee who has a long history of handling cases involving the Clinton administration, noted in his order that it is ""exceedingly rare"" to grant limited discovery in Freedom of Information Act cases. But he is already the second federal judge to do so in cases involving Mrs. Clinton's emails.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, a Bill Clinton appointee, in February granted Judicial Watch's request forlimited discovery in a separate lawsuit against the State Department over Mrs. Clinton's email practices while she was secretary of state.
In its discovery request in that case, also filed in the District of Columbia federal court, Judicial Watch seeks to question eight current and former State Department officials.
Judge Sullivan is expected to rule on Judicial Watch's plan in that case afterApril 15. After Judge Sullivan's discovery order is issued, Judicial Watch will have 10 days to file a discovery plan tailored to the Susan Rice suit, Judge Lamberth ruled on Tuesday.

Election 2016: Clinton Digs In as Trump Moves On,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776257418?accountid=12768,"Jessica Flannery spent the first half of March in Democrat Hillary Clinton's Des Moines campaign office with three dozen other volunteers, calling the front-runner's supporters in Iowa to ensure they showed up at county conventions and were elected delegates to the national party gathering in July.
Republican front-runner Donald Trump's campaign, meanwhile, sent an email to local Republicans just before the statewide county convention inviting them to sign up to be a delegate for him. The campaign followed up a few days later with an apology, telling email recipients they weren't eligible to be delegates unless they'd already enrolled as one at local precincts.
""It did not evidence a robust organization,"" said Matt Strawn, a former Iowa GOP chairman who received one of the emails. Mr. Trump also has stopped paying his top two Iowa operatives, whose contracts expired last month -- weeks after the state's first-in-the-nation caucuses were held.
As Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump aim to clinch their parties' nominations, the former secretary of state is poised to start the general-election campaign with a far more sophisticated operation in key swing states than the businessman.
""It unequivocally is helpful for a campaign that spent a year-plus working in Iowa to keep some people in play,"" said David Oman, a former Iowa state GOP co-chairman and senior political adviser to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who quit the race last month. ""It would be a mistake to let people go. . .and then have to put the team back together again to marshal a general-election campaign.""
Mr. Trump has largely eschewed implementing a traditional ground game, instead relying on large rallies and his star power to turn out voters. As a consequence, strategists in Iowa and New Hampshire say there's little left of his already-sparse operations in the states.
Mr. Trump's Iowa state director, Chuck Laudner, is no longer working for the campaign, the longtime Iowa operative confirmed. He was paid $21,000 at the end of February, down from nearly $35,000 for the month before the Iowa caucuses.
Deputy state director Ryan Keller also said his contract with the campaign had ended, and said he hadn't ""put that much thought"" into whether he would rejoin for the general election. The campaign's primary remaining operative in the state is Tana Goertz, a former contestant on Mr. Trump's reality TV show, ""The Apprentice.""
The Trump campaign didn't return a request for comment.
After Mr. Trump placed second in Iowa, he criticized his own campaign's operations there. ""I think we could have used a better ground game, a term I wasn't even familiar with,"" he told MSNBC in the days after the Iowa caucuses. ""I would've funded a better ground game, but people told me my ground game was fine.""
In New Hampshire, where Mr. Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski previously served as state director for a pro-free market group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, Mr. Trump ran a similarly thin operation. ""Mr. Trump never really had any infrastructure to begin with,"" said Jamie Burnett, a Republican strategist who worked on Mitt Romney's 2008 campaign. ""When he left town, they packed up the three-ring circus and they sent the public-relations campaign to another state.""
Mr. Burnett, who supported Mr. Bush before he left the GOP race, said that if Mr. Trump becomes the nominee, he will be ""starting from scratch"" in New Hampshire. ""They're going to have to hope that a big, large-scale PR campaign can beat someone like Clinton, and I just don't think it can,"" he said.
Mr. Trump's unorthodox operation has proven to be mostly successful. He has won the majority of states and has a lead of nearly 300 delegates over Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Yet GOP strategists say a general-election terrain -- in which he would face a single opponent -- could offer a tougher test of his campaign strategy.
Mrs. Clinton's operation, which had 26 offices in Iowa in the lead-up to the state's Feb. 1 caucuses, has left one open, where Ms. Flannery, an organizing director for Naral Pro-Choice, manned six phone banks this month.
Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said this month that building a volunteer base in primary states is an ""investment for the general election."" She pointed to the importance of the databases in states that are battlegrounds in the general election. ""Those are useful audiences that you want to reach repeatedly,"" she said.

Biden-Clinton Friction Hangs Over Campaign,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776145303?accountid=12768,"Democrats worried about Hillary Clinton's electoral weaknesses see Vice President Joe Biden as a potential solution -- as long as the two former cabinet colleagues and sometime rivals can smooth their complicated relationship.
Mrs. Clinton's vulnerabilities were apparent over the weekend when she suffered lopsided losses to rival Sen. Bernie Sanders in Democratic caucuses in Washington, Hawaii and Alaska. The trio of states contain either many white voters or veer to the left wing of the Democratic Party, two constituencies where Mrs. Clinton has struggled.
Mr. Biden, who often talks about his upbringing in Scranton, Pa., in a family that endured financial hardships, has shown an affinity with working-class whites that could help overcome doubts about Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. He appears willing to hit the trail for the potential Democratic ticket.
Looming over the possible collaboration, however, are tensions between two of the nation's most important Democrats: a sitting vice president and a former secretary of state who might wind up with the job he has long coveted.
In one notable instance, Mr. Biden said in a January television interview that Mrs. Clinton was ""relatively new"" to the issue of income inequality and that no one doubted Mr. Sanders's ""authenticity"" on that issue.
Within minutes, according to people on both sides familiar with the matter, an aide to Mr. Biden got a phone call from Clinton campaign senior adviser Jennifer Palmieri insisting he was ""wrong"" in his characterization. She asked if he had more interviews scheduled and what else he planned to say. The next day, Mr. Biden went on TV and softened his comments.
Cooperating with Team Clinton would require Mr. Biden set aside bruised feelings stemming from his own presidential flirtations. He chose to sit out the race, though he says he has recurring regrets about being on the sidelines.
What is clear is that Mrs. Clinton needs someone to help win over white men. She lost this group to Mr. Sanders by 25 percentage points in Michigan, by 15 points in Ohio and 22 points in North Carolina, exit polls show.
Should she find herself in a general election showdown with Republican Donald Trump, she faces stiff competition for that demographic. In his primary victory in Michigan, for example, Mr. Trump won 45% of male voters, more than Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz combined.
Earlier this month, Mrs. Clinton played into perceptions among working class white men that she is tone deaf to their struggles when she said at a televised town hall event that under her presidency, coal miners would find themselves ""out of business.""
Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said the remark could jeopardize her chances to win his state. He phoned Mrs. Clinton to complain and asked if she was simply writing off West Virginia, a state no Democrat has won since her husband did in 1996. She quickly sent a letter apologizing and saying she had been ""mistaken.""
""If anybody can help smooth it over it could be Joe,"" Mr. Manchin said in an interview.
An aide to Mr. Biden said, ""He will be heavily involved in helping the Democratic nominee and stands willing to assist in states where he's helpful.""
Over the past quarter of a century Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton have been peers, colleagues and rivals. Their relationship has been cordial, but they aren't especially close, people who know them both say. In private conversations with friends and political figures, Mr. Biden has voiced concerns about what he sees as the Clintons trying to capitalize on their public service, by giving paid speeches, for example.
Mrs. Clinton has said repeatedly she isn't compromised by virtue of taking speaking fees from interest groups. ""Anybody who thinks they can buy me doesn't know me,"" she told the Des Moines Register early this year.
Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton served together in the Senate and then faced each other in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. One person close to Mrs. Clinton's previous campaign said she came to respect Mr. Biden's debating skills but didn't see him as a threat. Mr. Biden dropped out of the race after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses.
After President Barack Obama took office, Mrs. Clinton was named secretary of state. As vice president Mr. Biden also had pieces of the foreign-policy portfolio.
She tended to be more hawkish and inclined to use force, while Mr. Biden was more skeptical of military intervention, those who worked with them say.
""In general, the vice president was more wary about the use of the military and more cautious in that sense,"" said Leon Panetta, a former defense secretary in the Obama administration. ""And [Mrs. Clinton] was more willing to take a stronger stance.""
Mr. Biden wasn't happy about Mrs. Clinton's push for an American air campaign in Libya in 2011, undertaken with Western allies, which led to the death of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. He worried about a power vacuum in the wake of Gadhafi's fall, a former adviser said. Libya now has become fractured and destabilized, and Islamic State has spread inside the country.
In an interview on MSNBC earlier this month, Mrs. Clinton said it isn't easy for nations to make the transition from dictatorship to democracy. As for taking military actions in Libya, she said the U.S. couldn't simply turn its back on Arab allies that had asked for help in combating Gadhafi.
A sticky moment in dealings between Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton came last year, when he weighed a possible presidential bid. As Mr. Biden spent months deliberating, Mrs. Clinton said she was willing to give him space and time.
Yet Mr. Biden was angered by what he believed to be quiet efforts by her allies to try to dissuade him from running, blaming them for news reports highlighting past positions that might hurt him. In particular, he believed Clinton allies suggested he was cool to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, people close to him say.
Mr. Biden is poised to be a high-profile surrogate if Mrs. Clinton captures the nomination. Friends hope if she wins the presidency she will tap Mr. Biden for special projects, perhaps as an informal roving ambassador.
Mrs. Clinton has hinted she has something in mind for Mr. Biden, saying, ""History isn't finished with Joe Biden"" after he announced he wouldn't run.
One friend, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, said he has told Mr. Biden, ""You'll need to do everything you can to get her elected, and if she wins she will want you to be ambassador to the world.""

Election 2016: Clinton Eyes Win In North Carolina,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773136920?accountid=12768,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- Hillary Clinton's Southern firewall of support looks likely to hold in North Carolina Tuesday, where a victory would highlight rival Bernie Sanders's struggle to make inroads in states where African-American voters make up a significant bloc of the Democratic electorate.
Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders scheduled campaign stops in vote-rich Charlotte on Monday. But many Democrats in the state said the last-minute rallies were unlikely to make much difference.
""If Sen. Sanders had spent some more time here, we'd probably see a tighter race than what it is,"" said Jeremy Wayne Teetor, an adviser to Elon University's College Democrats.
Mr. Teetor, who is voting for Mr. Sanders, said the Vermont senator was strategically spending his time elsewhere, hoping to score an upset in one of the four other states votingTuesday, such as Illinois. ""You've got to protect your resources,"" he said.
For months, Mrs. Clinton has maintained a steady lead in North Carolina polls, including one released Monday by Democratic firm Public Policy Polling of Raleigh. Mrs. Clinton was leading Mr. Sanders 56% to 37% in North Carolina and 57% to 32% in Florida. But the firm said it found Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders neck-and-neck in the three other states voting Tuesday -- Illinois, Missouri and Ohio.
The Clinton campaign has spent much of its time in North Carolina at historically black schools, and devoted a good deal of its TV and radio advertising to talking about gun violence, policing and racially charged incidents. Former President Bill Clinton visited Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte last week, and Mrs. Clinton pledged to help break down barriers in voting, education and health care at Hillside High School in Durham.
In the Republican primary, Donald Trump appears poised to continue his run of success in Southern states. He led Texas Sen. Ted Cruz 44%-33% in a PPP poll released Sunday, well ahead of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, with 11%, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, with 7%.
At a campaign stop Monday in Hickory, Mr. Trump said he would protect North Carolina's economy from the type of trade deals that decimated the state's furniture and textile industries.
The appearance at Lenoir-Rhyne University was interrupted by protests, though there was no sign of the violence that broke out at a Trump rally last week in Fayetteville.
A North Carolina sheriff said Monday his office is continuing its investigation of violence at that rally, including the question of whether Mr. Trump or his campaign incited a riot. Mr. Trump's campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Cruz campaigned Sunday in suburban Charlotte and received an endorsement Monday from state Senate Leader Phil Berger, who said he liked Mr. Trump's energy but was worried about beating the Democratic nominee.
In some respects, it has been a relatively quiet election in North Carolina. Democrats and Republicans alike said they had received little mail from the candidates, and few phone calls or knocks on the door from campaign workers.
But activists said they were expecting high turnout, based on early voting results and the historic nature of a contested race in both parties. ""I suspect there will be a huge turnout, larger than we've seen in history,"" said Brent Heath, GOP chairman in Wayne County.

Election 2016: Clinton Challenges the Gun Lobby --- Taking on the NRA marks stark contrast with prior campaign and rival Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772050407?accountid=12768,"DURHAM, N.C. -- Hillary Clinton is making gun violence a central theme of her campaign, becoming the first leading presidential candidate to directly confront the National Rifle Association without the cover of a hunting license.
She is holding town halls with a group known as the Mothers of the Movement, composed of mothers of victims of ""gun violence, police and racially charged incidents,"" including Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager fatally shot by a white neighborhood-watch volunteer in 2012.
In Ohio, six leaders of the group, all of whom lost children in high-profile shootings or police altercations, are set to campaign on her behalf again this weekend, ahead of Tuesday's Democratic primary.
""She's the only candidate trying to do something about gun violence,"" said Gwen Carr, whose son, Eric Garner, died in New York in police custody in 2014.
The former secretary of state's confrontational stance toward the NRA is a shift from her first presidential run, and it could encourage candidates running for Congress or state legislative positions to follow.
In 2008, she tried to ease gun owners' concerns by associating with them, much as her male counterparts have done in the past. While the men often talked about hunting trips or posed in camouflage, Mrs. Clinton shared her memories of learning to shoot a gun when she was a child.
Mrs. Clinton's calculation is that attitudes toward expanded background checks and new regulation of gun-show sales have changed enough in the aftermath of a succession of mass shootings to lower the political risks.
Yet her positions are already drawing the ire of the NRA, an organization with more than five million single-issue voters who are renowned for punishing politicians who cross them -- including presidential candidates.
""She lies about the issue in a way to make it seem reasonable, to really advance a radical gun-control agenda,"" said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker, who accused Mrs. Clinton of oversimplifying a complex set of laws and exploiting victims of gun violence.
If Mrs. Clinton wins the nomination, the showdown over guns could influence the outcome in several critical swing states won by President Barack Obama in 2012 that also have pro-gun constituencies, including Colorado, New Hampshire and Virginia.
Mrs. Clinton talks up the fact that she is challenging the gun lobby in her stump speech. ""It is time, my friends, we stand together and say enough,"" she said. ""I stand with the families of Sandy Hook,"" she added, referring to the 2012 school shooting in Newton, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults.
Registered voters overall are more concerned the government would go too far in restricting gun rights, at 52%, than fail to do enough to regulate access to firearms, at 44%, a December Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found. But the survey also showed a deep partisan divide, with 74% of Democratic primary voters saying they were worried government would do too little, and 73% of Republicans worried it would do too much.
That partisan edge makes the issue a useful foil in Mrs. Clinton's primary battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has tried both distancing himself from and explaining his own record on guns, which includes voting to prevent gun makers from being held liable for products they sell.
Mr. Sanders, who represents a pro-gun state and who only recently became a Democrat, has highlighted his ""D- minus"" rating with the NRA in some debates. In a March 6 debate in Michigan, he took a different tack, casting his vote in free-market, economic terms.
""If they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you are really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America,"" Mr. Sanders said.
His response prompted an NRA tweet saying he was ""spot-on"" in his argument.
The Sanders campaign didn't immediately respond to request for comment.
Crimes involving guns have been trending down for years, yet highly publicized mass killings are on the rise.
A Federal Bureau of Investigation study found an average of 16.4 active-shooter incidents a year between 2007 and 2013, up from an average of 6.4 a year from 2000 to 2006.

Donald Trump Calls for GOP Unity in California Convention Address Marked by Protests; Republican front-runner makes the case that he is best positioned to beat Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785375000?accountid=12768,"BURLINGAME, Calif.--Republican front-runner Donald Trump, campaigning in California following fresh primary victories, called for party unity during an address at the state's GOP convention while protesters denounced him and clashed with police outside.
At the lunchtime gathering, Mr. Trump said he was best positioned to beat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup. He said he would put into play New York, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania in November, states that have backed the Democratic nominee in most recent presidential elections.
""The Republican Party, in a presidential sense, doesn't win anymore,"" Mr. Trump said. ""You pick your standard cookie-cutters...I am different, because, I am going to win states that nobody else can.""
Protesters gathered outside the hotel near San Francisco before Mr. Trump arrived. Some of the protesters rushed past barriers to get to the hotel but were blocked by police from the doors.
Mr. Trump avoided the scene in a moment captured by cameras: His motorcade of dark SUVs pulled to the side of the road, and Mr. Trump and an entourage of men in dark suits and ties walked across a median strip of grass to enter the hotel through a back entrance.
""That was not the easiest entrance I have ever made,"" Mr. Trump said, once on stage. ""My wife called, she said there are helicopters following you, and then we went under a fence and through a fence, and, oh boy, it felt like I was crossing the border, actually.""
Speaking for just under 30 minutes, Mr. Trump lauded himself and his victories in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware on Tuesday. And he derided attempts by some in the party to deny him the nomination through a convention battle as evidence of a ""rigged system.""
Mr. Trump also mocked attempts by rivals Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich to form an alliance against him as ""total weakness"" that had come apart.
""These are politicians, folks, they can't make a deal,"" he said. ""How are they going to deal with China?""
""We have to get together as a party because it is a tougher road to the presidency for the Republicans,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And you really have to pick somebody that knows what is happening, that is really, really good. I accept the position.""
The New York businessman was the first of the Republican presidential candidates slated to address California's GOP convention. All of the GOP candidates plan to campaign in the delegate-rich state that could play a decisive role in choosing the party's nominee for the first time in a generation.
Mr. Kasich was scheduled to address the audience Friday night. Mr. Cruz will speak on Saturday, as will Carly Fiorina , whom the Texas senator this week picked as his vice-presidential running mate.
Mr. Trump has a big lead over Mr. Cruz, but he can't reach the 1,237-delegate threshold to clinch the nomination on a first-ballot convention vote without winning at least some of the California delegates.
California's June 7 primary has 172 delegates up for grab, making it the biggest prize in this year's extended nominating contest. The last time the state figured so prominently in a Republican presidential primary was in 1964 when California helped Barry Goldwater beat Nelson Rockefeller. Mr. Goldwater lost the general election to incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson.
Officials in the Cruz and Kasich campaigns have recently begun discussions about which of California's 53 congressional districts each of them will campaign in to deny Mr. Trump delegates, according to people involved in the talks. The delegates are allocated on a winner-take-all by district system. That essentially creates 53 mini-elections, with 13 delegates awarded to the candidate who wins the popular vote statewide.
In California, so far, Mr. Trump appears to be sticking to a strategy of dominating media attention and drawing large crowds. He hosted a rally in conservative Orange County on Thursday evening. His reception there drew huge crowds of supporters and protesters. About 20 people were arrested and some reported minor injuries.
In Burlingame, before Mr. Trump's arrival at the airport hotel south of San Francisco, protesters joined by a percussion and horn ensemble blocked half of the street outside the hotel singing, ""When black lives are under attack, stand up take America back!"" and ""Aqui estamos y no nos vamos,"" in Spanish, meaning, ""We're here and we're not going.""
Bernie Brown, who identified himself as a member of the Tax Wall Street Party, stood on a sidewalk on the periphery of the crowd, holding a clipboard wearing a red ""Trump = Nazi"" hat in a style similar to Mr. Trump's signature ""Make America Great Again"" hat.
""Donald Trump, with his fascist rhetoric is not the type of person we need leading this country,"" Mr. Brown said.
Cat Brooks, of Oakland, Calif., one of the organizers of the protest, and a co-founder of the Anti-Police-Terror Project activist group, said she was offended by Mr. Trump's rhetoric but appreciated that he had exposed racism in the U.S.
""The one thing I would say about Trump that I appreciate is that...he has unmasked what we have always known is alive and well in America, which is a deep antiblack sentiment, a deep antibrown sentiment,"" she said.
Inside the hotel, Craig Morrison, 52 years old, of Bethel Island, Calif., said he had come to the convention just to hear Mr. Trump speak. Mr. Morrison, originally from New Zealand, and now a U.S. citizen, said he planned on registering Republican and voting for the first time in California's June 7 primary.
""I want to see the man in person, the man who is going to be our next president,"" Mr. Morrison said. ""He has brought a lot of people to the Republican Party, he has made politics very interesting again.""

"Notable & Quotable: Martin Amis on Hillary Clinton; 'She can make jokes. But we don't want her sounding like a flake. Every joke, therefore, must wear a joke badge.'",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786684773?accountid=12768,"From novelist Martin Amis's review of Hillary Clinton's ""It Takes a Village"" in the Sunday Times (U.K.), March 17, 1996:
It Takes a Village looks like a book and feels like a book but in important respects it isn't a book. It is a reelection pamphlet or a stump speech; it is a 300-page press release. At no point did I find myself questioning the benignity of the author's original impulse; indeed, the book is as sincere, in its way, as anything I've ever managed to finish. And yet there is also something horrible about it. . . .
First, we have to imagine Hillary, in the Old Executive Office Building, with her staff of fifteen women (and one man: what is he doing there?), plus Barbara Feinman and other helpers ""so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually,"" marshalling her manuscript. Their object is to reduce it to a condition of pan-inoffensiveness. This is a big job, because being inoffensive, and being offended, are now the twin addictions of the culture. Chapter by chapter, Village goes over to Bill's people, to see if they have a problem with this or are uncomfortable with that, and Bill's people bounce it back to Hill's people with what they are unhappy about, and so it goes on, until in broad daylight and full consciousness you confront printed sentences which read:
. . . ""The 1990 Census showed that young people without college degrees earn significantly less on average than those with degrees.""
""Brisk walking, hiking and bicycling are all good exercise and are great ways to spend time together.""
""In addition to being read to, children love to be told stories.""
By the time everybody's done, we are out there on the cutting edge of the uncontroversial.
As for style, well, the First Lady should not be seen to be solemn. She can make jokes. But we don't want her sounding like a flake. Every joke, therefore, must wear a joke badge: it must be accompanied by a plump exclamation mark. As in ""Sometimes Mother knows best too!"" Or ""So much for her grasp of physics!""
Colloquialisms are appropriate only when they come with a tamper-proof set of inverted commas. To say ""All of us blow our tops"" may give the impression that things sometimes get a little too ragged around here. But to say ""All of us 'blow our tops' "" suggests that the tendency is under control.",2016-05-05
Trump and Mrs. Clinton Go Home; A transcript of the weekend's program on FOX News Channel.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779768692?accountid=12768,"Paul Gigot: This week on ""The Journal Editorial Report,"" after bruising Wisconsin losses, the presidential front-runners look to the Empire State to regain their momentum. What's at stake in New York for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? Plus, with a contested convention now more likely for the GOP, at look at how it would work and just who would be making the rules.

***
Gigot: Welcome to ""The Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.
After bruising losses in Wisconsin Tuesday, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are hoping to regain their momentum, campaigning this week in the state they both call home.
Here with a look at what's at stake for both in New York's April 19 primary and beyond is Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor Dan Henninger, assistant editorial page editor James Freeman and columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady.
Dan, Hillary Clinton has lost seven of the last eight state contests to Bernie Sanders. What does that tell us about her candidacy?
Henninger: Well, before commenting on that, let's preface any comment about the Democratic candidates by saying that, by and large, Democrats say they would be happy with either candidate. OK?
Gigot: Right.
Henninger: That's not true on the Republican side. And the Democrats are going to unify eventually, I think.
The most interesting exit poll fact out of Wisconsin that I couldn't get over was the fact that when they asked Democrats in Wisconsin who would you prefer as commander in chief, 50% said Bernie Sanders and 47% said Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders could not be commander in chief of a deli, so what's going on?
Gigot: He barely wants a military to be commander in chief of.
Henninger: She has clear vulnerabilities, and obviously Democratic voters are not buying the argument she keeps making that she has experience. She's vulnerable on the honesty-and-trustworthy and freshness aspects of this campaign and Bernie is beating her time after time. Man, if he does it in New York, it would be really embarrassing.
Gigot: The Democrats--it's sort of been the powder-puff bowl, Mary. They're swinging at each other, but they're using Nerf bats. And now they're getting meaner. They're saying, ""Oh, you're not a Democrat,"" as Hillary says about Sanders. Bernie Sanders said, ""You're not qualified to be president."" Is it going to escalate further?
O'Grady: He lost a great opportunity to go after her on the email issue from the State Department. He said ""I'm not going to deal with that.""
Gigot: ""I'm not going to touch that.""
O'Grady: And that was really his great chance to sort of undermine her credibility and so forth. So, now, he has to depend on moving harder and harder left--blaming, you know, the Panama free-trade agreement for the Panama papers this week, and just basically trying to link her with something that's more related to the establishment--
Gigot: Big banks and--
O'Grady: --big banks and so forth. Yeah. You know, really her big vulnerability, I think, as Dan says, is authenticity. People just don't believe her when she talks. And it was funny this week, when she tried to get on the subway, and she said, ""Oh, I love the subway,"" and then she couldn't get on the subway. Then she paid $2.75, which no New Yorker would do for one stop.
Gigot: All right, let's turn--we'll see how it works in New York.
Let's turn to the Republicans, James, and Donald Trump's setback in Wisconsin. You see him in the polls now, leading in New York, leading in most of the Eastern states that are coming up later this month. How big a setback was Wisconsin or will that just be seen as an anomaly?
Freeman: No, I think it's a sign of things to come. Not necessarily in New York. He probably wins New York. They all win their home states essentially. Kasich won his home state, and he is trailing Rubio in the delegate count. I think, with Trump, beyond that, what Wisconsin showed is that Cruz is starting, unlike Trump, to pull other parts of the Republican constituency into his coalition. Cruz did better than he has before outside of the ""very conservative"" group. He did better with people who are thinking about electability versus Hillary Clinton, doing better with people who see him as a change, but also with experience.
Gigot: Here's the question. He doesn't seem to be doing that in the polls in New York or even in Maryland. He's trailing Kasich, in third in both of those states. And in Pennsylvania, it's very close between Cruz and Kasich. So, the question is, is he really uniting the Republican Party as he says to the anti-Trump vote, or was this just a one-off in Wisconsin where it wasn't a pro-Cruz vote--and I'm asking this question--but it was an anti-Donald Trump vote?
Henninger: Yeah. I think we're back--I think it was an anti-Trump vote. I think we're back to the same ball game we've been in for a long time. The polls any way suggest that in Pennsylvania and Maryland, Trump has got 35% or 37% of the vote. And in Maryland, Kasich and Cruz have about 24% between them. And in New York, it's over 50%. So essentially, the same set of dynamics. You combine the other two, they beat Trump. But Trump has a solid 35%.
Gigot: Respond to that, James. I don't see Cruz consolidating that anti-Trump votes.
Freeman: What we're talking about is the votes in Wisconsin.
Gigot: OK.
Freeman: Where Trump has been basically locked in to 35% to 40% of the Republican Party. That's been consistent for months and months, even as people have dropped out. Cruz is a candidate who is showing he has upside potential. Donald Trump, you see more and more downside with these negative ratings going up. So Pennsylvania, for example, this is another Midwest--certainly the western part of the state--Pennsylvanians thinking of themselves as Midwesterners. This is another place where John Kasich is not doing as well as he should in terms of his case on ability to appeal to that Midwestern blue-collar vote.
Gigot: Well, what does Cruz need to do to seal the deal and persuade more people? The problem in New York--in Iowa, he said he disdained New York values to get Iowa votes. Now, he's coming to New York and saying, ""I love New York."" That's not the best sales line. ""I hated New York values then. Now, I love you, baby.""
O'Grady: He's not going to do well in New York. But I think what we have to keep this mind here is that this is about collecting delegates. It's not winning states, as it were. And so, that means that what he has to do is go around and convince delegates who are going to be at the convention, who are going to be charged with choosing a candidate who can win in the general election, that's what the convention is about. And so he has to convince delegates, who are not bound to any candidate, to come over to his side, and that's what he's going to be working on. As much as he's going to be campaigning in these states, he's working on these delegates.
Gigot: Briefly, James.
Freeman: I just think New Yorkers--Republicans, conservatives--should forgive him for the New York values comment because--
Gigot: Because he didn't mean it?
Freeman: A lot of us here talk about the crazy people who run this city, this state. It doesn't--it bears some criticism.
Gigot: He really meant New Jersey.
When we come back, Ted Cruz's Wisconsin win making a contested GOP convention more likely, so just who would be making the rules in Cleveland?
***
Gigot: Donald Trump's loss in Wisconsin Tuesday makes it more likely than ever that Republicans will arrive in Cleveland this July without a nominee. So just how would a contested convention work?
Here with a look at the rules and who's making them is Wall Street Journal editorial board member Joe Rago, and editorial page writer Kate Bachelder.
Kate, let's try to--you've been looking into the rules. Let's try to demystify this for viewers. So who writes these rules and does this happen every four years?
Bachelder: Yes it happens every four years. So every four years, a committee is formed of state delegates--112 state delegates, two from each state and the territories. This committee meets before the convention and they pass a package of rules that will govern what will happen over the following few days. This has not happened yet.
Gigot: This always traditionally happens a week before the convention.
Bachelder: Correct.
Gigot: You can't have a convention if you don't write rules.
Bachelder: Absolutely. There's no convention if there are no rules on how it works.
Gigot: So the committee then makes its--they vote and they decide these are the rules to recommend to the floor and then delegates on the floor, all of the convention delegates, have to approve or amend them or whatever they do.
Bachelder: Absolutely. So, we're hearing a lot about Rule 40. And it's important to mention that this rule has not been adopted.
Gigot: What does that say? This is the one that says that you must get a majority of the delegates in eight states to be nominated on the floor.
Bachelder: Correct. Right. So, we're hearing a lot about this rule. Frankly, way too much because, first of all, this rule has not been adopted. It is in no force of anything right now.
Gigot: This is just from the last convention--
Bachelder: Right.
Gigot: --which doesn't apply to this one unless the rules committee writes it that way.
Bachelder: Right. And Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are presenting this as a fait accompli because it is in their interest to be the only ones on the ballot. Basically, if the rules committee recommends a package and it goes to the floor of delegates, they can do whatever they want and make the rules committee meet again; they can adopt them. And so, it is a majority of delegates that must approve and do anything at the convention, and not a cabal of a small committee of people.
Gigot: But if Trump delegates and Cruz delegates are on the committee, and they have a majority on the committee, and they want to write that rule from 2012 that says you must have a majority of eight states, they could do so?
Bachelder: They could do that, but this won't matter after the first ballot.
Gigot: OK. But these will be the rules in place to start. But then we go to the first ballot, and let's say Donald Trump's name is put in nomination and he doesn't get a majority. What happens?
Bachelder: Right. And that's the only question on the first ballot, if Donald Trump can win a majority. Then you go to a second ballot. This ballot will be mostly about: Can Ted Cruz assemble a majority?
Gigot: Now, after that first ballot, something like upwards of 60% to 73% or 74% of the delegates would be freed up, depending on the state and how people interpret them, however they want.
Bachelder: Right. Exactly. And that makes it very hard for Donald Trump, who will lose all of his bound delegates. So, you go to a second ballot, and say Ted Cruz can't get a majority, and so you go to a third ballot. At this point, a majority of delegates can say, we want to change the rules, no matter what the rules committee has come up with.
Gigot: And they can suspend and send it back to the committee to rewrite them?
Bachelder: Yes. Correct. They can ask the committee to meet again. They can suspend the rules. The way to think about this is, you need a majority of delegates, but once you have a majority of delegates, you can change the rules and you can nominate anybody you want.
Gigot: And I think the thing to keep in mind, Joe, is this is not going to be a secret cabal. The world's attention is going to be on this, and anything that happens will have to happen above board, and everybody will know it's happening. And the Cruz and Trump delegates will have a big say in this, in addition to the other rank-and-file Republicans who are delegates.
Rago: Sure. It's a totally open and transparent process. It's a little bit funny to watch Ted Cruz and Donald Trump already come out and say, well, there's a conspiracy brewing to steal the nomination from us. I mean, what are they so afraid of? If you can't get a majority of Republican delegates, you're very unlikely to get a majority of the country.
Gigot: But they could change--I mean, they could cut deals behind the scenes themselves with each other or with some of the delegates. And they could even, in the beginning, Kate, if I'm right, they could write the rules more restrictively than 2012 if they wanted to, and have a majority.
Bachelder: Absolutely, but they'd have to get the majority of delegates to go along, and then, if after a couple of ballots, if nobody is winning, the majority of delegates could make a different decision on how the want to govern the convention.
Gigot: Here we are on the floor--first ballot, second ballot, third ballot, fourth ballot, nobody can get a majority. So then other names get thrown in and that's when we have the possibility, unlikely as it probably is, that somebody else from outside the convention who has never run before--I mean not run this year--could get his name introduced on the ballot, Joe?
Rago: It's certainly possible. I mean, I don't think it's very likely because the convention is not only governed by a majority rule, but also by norms. It would be very unusual for the delegates, who are going to be dominated by Cruz and Trump partisan, to say, ""Well, we're just going to throw it to Paul Ryan,"" for example, the current conspiracy theory that's all over the Internet and cable news. I don't think that's likely. And I don't think Paul Ryan is likely to take a job where he's set up to fail.
Gigot: And the blowback could be, would be enormous. Although, look, you've got to nominate somebody.
Rago: Well--
Gigot: And if Trump or Cruz can't get it, somebody's got to get the nomination.
Henninger: The Cruz people are making it sound as though it's over once we have a nomination. No, it's over in November after the general election. And those delegates want to win that election, and that's what they're going to pick.
Gigot: And the bottom line is those delegates can do whatever they want ultimately, a majority, and nobody can do much about it, except the election in November.
All right, thank you all.
When we come back, he's promised to build a wall along the southern border and, this week, Donald Trump unveiled his plan to pay for it.
Trump: Who is going to pay for the wall?
Audience: Mexico!
Trump: Who?
Audience: Mexico!
***
Gigot: It's the signature issue of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, building a wall along the southern border and making Mexico pay for it. And in a memo this week, the Trump campaign outlined how it would make that happen--by targeting billions of dollars in remittances sent back to Mexico by immigrants living in the U.S.
We're back with Dan Henninger and Mary Anastasia O'Grady.
Mary, remittances are these payments. Who pays them? Whose money is it?
O'Grady: Remittances are earned. They are income earned by people living in this country, and then they send it home to their families from where they migrated from. And in the case of Mexico, there's about $24 billion that goes from Mexicans working in this country to Mexico every year.
Gigot: Each year. Now, but we don't know--some of those people are here legally, some of those people are here illegally.
O'Grady: Right.
Gigot: How do you tell the difference if the U.S. government is trying to stop those flows?
O'Grady: Donald Trump proposes, in this memo he wrote, he would force anybody who wants--any alien who wants to send money abroad to prove they're lawfully in the country. That means companies, banks and financial institutions, wire-transfer companies, anybody like that, would have to employ people who could certify that the documents somebody brings are valid.
Gigot: So you mean even though--if I wanted to send a check to Mexico, OK--and there are about two million Americans living in Mexico that are American citizens.
O'Grady: Exactly.
Gigot: So if I want to send a check to Mexico, I have to go to the bank and they would have to say let's see your birth certificate or some other proof of citizenship, otherwise you can't send a wire transfer?
O'Grady: Or a legal residency. Yeah, that would be the idea. That would be the idea.
Gigot: Wow.
Henninger: Paul, there's an aspect of King Canute to Trump's proposal. King Canute was the king who went down and sat down on the shore and ordered the oceanic tides to reverse and recede.
Look, the World Bank estimates there are this year going to be 250 million migrants in the world. Their remittances will total $600 billion. Twenty-four billion from Mexico, as Mary suggested. These flows are going on all over the world--in Latin America, for instance, between Mexico and Brazil, Brazil and Mexico, Mexico and Ecuador. All over Africa. The idea that you can stop that economic activity on that scale is simply feckless.
Gigot: You would think there would be black markets to go around this to--
O'Grady: For sure. I mean, there's a million different ways. When I go to Mexico, I use the ATM. I take pesos out of the ATM machine from my bank. And certainly a lot of illegals living here have family members or friends who are legal. So they can also use them to send the money.
Gigot: Does this--would this ultimately lead to capital controls on everybody, that if you really wanted to stop this, because Dan points to the practical problem, so do you--
O'Grady: Yeah.
Gigot: --you basically have to say we're no longer going to allow the ease of capital transactions between Mexico and the U.S.?
O'Grady: That's exactly right. The only way you could do it is with capital controls, and that's preposterous. I mean, the North American economy is so integrated right now in terms of manufacturing and commerce in general that if you tried to put capital controls--you mentioned, Americans living in Mexico. There are something like 30 million American tourists who go to Mexico every year. Then there's auto manufacturing, where different components of a car are made here, or in Canada or--
Gigot: Cash goes back and forth in return for the parts.
O'Grady: I mean, the supply chains are totally integrated. If you tried to put capital on that--Mexico is our second-largest country that we export to. So if you put capital controls on, you would kill the economy.
Gigot: Briefly, Mary, you've known Mexican presidents and finance ministers going back decades. How do you think they would react to that kind of an ultimatum?
O'Grady: They would not comply. They will simply say, we will not do it. Right now, in Mexico, one of the most popular things to do is to buy a Donald Trump pinata and beat the stuffing out of it. So Mexican politicians who are very populist themselves, are not going to comply.
Gigot: All right, thank you, Mary.
We have to take one more break. When we come back, our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.
***
Gigot: Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week. Kate, start us off.
Bachelder: This is a miss for Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor of California. This week, he signed a law that will increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour. And he said this was--may not make sense economically but it's part of living in a moral community. And this homily from the apostle Jerry will not resonate with people in the Central Valley who lose their jobs as a result of automation or fewer opportunities.
Gigot: Where they have really high employment in the Central Valley. All right. Joe?
Rago: Paul, I had to laugh this week as an email from the Consumer Product Safety Commission crossed my desk, warning that a line of Ivanka Trump scarves had been recalled for posing a severe burn risk. Now, naturally, these highly flammable products were made in China. And Mr. Trump doesn't apologize for outsourcing, even as he criticizes other companies from doing so. But the interesting thing is that the apparel industry is bringing jobs back to America, because we have much better quality control here. So Mr. Trump, for the sake of public safety, bring those jobs home.
Gigot: All right. James?
Freeman: Paul, this is a hit to Merle Haggard, who passed away this week--one of America's greatest singer-songwriters, inspired millions of people, and was a patriot even when it wasn't cool, even when it was tough during the Vietnam era. We owe him a great debt. And I think he has something to tell us now, which is ""The best of the free life is still yet to come."" He never lost his optimism about the country.
Gigot: All right.
Do you trust the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Joe, on the judgments about scarves?
Rago: Oh, boy, Paul, they're 100% rayon. Very dangerous.
Gigot: All right.
And remember, if you have your own ""Hit or Miss,"" be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC . That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel and all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.",2016-05-09
Election 2016: Tempers Flare as Key Contests Loom --- Democratic feuding escalates; Sanders advisers demand apology from Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777698964?accountid=12768,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Feuding between Hillary Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, escalated to new levels this past week, with the Vermont senator's campaign advisers demanding she apologize for saying they were ""lying"" about money she has gotten from the oil and gas industry.
Campaigning nonstop, both candidates are showing flashes of fatigue and impatience as the race barrels toward a series of key contests later this month in the delegate-rich states of New York and Pennsylvania. The sour tone could make it more difficult for the party to unify after the race is settled. A Wall Street Journal-NBC poll last month showed one-third of Sanders supporters can't see themselves voting for Mrs. Clinton in the fall if she becomes the nominee.
Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates, but she has lost five of the past six contests, and her campaign concedes she will be hard-pressed to win Wisconsin, where the primary is Tuesday. She is heading back there Saturday after three days of campaigning in New York. Fearing Wisconsin might be a lost cause, her staff once had considered making no more trips to the state and instead focusing on coming contests.
An indication of the contest's current tenor came at what began as a routine a campaign stop in Purchase, N.Y., on Thursday that ultimately produced one of the tensest moments Mrs. Clinton has had on the trail.
A group of Sanders supporters interrupted her speech, chanting, ""If she wins, we lose."" As they walked out, Mrs. Clinton said: ""The Bernie people came to say that. We're very sorry you're leaving.""
Later, on the rope line, a Greenpeace organizer asked about her campaign contributions from the fossil-fuel industry. Mrs. Clinton shook her finger at the woman, 26-year-old Eva Resnick-Day, and angrily said: ""I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about that. I'm sick of it.""
Ms. Resnick-Day said in an interview she was surprised by Mrs. Clinton's retort. In past encounters with Greenpeace activists, Mrs. Clinton has been cordial in discussing her record, Ms. Resnick-Day said.
A Clinton senior adviser, Jennifer Palmieri, said Mrs. Clinton was annoyed because she believed her record had been distorted. She has long supported renewable energy and is not beholden to the fossil-fuels industry, she said.
""Does it annoy her when people misrepresent her record? It does. And that's what you saw"" on the rope line, Ms. Palmieri said.
Steve Schmidt, a senior strategist in Republican John McCain's 2008 presidential bid, described Mrs. Clinton's reaction as the sort of ""tell"" one sees in a poker game -- a reflection of Mrs. Clinton's frustration that Mr. Sanders is hanging on.
""What it shows is Bernie Sanders is getting under her skin,"" Mr. Schmidt said.
Republicans circulated the video in hopes that it would produce a backlash that damages Mrs. Clinton.
""The finger in the face, hammering away with it, is not a good look, usually, in politics,"" said Bill Cunningham, a political consultant who has worked for Republicans and Democrats alike.
Yet the incident also provided a rare window into the emotions of Mrs. Clinton, who seldom veers off script and has faced criticism for lacking authenticity. Some voters might sympathize with her for a human reaction to what she saw as an unfair attack, other analysts said.
Democratic political consultant Steve McMahon, who isn't aligned in the race, said the exchange would only humanize Mrs. Clinton.
""If you believe your opponent is lying about your record consistently and maliciously, this kind of a reaction is perfectly understandable and perfectly natural,"" he said.
Clinton aides say what money the campaign has gotten from oil and gas interests is largely coming from workers who happen to like the former secretary of state. Employees in the oil and gas industry have donated $307,561 to the Clinton campaign, of a total of $160 million she has raised to date, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
The industry has given an additional $25,701 to outside groups backing the campaign, which have raised more than $55 million on her behalf. And registered lobbyists with clients in the oil and gas industry have raised more than $600,000.
Mr. Sanders's campaign has received $53,760 from oil and gas industry employees.
The oil and gas industry is far from Mrs. Clinton's largest backer. Wall Street, for example, has given more than $21 million to her campaign and outside groups supporting her.
No apology from the Clinton campaign appears in the works. ""Apologize for what? No."" Ms. Palmieri said.

Tom Perez's Clinton Bait; The Labor Secretary rewrites another law to beat up business.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787614393?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is said to be considering Tom Perez as a running mate, and the Labor Secretary is working overtime on his progressive resume. Take the Labor Department's new ""persuader rule,"" which gives unions another tool to bludgeon business.
The rule recently took effect and is supposedly intended to update the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which mandates that ""persuaders"" hired by employers to communicate directly with workers publicly disclose their clients, services and remuneration. Employers must also disclose this information. However, the law explicitly exempts from disclosure any advice an employer receives in confidence that is protected by attorney-client privilege, a bedrock legal principle that enables employers to seek counsel without worrying that their communications could be exposed in a legal proceeding.
Labor's new rule in effect nullifies this long-time exemption by requiring disclosures from employers and anyone engaged in ""actions, conduct, or communications that are undertaken with an object, explicitly or implicitly, directly or indirectly, to affect an employee's decisions regarding his or her representation or collective bargaining rights."" This could cover virtually all labor-relations communications.
For example, an employer would likely have to report asking a consultant to study the labor savings of moving to a right-to-work state. An attorney would have to disclose private discussions with an employer over a neutrality agreement to support a union's organizing campaign. Only communications in actual collective-bargaining negotiations and with internal counsel will remain exempt.
Here's the extra rabbit punch: The 1959 law requires that any persuader also must disclose all clients for which they provide ""labor relations advice or services."" This has rarely applied since most attorney-employer communications weren't deemed persuader activities. But now an attorney who advises Employer A about a union organizing campaign will also have to report if he's conducting, say, a sexual harassment investigation at Employer B. All of this information will be public.
As former American Bar Association president Bill Robinson told Congress, attorneys will be less willing to represent employers. And employers will be more reluctant to seek outside counsel on union-related issues and may thus become more prone to run afoul of multiplying federal rules. Large businesses can deploy in-house lawyers and consultants to skirt the rule, but small businesses will suffer as usual. The Manhattan Institute estimates the rule will cost about $60 billion over 10 years.
The beneficiaries will be unions, which don't have to report their own persuader activities. Their goal is to use private employer communications to bully businesses into backing their organizing campaigns.
Alabama Rep. Bradley Byrne has introduced a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to block the rule, which has already drawn legal challenges in Texas, Minnesota and Arkansas. Congress should vote to overturn it, and the courts should examine Labor's dubious justification for rewriting a 57-year-old statute.",2016-05-11
"Election 2016: As Sanders Wins, Clinton Looks Ahead",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786415846?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders won Indiana's primary Tuesday, giving his flagging presidential campaign ammunition to press forward and making plain front-runner Hillary Clinton's persistent trouble unifying the Democratic Party.
Mr. Sanders still faces a wide deficit in convention delegates and virtually no chance to close the gap. He picked up at least 43 of 83 pledged delegates at stake, but Mrs. Clinton took at least 37, according to the Associated Press.
Still, the late-in-the-game win by the Vermont senator creates an odd split-screen for the Democrats, with the Clinton campaign increasingly confident of her chances even as Mr. Sanders lays bare her weakness with a large slice of Democrats. Exit polls showed he again beat her among young people, white voters, political independents and people who most value honesty in a candidate.
The senator's win in Indiana also may make it more awkward for Mrs. Clinton to look past him, as she did this week. Confident in her delegate lead, she spent much of Tuesday campaigning in the fall battleground state of Ohio. Her campaign in recent days began hiring staff across states expected to be competitive this fall, and her advisers were in the early stages of a vice-presidential selection process.
Speaking Tuesday evening in Louisville, Ky., before the results were announced, Mr. Sanders noted how far his campaign has come since its early days a year ago and highlighted his strong support with young voters.
""That is important because it tells me that the ideas that we are fighting for are the ideas of the future of America,"" he said.
The speech showed Mr. Sanders in no mood for party unification, as some Democrats would like. He hit Mrs. Clinton on her paid speeches to Wall Street, her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her support for a $12-an-hour -- but not $15 -- federal minimum wage, which he thundered was ""not good enough!""
This month is likely to bring Mr. Sanders additional wins in a string of primaries in Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon and Kentucky.
The voting wraps up in June, with big prizes including California and New Jersey. Democratic rules allocate delegates proportionately, meaning the loser gets nearly as many delegates as the winner in close races, making it hard to catch up.
Mr. Sanders made a strong play for Indiana, spending $1.5 million in TV ads and headlining a half-dozen rallies. State rules were in his favor, allowing independents, who typically favor him, to participate in the primary.
Mrs. Clinton spent no money on TV ads and appeared at just three campaign rallies in Indiana. Campaign officials said they were husbanding funds raised for the primary campaign to spend later this spring and summer in states that are likely to be competitive in the fall.
""I think we had a good campaign"" in Indiana,Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday on MSNBC. ""We ran hard. But you know I'm really focused on moving into the general election.""
Mr. Sanders and his aides acknowledged it was virtually impossible for him to overtake her lead in pledged delegates, the type chosen by voters. Instead, they said he would work to win over superdelegates, party leaders who can vote for whomever they like and who currently favor Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin.
Indiana voters split along familiar lines, with Sanders supporters lauding the breadth of his ideas and Clinton supporters calling her more pragmatic, experienced and more electable in the fall.
""I think he's very relatable and I just agree with his ideas,"" said Sommer Hofman, a 17-year-old student in Carmel, Ind., who cast her first ballot for the Vermont senator on Tuesday.
""I like some of his ideas but I think the most important thing is that we win in November,"" said Jack Carrithers, 68, a retired ad executive from outside of Indianapolis.
Coming into the balloting, Mrs. Clinton had 1,645 pledged delegates and Mr. Sanders had 1,318, meaning her lead was 327. Including superdelegates, she had 2,165 delegates to his 1,357, according to Associated Press tallies. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to claim the nomination.

"Some Big Democratic Party Backers to Pool Spending to Support Hillary Clinton and Others; Unions and megadonor Tom Steyer target $50 million in funding for super PAC supporting presidential, congressional candidates",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788354681?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Some of the biggest political supporters of the Democratic Party have agreed to pool their money in a super PAC targeting $50 million in funding to pay for door-to-door campaigning in support of Hillary Clinton and other Democrats running in the fall elections.
The AFL-CIO labor federation and unions including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers and National Education Association agreed to join forces to fund the operation along with Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer.
Mr. Steyer and the groups pledged to contribute at least $5 million each to kick off the effort. Other Democratic donors and unions have been asked to contribute up to $1 million each to become a part of the new campaign entity, called For Our Future PAC.
In an interview, Mr. Steyer said it was ""highly likely"" other unions would join the effort. ""This is really an attempt to mobilize working families around key issues in battleground states,"" he said.

* Trump's Campaign Spending on the Rise (April 21)
Mr. Steyer, who spent more money on behalf of Democrats candidates in the 2014 election than anyone else, pledged to match donations to the new group up to a threshold, which he declined to disclose. The former hedge-fund manager turned environmental activist spent about $74 million on behalf of Democratic candidates in the 2014 election.
This latest super PAC is just one of several election efforts Mr. Steyer is funding this election. A few weeks ago, he announced he is backing, with no stated budget, an effort to go to more than 70 college campuses to get young people to vote for progressive candidates this election.
Labor groups had discussed the idea of forming a single super PAC for months, but a final deal was held up because of internal struggles over how it would be organized.
The Service Employees International Union, which was once involved in the talks, ultimately decided not to join the effort. The SEIU was the top-spending labor union in each of the last three presidential elections, accounting for more than $100 million in expenditures on campaign contributions, television advertisements and other spending in 2004, 2008 and 2012 combined.
The SEIU said it had decided that continuing what it has done in past elections ""is the best path forward"" for the union and its membership. ""So while we're not officially part of the group we will continue to collaborate with our partners in labor,"" said the union's national communications director Sahar Wali.
Each of the unions involved in the new campaign group has endorsed, or is expected soon to endorse, Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign.
The goal of the combined effort is to eliminate redundant spending on get-out-the-vote efforts and other election activities.
""While we want to win in our election fights, we have an eye towards building a diverse organization and coalition at the community level to work together and stay together over the course of time,"" said Amanda Brown, the campaign director for the group.
""Our model is to respect, empower and include communities of color and all organizations who want to work with us on a shared agenda and shared electoral goals.""

"Mayor Vies for Role in Race --- Delayed support for Clinton hurt de Blasio, but he could help her in New York primary",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778346699?accountid=12768,"Mayor Bill de Blasio's decision to withhold his endorsement from Hillary Clinton for six months -- a move that underscored her problems with the Democrats' liberal wing -- frustrated people close to the presidential candidate and simultaneously rankled some of the mayor's own advisers.
Some of Mr. de Blasio's supporters believe his delayed endorsement of the party's front-runner diminished his political sway in the 2016 race, which he hopes to influence from the left, leaving him a less valuable ally in his hometown.
Yet the mayor could still help bolster Mrs. Clinton in New York as the April 19 primary approaches, with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont challenging her liberal bona fides and Mr. de Blasio popular among liberals in the city.
Mr. de Blasio and Mrs. Clinton's campaign are planning an event before the primary, and the mayor often chats with Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said. On Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, is scheduled to headline a ""Women for Hillary"" town-hall meeting in Brooklyn.
But the mayor finds himself again facing questions about his relationship with Mrs. Clinton. On Monday, the mayor was notably absent when Mrs. Clinton appeared in Manhattan with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and City Public Advocate Letitia James.
Mr. de Blasio said Monday some were ""hung up"" on supposed tensions, but he supported Mrs. Clinton ""100%."" On NY1 this weekend, Mrs. Clinton said she and the mayor ""have a great relationship"" and share many values.
A Quinnipiac University poll last week showed Mrs. Clinton ahead of Mr. Sanders in New York, 54% to 42%, while other polls indicate her lead has narrowed nationally. But a defeat in her adopted home state could prove embarrassing. For Mr. de Blasio, the New York primary gives him a chance to step onto the national stage.
Mr. de Blasio, who ran Mrs. Clinton's successful U.S. Senate campaign in New York in 2000, drew criticism for withholding his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton for months last year, with some Democrats calling it disloyal. Mr. de Blasio had said he wanted to first hear Mrs. Clinton's policy plans before supporting her.
Last year, Mr. de Blasio tried to stage a presidential forum for candidates in Iowa -- but no one agreed to attend -- and he privately met with Mr. Sanders, angering the Clinton campaign, people familiar with the matter said.
In January, his inner circle and Mrs. Clinton's aides discouraged him from taking a trip to Iowa to campaign for Mrs. Clinton, but he still went, paid his own way and didn't appear with Mrs. Clinton.
The sight of the mayor door-knocking for Mrs. Clinton without appearing with her led many political observers to criticize the trip. Mr. de Blasio's aides repeatedly said he was on vacation when was in Iowa to back Mrs. Clinton and asked for privacy there. He later told political allies the trip didn't go as planned.
Other New York politicians handled the Clinton campaign differently. Mr. Cuomo and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, both Democrats, endorsed Mrs. Clinton as soon as she announced she was running for president.
Ms. Mark-Viverito, the first Latina to head the City Council, has traveled to support Mrs. Clinton at the invitation and expense of her campaign. On Monday, Ms. Mark-Viverito was on a press call organized by Mrs. Clinton's campaign to talk about immigration.
In an interview, Ms. Mark-Viverito said she never considered endorsing Mr. Sanders and spoke with Mrs. Clinton several times at events, while rolling out her endorsement in coordination with the campaign. ""She knows that I'm actively out there representing her,"" Ms. Mark-Viverito said. ""Whenever she sees me, she's appreciative.""
Among Democrats in New York, Mr. de Blasio's approval ratings remain above 60%. In recent weeks, he has trumpeted Mrs. Clinton on television and derided Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner.
The mayor told political allies -- many of whom backed Mr. Sanders -- that he agreed with Mr. Sanders on many economic issues but he didn't have the experience to be president. He has frequently made the argument that while liberals instinctively gravitate to Mr. Sanders, they should look at a range of issues and gauge government experience on foreign affairs and other issues when making a decision.
Yet Mr. de Blasio is unpopular among white voters and upstate voters, who largely backed Zephyr Teachout, a liberal Democrat who ran against Mr. Cuomo in 2014. The Working Families Party, a liberal, union-backed party aligned with Mr. de Blasio, has backed Mr. Sanders.
Voters at a rally for Mrs. Clinton in New York said they largely supported Mr. de Blasio but weren't sure how much help he would be.
""I think the people who already like Hillary like her with or without his support,"" said Raymond Martinez at the rally. ""And so it doesn't make that much of a difference.""

Election 2016: Superdelegates Come Under Pressure --- Some Clinton backers urged to change their stance after Sanders's recent victories,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778675003?accountid=12768,"Along with his takeout from the vegan chain Native Foods Cafe, Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado received this note: ""The constituency has spoken. Use your power wisely. Feel the Bern.""
Mr. Polis, a superdelegate who has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, acknowledged the pressure on him to change his position in a state where Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont handily won the Democratic caucuses. ""Even my food takeout is lobbying me for #FeelTheBern,"" Mr. Polis tweeted late last month.
Mr. Sanders's recent victories in Colorado, Hawaii, Washington, Alaska and elsewhere have left some other Democrats defending their decision to back Mrs. Clinton at the party's convention in Philadelphia this July.
And more could feel the pressure if Mr. Sanders continues to rack up wins. He won the Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday, notching his seventh win in the last eight nominating contests. Democratic lawmakers in Wisconsin including Rep. Gwen Moore and Sen. Tammy Baldwin backed Mrs. Clinton. All Democratic members of Congress are superdelegates.
Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who backs Mrs. Clinton, said he has had some ""robust conversations"" with constituents after Mr. Sanders won the state's Democratic caucuses on March 26, but doesn't plan to shift his stance.
""A lot of my strongest supporters are on both sides of the presidential campaign, but I have no doubt we'll be able to hang together and come back together during the convention,"" Mr. Schatz said Monday, adding a vigorous primary would strengthen the process.
As of Monday, Mrs. Clinton was leading the Democratic race in pledged delegates 1,243 to 980. When superdelegates are thrown in, her lead grows: 1,712 to 1,011. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Sanders's campaign has said that those superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials free to back whomever they choose -- should pay attention to Mr. Sanders's momentum and abandon Mrs. Clinton.
""A lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Sanders said on CNN in late March. ""I think their own constituents are going to say to them, hey, why don't you support the people of our state, vote for Sanders?""
So far, that doesn't seem to be happening. Mrs. Clinton has the backing of far more congressional lawmakers than Mr. Sanders and none have defected after Sanders victories.
""I am supporting Hillary Clinton and I will continue to do that,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and superdelegate, said last week in her home state, whose primary Mr. Sanders won in early February.
The Clinton campaign has said that the former secretary of state's victories in primaries demonstrate that more Democratic voters support her than Mr. Sanders, whose wins have largely come in caucus states with fewer participants.
""For most of the campaign, Senator Sanders has criticized the role that superdelegates play in the nominating process, but as he now campaigns without a clear path [to] the nomination that relies on the voters, he's aggressively courting their support,"" Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, said in a memo.
Superdelegates supporting Mr. Sanders have occasionally found themselves in the reverse situation.
Rep. Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was the first member of Congress to endorse Mr. Sanders. Last month, Mrs. Clinton won the Arizona primary. A superdelegate, Mr. Grijalva is still backing Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Grijalva said he isn't facing a backlash from his district over his endorsement, though he has questions about the role of superdelegates. While they remain part of the system, however, Mr. Grijalva said he would continue to support Mr. Sanders. ""My resolve is as strong as his, which is to keep going,"" he said.

"Election 2016: Trump, Clinton Seek Home-State Boost",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778650793?accountid=12768,"Presidential front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will turn their attention to New York this week, where they lead in polls and hope to use their home-state advantage after encountering bumpy stretches in a long race.
Mrs. Clinton has struggled to fend off Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, losing a string of states recently, and expects the April 19 primary in New York to give her a firewall as she seeks to clinch the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Trump's path to the Republican nomination has hit a difficult patch recently amid his controversial comments on abortion and national security and his campaign manager's being charged with battery. A victory in his home state would give him a significant boost in his efforts to avoid a contested GOP convention.
In an interview, the businessman said he would travel widely upstate, where there are serious economic problems that he described as ""very sad."" Mr. Trump said he plans to talk about terrorism, citing the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, and take aim at rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for criticizing him for having ""New York values.""
""I can't imagine any New Yorker wanting to vote for Cruz,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He doesn't like New Yorkers. He was mocking New Yorkers.""
Aides to Mr. Cruz didn't return requests for comment.
Last month in New York, Mr. Cruz previewed his arguments against Mr. Trump, saying New Yorkers would be reluctant to back the real-estate mogul because they know him better than the rest of the country does.
The senator noted that Mr. Trump gave campaign donations to a number of prominent New York Democrats, including Mrs. Clinton and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. ""So the next time you think of all the disastrous policies that have been foisted on the people of New York, you can thank Donald Trump for bankrolling those efforts,"" Mr. Cruz said.
Mr. Trump defended the donations, saying he gave to ""everyone"" as a businessman.
Among likely GOP voters in New York, Mr. Trump leads with 56%, while Mr. Cruz is at 20% and Ohio. Gov John Kasich at 19%, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.
Other than California, New York has the most delegates up for grabs in the remaining contests. The GOP gives away 95 delegates, while the Democrats award 291.
Ahead of Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates by 1,243 to 980. A total of 2,383 is needed to clinch the nomination. Mr. Trump had 737 delegates, Mr. Cruz had 475, and Mr. Kasich 143, with 1,237 needed to win.
The primaries this year have given New York, usually an afterthought in the nominating contests, a rare turn in the spotlight. Locals have joked about Mr. Kasich's choice to eat pizza with a fork while in New York City and about Mr. Sanders's saying city subway riders used tokens to pay, a long-abandoned method.
Mr. Cruz invoked former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to ban large sugary drinks -- Mr. Cruz was against it -- while praising police officers who turned their backs on the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, during a dispute more than a year ago.
The city's Democratic politicians, meanwhile, have publicly criticized Messrs. Trump and Cruz for their views on immigration and social issues.
The GOP candidates are likely to spend much of their time upstate, which contributes about 52% of the state's GOP registration, according to Bruce Gyory, a political consultant in New York. Republicans upstate vote far more frequently in GOP primaries than those in other parts of the state, he said.
Mr. Trump is likely to do better in the state's western portion but have more difficulties in the New York City suburbs, Mr. Gyory and other observers said, citing the struggling economy and more antiestablishment views there.
Among likely Democratic voters, Mrs. Clinton holds a 54% to 42% lead, according to the Quinnipiac poll. So far, in New York City she has campaigned in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.
Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator, is expected to mobilize labor unions and downstate Democrats, who have widely endorsed her, to fend off Mr. Sanders, who has played up his Brooklyn roots and support from the Working Families Party. Mr. Gyory said New York City is likely to contribute 50% to 55% of the primary vote.
Mr. Sanders needs to show he can dent Mrs. Clinton's support among black and Latino voters, who dominate the New York Democratic primary, said Bill Hyers, who managed Mr. de Blasio's 2013 mayoral campaign.
The Vermont senator will do well upstate, Mr. Hyers predicted, where liberal Democrat Zephyr Teachout performed better among white liberals than Mr. Cuomo in the last gubernatorial election.

Election 2016: Sanders Ups Anti-Clinton Rhetoric --- Senator says his rival's husband's presidency imposed hardships on African-Americans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779827997?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- A new rift in the Democratic race has opened up, with Bernie Sanders making the case that Bill Clinton's two-term presidency was harmful to the African-American voters who are among the most loyal groups in the Clinton family's political base.
The Vermont senator is vying to win over African-American voters in advance of the April 19 New York primary, and is seizing on a dust-up last week between the husband of his rival, Hillary Clinton, and a pair of protesters over crime and social-welfare policies dating to the 1990s.
Mr. Sanders's campaign also released a new TV ad produced by movie director Spike Lee that will air soon in New York. The ad features entertainer Harry Belafonte and civil-rights activists vouching for Mr. Sanders as someone sensitive to the struggles of racial and religious minorities.
Targeting Mr. Clinton carries certain perils. Polls show the 42nd president is popular among Democrats, and he enjoyed a particular bond with African-Americans during his time in office. And Mrs. Clinton has, in the primaries so far, carried overwhelming majorities of the African-American vote.
But racial politics are shifting, breaking along similar generational lines that have left Mrs. Clinton garnering more support from older women voters than younger ones.
Both of the Clintons have been on the defensive over tough-on-crime policies enacted when he was president. Hoping to expand his coalition, Mr. Sanders is advancing the argument that the Clinton presidential years imposed certain hardships on African-Americans.
In the exchange with protesters in Philadelphia on Thursday, Mr. Clinton defended his wife's use of the term ""super predator"" in a 1996 speech as an apt description for gang leaders preying on black neighborhoods. (She has apologized in the past for using the term.) Mr. Clinton also sought to justify signing a welfare overhaul that same year that imposed new work requirements and limitations on federal assistance.
Speaking at a campaign event at the Apollo Theater in Harlem over the weekend, Mr. Sanders called on Mr. Clinton to apologize for defending her use of the term.
When someone in the audience at the Apollo shouted that the ""super predator"" reference was code for ""black people,"" Mr. Sanders said: ""That's exactly right.""
Mr. Sanders was unsparing in his criticism of the welfare legislation, casting it as a cynical ploy to win votes. ""Do you all remember that?"" he asked the audience. ""The premise, which was a right-wing Republican premise, was that the problem was all these people were really living high off the hog."" A consequence of the new law, he said, was that ""extreme poverty . . . went up.""
Asked about the welfare law Sundayfollowing a rally in Queens, Mr. Clinton said: ""There's no question, as every independent analysis has shown, it led to a big drop in poverty. It's just that the people who were left should never have been abandoned, but it happened essentially after I left office.""
No candidate wants a surrogate to dominate the discussion. But Mr. Clinton has always cast a large shadow. Stumping on her behalf he routinely talks up her credentials, but he is also eager to discuss his own record, presenting it as a model for helping people improve their financial condition.

Election 2016: Probe of New York Mayor Is Poor Timing for Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779827989?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- Mayor Bill de Blasio is facing an investigation into his fundraising just as the New York Democratic primary heats up and he seeks to serve as a valuable surrogate for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Investigators led by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan are looking at whether donations to Mr. de Blasio and a group aligned with him were made in exchange for some kind of official act, people familiar with the matter said. On Sunday, Mr. de Blasio said, ""Everything we've done is appropriate.""
Reports about the investigation come as the Democratic mayor seeks to play a prominent role supporting Mrs. Clinton in advance of the April 19 primary. Mr. de Blasio served as Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager during her successful bid for a U.S. Senate seat in New York in 2000.
Mr. de Blasio appeared on national television Sunday to tout Mrs. Clinton's candidacy and was asked about the investigation.
""So you believe you're going to be totally cleared of anything with this?"" NBC's Chuck Todd asked the mayor at the end of an interview about Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
""Yeah,"" Mr. de Blasio said, ""and we have no information about an investigation happening to begin with.""
A Clinton spokesman said Mrs. Clinton was happy to appear with the mayor and looks forward to working together.
A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio said the mayor was proud to appear with Mrs. Clinton and ""will continue to vigorously support her"" through the primary.
Ed Cox, chairman of the New York state Republican Party, said party officials were training operatives to help defeat Mr. de Blasio's 2017 re-election bid, but didn't see the probe playing much of a role in the New York presidential primaries.
""You don't want to get in the way of a good investigation,"" said Mr. Cox, noting that the probe is ""making headlines on its own.""
As the New York primaries loom, the mayor has sought to reassert himself on the national stage after his delayed endorsement of Mrs. Clinton left his aides puzzled and hers frustrated. On Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton showed up with Mr. de Blasio at a Manhattan hotel, making a surprise appearance at an annual political dinner in which the mayor and the press corps roast each other.
""Thanks for the endorsement, Bill -- took you long enough,"" said the former secretary of state, playfully mocking the mayor.
The mayor didn't endorse her campaign for about six months last year as he tried to stage a presidential forum that no one agreed to attend.
A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said there is no plan to use the investigation into Mr. de Blasio as a brickbat against Mrs. Clinton.
""I think there's a lot of mutual respect there,"" said the spokesman, Michael Briggs, referring to the mayor.
Political observers said Mr. Sanders is unlikely to criticize the mayor because he needs blacks and liberals to support him over Mrs. Clinton. Mr. de Blasio's approval rating remains above 70% with blacks voters and 60% among Democrats.

Days after a confrontation with protesters in Philadelphia, Mr. Clinton was met warmly in Harlem, where he has long had ties and still keeps an outpost of his foundation's offices.
But later in the day in Queens, at a speech at the New York Hall of Science, the mostly enthusiastic crowd included a handful of protesters.
Some people there held up a large banner criticizing Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, according to Luke Brinker, a politics editor from Mic News, who posted a video of the protest on Twitter.
Seconds later, he said, a woman stood on a chair and began shouting at Mr. Clinton, but she was drowned out by chants of ""Hillary"" from the many supporters in the crowd. As the woman was escorted out by police, Mr. Brinker said, she called Mrs. Clinton a ""war criminal.""
A New York Police Department spokesman said on Sunday there were no arrests recorded at the event.
With the New York state primary approaching on April 19, Mr. Clinton was joined at three historic Harlem churches Sunday morning by local Democrats U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, Assemblyman Keith Wright and Councilwoman Inez Dickens.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, was originally invited to join the tour, but couldn't attend due to a prior commitment, a spokeswoman for his office said.
In Harlem, hundreds of people filled the pews of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, erupting into laughter and loud applause when Mr. Rangel referenced how some used to identify the former president.
""When we had Bill Clinton [in the White House], somebody said that Bill Clinton thought he was the first black president,"" said Mr. Rangel.
In multiple churches on the morning tour, including Antioch Baptist Church and Mount Neboh Baptist Church, Mr. Clinton complimented Harlem's rich cultural legacy, joking about his own aspirations to be a jazz musician.
Church audiences applauded Mr. Clinton when he touched on topics including the lead crisis in Flint, Mich., and police and community relations around the nation.
""You don't want to see any more kids shot on the street or in the case of New York City, a man strangled on the street for selling three illegal cigarettes,"" Mr. Clinton said, referring to Eric Garner, who died during a confrontation with the NYPD in 2014.
A Quinnipiac University poll from late March showed Mrs. Clinton ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 66% to 31% among New York's black voters.
Outside the Antioch Baptist Church, Barry Weinberg, 25 years old, said Mr. Clinton's visit felt like a ""homecoming."" He said he planned to vote for Mrs. Clinton.

Clinton Against American Energy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771109373?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton keeps following Bernie Sanders further to the left, and on Sunday she all but declared herself opposed to America's shale natural gas revolution. Even President Obama has tried to take credit for the domestic energy boom that has driven down the price of gas, home heating and more for Americans, but not Mrs. Clinton.
At Sunday's debate in Flint, Michigan, a college student asked the candidates if they ""support fracking?"" Mrs. Clinton's answer is worth running at length:
""You know, I don't support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one. I don't support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don't support it -- number three -- unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.
""So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that's the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.""
But the states regulate fracking so well that even the EPA hasn't been able to find evidence of more than minor groundwater contamination. CNN's Anderson Cooper then turned to Mr. Sanders, who replied: ""My answer is a lot shorter. No, I do not support fracking.""
This is amazing. The average price of natural gas plummeted some 60% between 2008 and 2012 thanks to the fracking boom, and families saved $32 billion in 2012 through lower energy bills, according to Mercator Energy. The poor benefit most, as low-income families must spend more of their earnings on energy bills. Yet Democrats who profess to care for the poor want to disavow lower-cost energy.
This is a new look for Mrs. Clinton, who promoted fracking around the world as Secretary of State. In 2010 she popped into Krakow to announce a global shale initiative, and in 2012 she dropped by Bulgaria to encourage the parliament to end a fracking moratorium. But now that she wants to be President she would regulate out of existence the livelihoods of tens of thousands in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Arkansas, and across the U.S.A.

Clintonomics Would Be Very Different Today; Federal spending went from 21.8% of GDP in the first quarter of 1995 to 18.6% when Bill Clinton's last term expired.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790812339?accountid=12768,"Regarding your editorial ""His and Her Clintonomics "" (May 18): The election of the Gingrich Congress in 1994 not only led to tax reductions; federal spending went from 21.8% of GDP in the first quarter of 1995 down to 18.6% by the time Bill Clinton was out of office. According to Paul Krugman, such spending restraint should have been contractionary, but people in the real world know that small government and pro-free enterprise policies are what creates booms.

The largest difference in the economy between now and when Mr. Clinton was president is demographics. Back then, the baby boomers had not yet started to retire. Now that this cohort is well on its way to exiting the workforce, there is nothing to replace the void that will be created by the boomers' reduced spending.
Retirees don't buy nearly as much ""stuff."" They've purchased what they need and don't have the money to buy more, even if they wanted or needed to. Also, on limited incomes and savings that are earning next to nothing, they'll be less likely to replace any but the most essential of items.
This situation is unprecedented in America's economic history and will require the sort of fresh thinking that has yet to be revealed by any of the front-running presidential candidates.

You can't give Bill credit for the dot-com boom, after all it was his vice president who invented the Internet. The end of the Cold War allowed the defense budget to decrease dramatically, making budget balancing really easy. One can't give Bill credit for ending the Cold War, but I agreed with his lowering the defense budget, after all I, too, thought we didn't have any enemies left. So maybe Hillary Clinton is right to want to enlist Bill in guiding the economy if she is elected--to take advantage of his good luck.

Libertarians Pick Gary Johnson and William Weld as Presidential Election Ticket; Party hopes the two former GOP governors can mount formidable third-party assault on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792297878?accountid=12768,"ORLANDO, Fla.--The Libertarian National Convention on Sunday chose a pair of former Republican governors as their presidential and vice presidential nominees, putting forward the most-experienced election ticket in the party's four-decade history.
Delegates gathered at a hotel here picked former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson as their presidential standard-bearer and backed Mr. Johnson's preference for former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld as the vice presidential nominee.
By selecting a ticket composed of veteran Republican officeholders, Libertarians were hoping to present voters with a credible alternative to presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, both of whom are likely to enter the fall election as the most unpopular presidential candidates in history.
Despite more than four decades on the national scene, the Libertarians haven't drawn more than 1% in a presidential election or elected anyone to federal office.
With polls showing more Americans open to a third-party candidacy in the 2016 election than ever before, Libertarians say they hope to draw from a well of disaffected Republican, Democratic and independent voters. The party is also likely to be the only third-party option on the ballot in all 50 states this fall.
Together, Messrs. Johnson and Weld have more than a dozen years of governing experience. Mr. Johnson was a popular two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, best known for his expansive use of the veto during his eight years in office and his support for the decriminalization of drugs. He ran for president in 2012 as a Republican before switching to the Libertarians, capturing the party's nomination and garnering nearly 1.3 million votes in the general election--the party's best showing yet.
Mr. Weld was elected twice in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, governing as a moderate Republican with liberal views on abortion, gay rights and gun laws.
""Fifty percent of Americans right now are registering themselves as independent, meaning new voters are registering themselves as independents. Where's that representation? Well, I happen to think it's libertarian,"" Mr. Johnson told reporters. ""I happen to think that most people in this country are libertarian, they just don't know it. Here's the great opportunity leaving here today.""

Robots for Trump (and Clinton); The robotic revolution will upend society even more than the information revolution.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791480540?accountid=12768,"No matter what happens in November, one big winner has already emerged from the ruins of America's 2016 election: the robot. Both major candidates have embraced policies that will ensure the accelerating replacement of low-wage workers with no-wage workers.
Under President Donald Trump, illegal immigrants and possibly even legal migrants will have a harder time finding work, meaning the businesses that now rely on their labor will turn to machines. Under President Hillary Clinton, a big increase in the minimum wage is certainly in the cards, in which case get used to ordering your Big Mac on a touch screen.
At the same time, robotics is advancing technologically by leaps and bounds. Driverless cars are looking more and more like the future of the taxi industry, thus cutting off one of the typical routes to employment for immigrants. Truck-driving, meatpacking, fast-food preparation and hotel cleaning are ripe for automation as well.
The robotics industry has so far concentrated on relatively high-end work--vehicle-assembly systems or medicine. But the combination of the minimum-wage hikes in cities and states dominated by Democrats and new pressures on immigrant workers will create a set of incentives for the world's robot-builders. They will begin to concentrate their efforts on building new categories of affordable and reliable machines to replace what used to be called entry-level jobs.
Medical robots have rapidly improved over the last decade, and systems that assist surgeons in complex operations such as spinal fusion are now common. In the near future autonomous robots will be able to perform simple procedures such as biopsies at a fraction of the cost of a fully manned operating room. From there the possibilities are endless: The technology needed to replace a hotel maid or a fast-food chef should be relatively simple.
Since 9/11, the U.S. military has poured billions of dollars into robotics research. The benefits from that investment are beginning to reach the civilian world. Robots that can walk on four or two legs have been built and tested, and although they have not yet been approved for use on the battlefield, no one in the military doubts that soon such systems will be widespread.
The societal effects of this robotics revolution are likely to be less benign than the results of the information revolution, but just as unstoppable. Young people will find it even harder to find entry-level jobs. Will unemployable youth turn to drugs and crime, or will they simply waste away in their parents' basements playing videogames?
One already troubled government program, Social Security, could be devastated by the robotics revolution. If ever-fewer human workers are paying into the system while larger and larger numbers of seniors are getting benefits, bankruptcy seems inevitable. Unless we can tax the robots?

Donald Trump Faces Uphill Climb in California; GOP candidate aspires to win state but trails Hillary Clinton in polls,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793681074?accountid=12768,"REDDING, Calif.--Donald Trump says he wants to become the first GOP presidential candidate in a generation to win California, but he faces a steep climb in the liberal, ethnically diverse state where he trails Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by double-digit margins.
Mr. Trump this week held a procession of California campaign rallies in advance of the state's June 7 primary, even though the Republican outcome is a foregone conclusion now that he has cleared the field of all rivals.
""They always give up in California as a Republican because they say you can't win,"" Mr. Trump said at a rally in Redding on Friday. ""I think we can win.""
Mr. Trump's travels provide opportunities to raise money from the state's deep-pocketed donors, road test his campaign operation and activate his base.
""This is part of building our volunteer and support base,"" said Tim Clark, Mr. Trump's California campaign director. ""The primary for us is serving as a helpful first run for what we will be doing in the general election.""
Mr. Trump has said he wants to contest a number of states Republicans have lost since the 1980s, including Oregon and New York. Yet California is probably the longest shot among his targets. The latest Wall Street Journal/Marist/NBC News poll of California found that Mrs. Clinton outpolls him 55%-31%; her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders beats Mr. Trump 62%-28%.
No GOP presidential candidate has won the state since 1988. Since then, the statewide political terrain has become so inhospitable to conservatives that most GOP candidates don't even try. The Republican National Committee, upon which Mr. Trump intends to rely heavily for help in the general election, doesn't even have a state director in California.
California's population is nearly 40% Hispanic, a group among which Mr. Trump is especially unpopular because of his anti-immigration rhetoric. A serious statewide campaign could cost tens of millions of dollars in California's vast and expensive media markets.
""It's almost impossible to see a way in which Trump becomes competitive in California, no matter how much money he spends here,"" said Dan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst who was communications director for John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign. ""The state's demographics are lined up against him in such a way to make it a virtual impossibility.""
Still, Mr. Trump's celebrity and knack for grabbing media attention gives him a unique advantage over other Republican presidential candidates: He doesn't have to spend the millions of dollars others have to establish their identities and make an impression.
Mike Madrid, a GOP political consultant who is an expert on Latino voting trends, said the state's political tilt and demographics are obstacles but that he has learned, while watching Mr. Trump's rise, to never say never.
""From a numbers standpoint, it looks mathematically impossible,"" said Mr. Madrid of Mr. Trump's ability to win California. ""But it was also mathematically impossible for an African-American to become president. If anyone was untraditional enough to put California in play, it's this guy.""
The cost of running a campaign in California is enough to deter any candidate from investing unless there is a clear shot at winning. The state campaign-spending record was set in the 2010 governor's race when GOP candidate Meg Whitman raised $177 million--and lost to Democrat Jerry Brown by 54%-41%.
""When you have an in-the-box Republican, spending $100 million is not enough,"" said Tony Strickland, a former California state senator who is heading a pro-Trump super PAC. ""But here we have a candidate who has 100% name I.D. and can get on TV and get a message out"" without spending a lot of money.
The last time a GOP presidential candidate won California was 1988 when George H.W. Bush beat Michael Dukakis. Much has changed since then, most notably a big increase in the Hispanic population.
In 1990, the census found the Hispanic share of California's population was 25.8%. In 2014, it was 38.6% and surpassed the share of the white population.
Democrats have been the primary political beneficiaries of that demographic shift, especially after Republicans spearheaded a controversial 1994 ballot initiative, Proposition 187, that cut off state benefits to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.
Former President George W. Bush took a stab at competing in California in the 2000 campaign, emboldened by his success in appealing to Hispanic voters while governor of Texas. But he lost California to Democrat Al Gore by 53%-42%.
Mr. Trump's crusade against illegal immigrants risks undercutting GOP efforts to mend relations with Hispanics, who in California are predominantly recent immigrants.
Tayde Aburto, a Mexican immigrant in San Diego who is president of the Hispanic Chamber of E-Commerce, is trying to organize anti-Trump opposition in the Hispanic community.
""I see no path to victory for Donald Trump in California,"" Mr. Aburto said.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump's bold talk about winning California will translate into real time and money at crunch time this fall, when his resources might be better spent in more competitive states like Ohio and Florida.
For now, Mr. Clark says the Trump campaign has offices in San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles, Fresno, Sacramento and the Bay Area, and is ""mobilizing tens of thousands of volunteers.""
Ron Nehring, former chairman of the California Republican party who was a spokesman for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's onetime presidential campaign, said California poses a daunting test of the theory that Mr. Trump can keep winning as he did in the primaries, without the fundraising, ground game and voter-data apparatus that power most contemporary campaigns.
""Donald Trump has demonstrated no seriousness about waging a competitive campaign anywhere, much less in California,"" Mr. Nehring said.
Mr. Clark said Mr. Trump has shown that he can defy demographic predictions by expanding the electorate to turn out new, disaffected voters--and do so without a big-budget campaign.
""Donald Trump is a game changer; he is energizing an entire group of voters that hasn't participated in 10-plus years,"" said Mr. Clark. ""That changes the dynamic of how a race is won in California. Mr. Trump has proven he can run a very lean and efficient campaign, and produce high level results.""

"'Off the Reservation' Is a Phrase With a Dark Past; Hillary Clinton's use of the phrase, rooted in the forced relocation of Native Americans, has drawn criticism",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787138065?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton made a regrettable choice of words in a CNN interview last week, when she was asked about Donald Trump's attacks on her. ""I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak,"" she told Jake Tapper.
After the interview aired, Mrs. Clinton's political director Amanda Renteria ""walked back"" the ""off the reservation"" remark, noting on Twitter that the expression has ""some very offensive roots."" Mr. Trump pounced on her word choice in his signature backhand style, telling CNN, ""I won't even bring up the fact the Indians have gone wild on that statement. You know that? OK? The Indians said that that statement is a disastrous statement, and they want a retraction. I'm not going to get into that.""
Some Native Americans have indeed complained about the expression, with a continuing discussion on Twitter using the hashtag #OffTheReservation. As many observers have noted, the roots of the phrase clearly go back to the way American Indians were rounded up on reservations, beginning with the Indian Removal Act of 1830.
Newspaper databases reveal that starting in the mid-19th century, the phrase began appearing in literal contexts, in which Indians who were found ""off the reservation"" faced dire consequences, especially during times of war. In 1855, a San Francisco paper, the Daily Placer Times and Transcript, reported that ""every Indian between Crescent City and Yreka"" had been sent to a reservation, with an order made ""to shoot all the Indians found off the reservation."" ""This had the desired effect,"" the item tersely concluded.
Usage of the expression increased in the 1870s and '80s as the U.S. Army engaged in conflict with Apache nations in the Southwest.
The artist and writer Frederic Remington must have picked up the expression while documenting the Apache conflicts. When Remington accompanied the Fifth Army Corps to Cuba in the Spanish-American War, he used the phrase in an expanded way. After the cavalry was ordered to dismount and go on foot, Remington wrote in Harper's Magazine in 1898, ""I was nearly overcome by a desire to 'go off the reservation' "" and complain to officials or even quit his position.
Even before that, other writers were finding more figurative uses for ""off the reservation,"" particularly in politics. An article in the Cleveland Plain Dealer in August 1892 told of internal strife in the Republican Party, which had just nominated President Benjamin Harrison for re-election, despite a faction led by New York political boss Thomas C. Platt that sought to nominate James G. Blaine instead. Party chairman Thomas H. Carter, it was reported, privately ""expressed a great deal of concern at the persistent refusal of Tom Platt and the other 'New York Hostiles' to come in off the reservation.""
During the 20th century, people often deployed ""off the reservation,"" without much thought about its origins in the policy of Indian removal, to describe politicians who strayed from the party line. In these more sensitive times, the expression's unsavory history is harder to ignore.

Election 2016: Clinton Seeks Unit To Help Migrants,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780734154?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- Seeking to press her case to Latino voters, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she would create a national Office of Immigrant Affairs that would coordinate government policy on the issue if she reaches the White House.
The announcement came in conjunction with an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton by the New York State Immigrant Action Fund, one of New York's largest immigrant-rights groups, and less than a week before the state's Democratic primary, where a substantial portion of voters are expected to be Hispanic.
The new office would coordinate programs across federal, state and local governments, and would work to help integrate immigrants, refugees and their children into communities, the Clinton campaign said. An aide said the office would help undocumented immigrants as well as those in the U.S. legally.
Mrs. Clinton said she would propose $15 million in competitive grants to fund community navigators who would help guide people through the immigration system. She would also work to help people eligible to become citizens, a process she said was too complex.
Mrs. Clinton and her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have sought to paint themselves as the stronger supporter of immigrant rights. The Sanders campaign on Tuesday spotlighted Mrs. Clinton's onetime opposition to granting driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, while Mrs. Clinton hit Mr. Sanders this week for voting against a 2007 immigration overhaul.

"Election 2016: Sanders Makes Bold -- and Risky -- Moves --- Trip to Vatican, harsh attacks on Clinton and her husband precede a crucial April 19 vote",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780733058?accountid=12768,"ALBANY, N.Y. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders is taking some of the boldest and potentially riskiest steps of his campaign ahead of the crucial New York primary, hoping to raise his profile and undercut Hillary Clinton's support among a key part of the Democratic electorate.
After his debate with the Democratic presidential front-runner on Thursday, Mr. Sanders will leave the U.S. to appear at an academic conference at the Vatican devoted to themes of economic and social justice. Both issues are at the core of Mr. Sanders's message. But some Democrats are baffled as to why he would drop off the campaign trail for two days before the April 19 primary, where more delegates are at stake than in any other state save California.
""My advice to Bernie would be: 'Don't go to the other side of the Hudson River. Stay here where you belong,' ""said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based Democratic strategist not aligned with either candidate.
Leading up to the primary, Mr. Sanders has also escalated criticism of both Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who remains a popular figure in the party. Only 9% of Democrats said they viewed Mr. Clinton negatively in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in February.
Appearing in New York's Harlem neighborhood last week, Mr. Sanders said at a forum devoted to race relations that the welfare overhaul signed by Mr. Clinton in 1996 was a campaign ploy to win voters at the expense of the poorest Americans.
""Bernie is a fighter, and he understands clearly what he needs to do to move forward,"" said Gary De Carolis, an ally when Mr. Sanders was mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s. ""He will be tougher and tougher on the issues that he thinks [Mrs. Clinton] is vulnerable on.""
In campaign stops in New York, Mr. Sanders has grown more caustic about the six-figure fees Mrs. Clinton earned in speeches to New York financial firms. ""Not bad for a day's work,"" he said at a recent rally in Albany. He is taking aim at what polls show is one of Mrs. Clinton's biggest points of vulnerability: perceptions that she is too close to Wall Street.
At a recent speech in Rochester, he faulted her for benefiting from super PACs that take money from financial interests. Wall Street has given more than $17 million to outside groups backing her, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said Mr. Sanders's latest tactics undercut his vow to focus his campaign on issues. ""In the last week, Sen. Sanders has questioned Hillary Clinton's qualifications, her judgment and most recently her credibility,"" he said. ""If that doesn't amount to a personal attack, I don't know what does.""
The moves by Mr. Sanders could test Democratic unity. Should she win the nomination, Mrs. Clinton will need to rally Sanders supporters and create a united front against Republicans in the general election. But Mr. Sanders's attacks are resonating with his voters. At rallies, he typically doesn't try to silence the crowd when they start to boo at the mention of her name.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll this month showed that 30% of Sanders supporters in New York said they wouldn't back Mrs. Clinton in the general election.
Mr. Sanders's moves come at a make-or-break point in his candidacy. He continues to draw boisterous crowds of young supporters. On Wednesday, he picked up endorsements from New York City's transit union and also Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon. Mr. Merkley becomes the first of Mr. Sanders's Senate colleagues to endorse him.
Despite winning eight of the last nine contests, Mr. Sanders hasn't put Mrs. Clinton's lead in jeopardy. A preliminary Associated Press tally shows that in what has been his most successful stretch, the last nine contests have only cut into her lead by 71 pledged delegates. Mrs. Clinton currently enjoys a lead of 251 pledged delegates.
That makes the New York primary close to a must-win proposition for Mr. Sanders, some Democrats say.
Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist who isn't aligned with either candidate, said: ""For Bernie to have any hope of ultimately prevailing, he's got to start winning every big state by big margins. If he doesn't win New York, he's going to soon look like a spoiler and not an insurgent.""
People close to Mr. Sanders say he has no interest in playing that role -- weakening Mrs. Clinton to the point that she might lose in November.
John Franco, a longtime friend of Mr. Sanders, said in an interview he recalled an early discussion in which Mr. Sanders made clear he didn't want to be a ""spoiler."" ""That conversation was settled in five minutes,"" Mr. Franco said.

"Trump, Clinton, Tarullo? Bank Investors Have Lots to Ponder; Possible outcomes for regulation and the Fed are in focus as election moves to new phase",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794650595?accountid=12768,"The presidential battle lines are now clearly drawn between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. For bank investors, though, the picture remains blurry, and not just because the candidates' ultimate attitudes toward Wall Street are still tough to fathom.
There are two other crucial issues related to the election that could impact valuations. First, is whether the make-up of the next Congress makes it more or less likely that legislators try to reopen the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul. Although that could benefit banks, altering the rulebook could actually cause more disruptions during an already challenging time for profitability.
Second is who will lead the regulatory charge at the Federal Reserve. Given legislative gridlock, this could have a more immediate impact.
Currently, that person is Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, one of the chief architects of the post-crisis regulatory system. But there's a chance 2017 may see him depart after what would be eight years in the role.
Mr. Tarullo has in the past been heard expressing a desire to leave the Fed, according to a person familiar with the matter, but had decided to stay because certain regulatory initiatives weren't yet finished. Now, with most of them in place, the election could provide him with an exit point.
What is more, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the president appoint a vice chair of supervision at the Fed. This is the role Mr. Tarullo holds in practice. But he doesn't have the formal title.
The simplest explanation for this: the White House figured Mr. Tarullo wouldn't win Senate confirmation given animosity among banks over the tough line he has taken in bringing Wall Street to heel and questions about the Fed's approach to too-big-to-fail banks.
The election could change the status quo, though. If Mr. Trump wins the White House, it would seem likely he would nominate a vice chair for supervision. Even if Mr. Tarullo stays, the new person would assume supervisory authority.
Change may be in the offing, too, if Mrs. Clinton wins. New administrations tend to want their own people in top roles. There would also likely be calls to fill the still-vacant Dodd-Frank role. Granted, Mr. Tarullo was an official in President Bill Clinton's administration, so an exit isn't a given.
Still, investors have to ponder potential consequences of a change.
The Fed under Mr. Tarullo hasn't tried to break up big banks. Instead it essentially gave them a choice: stay big and be effectively taxed through higher capital charges, or shrink. Should the Fed pursue a different approach, it would have big implications for business models, bank structure and valuation.
Then there are the Fed's annual bank ""stress tests."" Mr. Tarullo has consistently honed these and often made them tougher. And last week he said that coming tests would likely incorporate a new, additional capital surcharge for the biggest, globally important banks.
Furthermore, the stress tests have a qualitative, as well as quantitative, aspect, that vests enormous power in the Fed and the person overseeing the process. So any change could affect banks' ability to return capital , and in turn the level of returns they can generate.
Ultimately, the Fed's course on interest rates will be the biggest driver for bank stocks. But its regulatory approach will determine how banks manage in any new rate environment.
Corrections & Amplifications
Fed governor Daniel Tarullo has consistently honed annual bank stress tests and often made conditions tougher. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that he has said he plans to make them tougher each year.

Mrs. Clinton Finally Clinches; A transcript of the weekend's program on FOX News Channel.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795775258?accountid=12768,"Paul Gigot: This week on ""The Journal Editorial Report,"" Hillary Clinton makes history as she clinches the Democratic presidential nomination. And Donald Trump's efforts to unite the GOP hit a roadblock after his controversial comments about a federal judge. Can Republican leaders change the subject as they lay out their own policy agenda? Plus, with rising premiums and shrinking options, Americans are feeling the ObamaCare pinch. We'll have an update after these headlines.
***
Gigot: Welcome to ""The Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.
Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday, making history as the first woman to top the ticket of a major political party. President Obama officially endorsed his former secretary of state in a video released Thursday, saying he is fired up and ready to hit the campaign trail, with their first joint appearance scheduled for Wednesday in Wisconsin.
Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor Dan Henninger, editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz, Washington columnist Kim Strassel and Best of the Web columnist James Taranto.
So, Dorothy, you saw the rollout on Tuesday, the victory. What did you think about that presentation?
Rabinowitz: I thought it was traditional and terribly professional and very heartwarming to her fans. And it must have come as a great surprise to all of the people, all of the public that has heard about this tired, worn-out hag, who's facing this great revolutionary who is going to run roughshod over her. And then, guess what? A huge kind of defeat for him, from everyone unexpected, including.
Gigot: This is for Bernie Sanders.
Rabinowitz: Yes, yes, yes. The independents came out for her, everyone else.
Gigot: California.
Rabinowitz: That's right. And of course there's nothing like a little taste of victory to make the candidate look even more glowing.
Gigot: All right, James, and you saw, I think, the big news this week is the degree to which the Democratic Party is uniting behind Hillary Clinton. And it was choreographed quite well. First, you had Elizabeth Warren come out, and then Barack Obama come out, and then Joe Biden come out. And then President Obama meets with Bernie Sanders in the Oval, gives him the photo-op as they walk out, and then he takes the poison and says, ""I'm dropping out of the race.""
Taranto: And let's not include the mainstream media, which have treated this essentially as the coronation of a queen as opposed to a victory of a democratic politician.
It's true, the Democrats are very united now, at least the Democrats in Washington.
Gigot: Right.
Taranto: Mrs. Clinton clearly won decisively, even though she won much--I mean, it was much harder for her than it was supposed to be. Nobody thought Bernie Sanders would get as far as he did. If we were talking about this a year ago. I don't know if Bernie Sanders's name would have even come up. So I think there are--she does have to win over some of those Sanders supporters, who might otherwise be inclined to stay home or vote for the Green Party.
Gigot: What did we learn about the way she's going to run against Donald Trump, Dan?
Henninger: I don't think we have quite learned how she's going to run against--
Gigot: Really?
Henninger: Yes, I don't. Because--
Gigot: I think I got an indication. I don't think it's going to be morning in America.
Henninger: It's not going to be morning in America.
Gigot: I think it's going to be nightmare in America if Donald Trump wins.
Henninger: She's going to run against Donald Trump, saying he's not temperamentally fit. I think that's risky, because Donald Trump will escalate and start attacking her personally.
Gigot: Sure.
Henninger: And I--he'll put her on her heels for the entire campaign, if that's the course she takes.
The bigger question is, whose politics is she going to run? Is she going to run on the politics of Bernie Sanders or of Bill Clinton? And I say that because I think Hillary still believes that the winning politics at the presidential level in America are somewhere in the center. She always had one foot in the center during those debates. But now, after Bernie Sanders and all this negotiation with Bernie, the question is: Will she run more clearly as a progressive?
Gigot: And, Dorothy, Bernie Sanders pulled her to the left during the primaries. Is she going to move back to the middle or not?
Rabinowitz: Yes, I think she is. I think, if you look at her, the absolutely intractable force that she ran and the stubbornness. If you run this way, if you've been looking for this role for most of your adult life, you are not going to allow yourself to be anyone but your own self, ultimately. It may not show up until she--if she ascends to the presidency. But I don't think she is going to allow herself to be seen as entrapped by devotion to Bernie Sanders or Barack Obama.
Gigot: That's an interesting point, Kim, because one of the things I think we saw this week with President Obama's choreography and enthusiastic endorsement was the degree with which he wants her to win. He views a Hillary Clinton victory as an extension of his legacy and, in some ways I think it's going to be his job to mobilize the Obama coalition that isn't all that thrilled about her. I'm talking about young people in particular, and minorities. But he really wants her to win.
Strassel: Yeah. That's why I slightly disagree with Dan and Dorothy. I think she is going to run far more to the left, because she certainly positioned herself that way during the primary, and she still does have to win over those Bernie supporters, who are part of that coalition that you were describing.
Now, this is interesting because I think these are--this is Trump's real two openings, in that what you're getting here, and he's going to give an address on this next week, is the Clintons in all their 1990s unethical glory, still out there doing the same things. And he's going to hit on that. But you're not getting the 1990s Bill Clinton center-right economic policies. I think she is going to run to the left, and that Trump is going to hit her hard on that.
Gigot: Respond to Kim.
Henninger: I think she's taking some risk if she does that. Look, Bill Clinton was nominated in 1992 as a centrist Southern Democratic because the old San Francisco Democrats, who got wiped out in 1972 with George McGovern, could not win. And the question is: Has the Democratic Party changed? Yes, it has. It's now the party of the left. How much has the country changed? Is the country so far to the left now that Hillary could successfully run a campaign like that?
Gigot: I--James, go ahead.
Taranto: But complicating all of this ideological analysis is the fact that Donald Trump is not a traditional conservative and is in some ways--takes some positions that we would have considered left-wing before this year.
Gigot: That's why it's going to be a temperamental, personal attack I think she's going to use on Trump to disqualify him, or try to.
All right, we have to take one more break. When we come back, Donald Trump hits a roadblock in his effort to unite the GOP, as fellow Republicans criticize his attacks on a federal judge. So can congressional leaders move past the controversy as they lay out a policy agenda of their own?
***
Trump: You've given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall. . . . I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down. . . . I will make you proud of your party and our movement.
Gigot: Donald Trump Tuesday night, striking a more presidential tone as he tries to repair the damage caused by comments he made about the Mexican heritage of a federal judge. Trump said this week that he was, quote, ""disappointed and surprised"" by the criticism he received from Republican leaders. Those leaders, in the meantime, are trying to change the subject as they roll out their own domestic and national-security agenda.
We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel, James Taranto, and Wall Street Journal editorial board member Joe Rago also joins the panel.
So, Kim, the Donald Trump comments were almost universally denounced among Republican leaders. How much damage has this done to his campaign to unify the GOP?
Strassel: Well, I think you know that even he realized the damage because he did, in the end, come out with a statement that was meant to try to put the issue behind them.
Gigot: Right.
Strassel: And that came because you suddenly had rumblings again out there among delegates that are going to the convention, saying: Whoa, maybe this is not the right course. You had Republican leaders who had to call Trump and stage some interventions, and say: Look, you're losing your people out there, you still have not united the party and, by the way, you are missing all these opportunities to go after the person you really need to win against in November, and that is not a federal judge, it's Hillary Clinton.
Gigot: Yeah, and I think, Joe, the big fear here among a lot of Republicans is: Look, this is going to happen again--I mean, we may put this fire out, but this is Trump. And I think they fear it will happen through November.
Rago: This is who he is. He's said ""I'm not going to change,"" this is what you get. And I think one really worrying thing about this is he seems to be elevating his personal brand, the Trump Organization, over his own best interests in winning the White House.
Gigot: Because this--because the federal judge is presiding over a Trump University lawsuit.
Rago: That's right.
Gigot: Yeah.
James, can they repair the breach here, the Republican Party, or is this going to be something that's going to continue right through November?
Taranto: Well, I don't know. I suspect that it will continue in various forms. It will erupt in different ways between now and then. It's a problem because Donald Trump is an amateur as a politician. And professional politicians can deal with this sort of issue when it's a professional politician. I mean, the Democrats didn't have a problem back in the '90s when the Clintons and their surrogates were poisoning the well against Ken Starr in order to discredit his investigation, which is sort of what Trump is doing here. He's doing it in a very--
Gigot: Ham-handed way.
Taranto: --ham-handed way. And I don't think the professionals know how to deal with it.
Gigot: Paul Ryan is in a position where he says, look--he condemned the remarks, like everybody else, in very forceful terms and yet, he said I'll still vote for Donald Trump. That's where Mitch McConnell is. That's where most of the professionals that James describes are. And then they get criticized for doing that because they're saying: Well, wait a minute, you don't have the courage of your convictions. If he's going to say something racist, how can you support him? It puts them in a very tough spot.
Henninger: They have to find a way to stop talking about things Judge Curiel and whether Trump's a racist. They need something else to talk about. And I think Paul Ryan--there is an opportunity here. Ryan is releasing the House Republicans' agenda, and I think there are parts of that that Ryan and Trump ought to be able to get together on. There will be a tax policy that's going to be very close to Donald Trump's. On energy, they're very close together. And I would even say even on poverty that Trump, who does say he's going to be able to campaign in black areas, he could align himself with that. Start talking about some of the things that Ryan is pushing, and there would be a commonality there that other Republicans, as well, could hook on to.
Gigot: Do you think, Joe, it's unfair for some critics to suggest that Ryan should repudiate Trump as the nominee of the party?
Rago: No. Look, Democrats are going to run a party-of-Trump campaign. I think it's incumbent on Donald Trump to behave in a more responsible way or he's going to have these problems all the way through.
Gigot: Right. But if you're the speaker of the House, can you really say, ""You know what, I'm going run against the--repudiate the nominee of the party that all these Republicans have voted for""?
Rago: Paul Ryan is an institutional leader. He's got an institutional responsibility to think about the larger Republican Party. If that means protecting the House, if Donald Trump goes down in a landslide, he's got to do things like that.
Gigot: So, he needs to be able to criticize, but you don't criticize Ryan for saying he'll vote for Trump.
Rago: No, I don't think so. I mean, he's a Republican. He's made the conclusion that Trump is better than Hillary, and I think he's making the best of a lousy situation.
Gigot: James?
Taranto: I would criticize Ryan for allowing himself to be baited into using the word ""racist"" in respect to Trump. He should have been more circumspect in his choice of words. That was an unforced error on his part.
Gigot: But you don't want him--Do you think he should he repudiate Trump?
Taranto: No, of course not. You can't repudiate the nominee of your party. As Joe as says, he has institutional responsibilities.
Gigot: All right.
Kim, what about this issue, you wrote a column this week saying that in some sense there really isn't a Trump campaign, a national campaign. He's not raising the money he needs to; he doesn't have any real organization to speak of. Does he really--and he's saying: You know, I don't need that. Is that true?
Strassel: He clearly does. He clearly does. I mean, here's the thing. I think Trump thinks, look, he broke all the normal political rules during the primary. He didn't do it the way anyone had done it before. I think his belief is: OK, I'm going to just wing it as well on the way to the presidency. But look at the last couple of weeks. It's been a disaster. He doesn't have a team and he needs one.
Gigot: OK, Kim, thanks very much. Thanks to all of you.
Coming up next, sticker shock is coming for millions of Americans shopping for a health-care plan under the Affordable Care Act. It's an ObamaCare update you can't afford to miss.
***
Gigot: Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell conceded this week that transforming the U.S. health insurance market, quote, ""hasn't been easy""--an understatement, and something Americans are finding out the hard way as they encounter soaring premiums and shrinking options. The nation's largest insurer, UnitedHealthcare, announced this spring that it would pull out of most of the ObamaCare exchanges. And other insurers have proposed double-digit rate hikes for the upcoming enrollment season. This as Ohio's health-care co-op prepares to close its doors, making it the 13th co-op to fail out of the 23 that were created under the Affordable Care Act.
So, Joe, what are we seeing across the country on this bill?
Rago: Right now, insurers are submitting their premium increases for 2017. We are seeing an average, across the country, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%.
Gigot: An average?
Rago: Average.
Gigot: Wow.
Rago: And then if you look at certain insurers--not fly-by-night insurers, but Blue Cross plans, for example, in Texas, New York, North Carolina--some of them are going 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%.
Gigot: Why is this happening?
Rago: You've got much lower enrollment than anybody expected. The people signing up on the exchanges are older, and more expensive and--
Gigot: Or sicker.
Rago: Sicker. They are consuming a lot more health care than anybody expected. And then you've got all kinds of structural problems with the law. Gaming--people waiting until they need a lot of high-cost care to sign up and then dropping coverage. So these are structural problems with the law, how it was designed, and people are taking advantage.
Gigot: The incentive--if you offer somebody the right to buy insurance, wait until they buy it until they're sick, which many people do--I mean, they have to pay a small fine, but some people are paying that fine, and saying ""I'm going to wait until I get sick"" and then you get the plan, that means you're really not providing the traditional risk pool that you do with insurance.
Rago: The problem is there's no incentive for people to keep continuous coverage over time. So this is really not sustainable, and you've got the big commercial insurers saying: Look, I want to participate, but we can't have our shareholders losing all this money on these ObamaCare plans.
Gigot: As they pull out of the exchanges that means there are fewer options for the consumers who do seek insurance.
Henninger: You know, Paul, the Kaiser Family Foundation tracks satisfaction with how the program is going. In 2014, dissatisfaction with enrollees was about 32%. This year, it's up to 43%. That's a pretty big jump. And the main reason are the premium increases.
Gigot: The price increases, yeah.
Henninger: It's just getting too expensive, and that means people will either decide to drop out all together or not take--sign up for coverage if you haven't signed up already.
Gigot: And meanwhile, many millions of the people who are enrolling in ObamaCare are doing it in Medicaid, which is fully on the taxpayer dime.
Rago: Oh, sure, and it's causing problems with state fiscal plans as they are doing their--
Gigot: What share of customers are on Medicaid? Do we know? It's a big chunk.
Rago: It's a lot. Most of the coverage gains from the Affordable Care Act have come through Medicaid expansion, not through the private insurance exchange.
Gigot: Kim, in the politics of this, how is this going to play in the general election?
Strassel: Well, it's interesting listening to Democrats, because somebody clearly put out a memo, and they have all got their new talking points. This is what you're goign to hear from them going into the fall, because they are worried about this. So their new argument is going to be: Look, this was a victory. This was a great victory because look at the way the whole system has changed. We now have fewer people who are uninsured. You can no longer discriminate against sick people. Younger Americans can stay on their parents' plan. And that's all great. We cannot go back. And yes, there's an affordability problem, and we will fix that going forward.
Gigot: Well, we'll fix it by adding price controls on drugs, by further expanding Medicare down to include people who are 55, who don't want to pay the ObamaCare premiums and get free government health insurance.
Rago: Right. Expand the subsidies. And what we always see in health care is that when one problem is created by government, it's solved by another government-created problem.
Henninger: And the idea that they will fix it plays into Trump's argument: They're incompetent.
Gigot: All right. We have to take one more break. When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.
***
Gigot: Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week. James?
Taranto: Paul, this is a miss to the prestigious American Journal of Political Science, which published a paper claiming that, and I quote, ""people who hold conservative political beliefs are more likely to exhibit traits associated with psychoticism."" Well, it turned out the researchers got everything backward and liberals are actually the psychotic ones, according to their definition. The journal ran a correction. I think maybe they should think about just taking the word ""science"" out of their name.
Gigot: All right, James. Dorothy?
Rabinowitz: Yes, Paul, this is a hit to two heroes who intervened when a young woman, they saw, was being sexually molested while lying unconscious. And this is the case of the infamous act of the judge giving the perpetrator only a few months. However, the two Swedish students who got off their bikes, chased down the attacker, were the key witnesses against him, stands out like the light out of the darkness of this case.
Gigot: That is the case in California, Stanford University. Dan?
Henninger: I'm going to give a big miss to the group called New York City Shutdown. They set on fire and burned an American flag this past week, protesting in the city over the police handling of an investigation involving a teenager who died during a gang confrontation. Well, burning an American flag is your constitutionally protected right as of 1989's 5-4 Supreme Court decision.
Gigot: Thanks to Justice Antonin Scalia.
Henninger: That's right. But listen, it is also my constitutionally protected right to say the desecration of the American flag is reprehensible and repellant no matter when you do it.
Gigot: All right. But they do have that constitutional right.
Henninger: They do.
Gigot: All right. And remember, if you have your own ""Hit or Miss,"" be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC . That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.",2016-06-13
Google Denies Accusations It Manipulated Searches for Hillary Clinton; News website alleges autocomplete service is biased in favor of Democratic presidential nominee,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795572708?accountid=12768,"Alphabet Inc.'s Google battled accusations that it manipulates its predicted-searches function to favor Hillary Clinton, the latest dust-up over the influence large tech companies exert in modern life.
Pop-culture news website SourceFed posted a video Thursday alleging that Google's autocomplete service, which tries to predict queries as users type, is biased toward Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
SourceFed, which is owned by Discovery Communications Inc., showed that typing ""Hillary Clinton cri"" into a Google search box yielded suggested queries related to crime reform, crisis, and a crime bill. It didn't include the suggested search ""Hillary Clinton crimes,"" although Google statistics show that search is more common than the suggested queries.

* FTC Looking at Complaints Over Google's Android Control
Google said in a statement: ""Google autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how autocomplete works.""
Google said the autocomplete software won't show ""a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person's name."" A person familiar with the software said the word ""crimes"" is included in the list of offensive terms. The person added that suggested queries are produced from a number of factors beyond the popularity of searches, including users' search histories and their locations.
The incident highlights the increasing role tech companies such as Google play as gatekeepers to news and information. Google has long maintained that its search engine is objective, but it has for years faced accusations that it skews results to favor its services over competitors.
Facebook Inc. last month changed how it assembles its ""trending topics"" feature of selected news stories after former workers said the social network was biased against conservatives. Facebook denied any bias .
In Google's case, SourceFed said typing ""Hillary Clinton ind"" yielded suggested searches about India and Indiana but not the word ""indictment"" -- even though indictment is a more popular search. The latter search refers to potential legal outcomes of her use of a private email server while secretary of state. However, a test of that claim on Friday showed ""Hillary Clinton indictment for emails"" was the first autocomplete suggestion. Mrs. Clinton has said repeatedly that an indictment won't happen.
Matt Cutts, a Google executive who is on leave, said on Twitter that the SourceFed video, which has been viewed more than 12 million times on Facebook, is ""simply false."" He said people often use Mrs. Clinton's first name when searching for news about an indictment. Indeed, typing in ""Hillary in"" yielded a suggested search of ""Hillary indictment.""
A spokeswoman at Discovery Communications representing SourceFed wasn't available to comment.
Rhea Drysdale, chief executive of Outspoken Media, a Troy, N.Y., digital-marketing firm, said the video has been widely shared because it plays into people's fears about the presidential campaign, and validates their political views.
Google has long tweaked its search-engine formulas to exclude things like profane or adult terms in autocomplete results, but the company has always maintained that it doesn't manipulate specific results, said Razvan Gavrilas, chief executive of CognitiveSEO, which helps marketers improve the rank of their websites in Google search results.
""It's hard for me to believe that Google manually changed"" autocomplete results, Mr. Gavrilas said. ""And if they did, it would be completely opposite to their business ethics until now.""
Some searches for potentially disparaging queries about presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump also don't show up in autocomplete. ""Donald Trump h"" yields suggested searches about his height and house, but nothing about his hair, which Google statistics show is a far more popular search.
Similarly, typing ""Donald Trump u"" shows queries for ""uncle"" or ""update,"" but not for ""university,"" though that is a more common search. Mr. Trump is facing a lawsuit that a school named after him cheated students.
Mr. Trump has denied the allegations.

"Election 2016: Poll: Negatives Rise for Front-Runners --- Clinton's favorability shows a steep decline, while Trump's gap is widest of any hopeful",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781479053?accountid=12768,"Both parties' presidential front-runners are growing increasingly unpopular, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, with Hillary Clinton showing an especially steep decline over the past month.
Among voters in both parties, 56% hold a negative view of Mrs. Clinton and 32% hold a positive view. That 24-point gap is almost twice as wide as in a Journal/NBC poll last month, when 51% viewed her negatively and 38% positively, a 13-point gap.
Republican front-runner Donald Trump continues to be the candidate in either party viewed most negatively, with 65% of registered voters viewing him unfavorably and 24% favorably, a 41-point difference. Unlike with Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, those numbers haven't changed much over the past month.
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump's nearest GOP competitor, has an image problem of his own. Nearly half of voters see him in a negative light, while 26% view him positively.
The entire field of candidates, on both sides of the aisle, suffers a popularity deficit: Not one is regarded favorably by more than half of registered voters.
The candidate with the least baggage is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also is the least well known. Some 31% of registered voters view him favorably and 19% view him unfavorably; 31% are neutral, and 19% don't know him or aren't sure.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton's primary foe, also has more fans than detractors: 45% of voters viewed him positively and 36% view him negatively.
Mrs. Clinton's decline came during a month in which she has been hit by an intensifying barrage of attacks, not just from GOP candidates but from Mr. Sanders, who has won a string of victories in primaries and caucuses.
Mr. Trump, similarly, has been outperformed by Mr. Cruz, whose campaign has been racking up delegates at smaller state conventions. Mr. Cruz scored another victory at the Wyoming state convention Saturday, where he picked up all 14 delegates up for grabs, following similar strong showings in Colorado and North Dakota.
The Cruz campaign also notched procedural wins Saturday in Georgia and South Carolina. In both states, Cruz delegates won trips to the national convention, even though Mr. Trump won both states convincingly.
In South Carolina, state law requires those Republicans backing Mr. Cruz to vote for Mr. Trump on the first ballot, given his big win in the state in February, but they can shift to Mr. Cruz in subsequent rounds of voting.
The campaign now shifts to the big prize of New York, the home state of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. Both front-runners hold sizable leads ahead of Tuesday's vote, according to polls.
All the candidates are viewed more favorably within their parties. Among Democrats, some 63% have a positive image of Mrs. Clinton, while 20% have a negative image. Mr. Sanders is viewed positively by 73% of Democrats, negatively by 11%
Mr. Trump is viewed favorably and unfavorably in equal measure among Republicans, with 42% seeing him in a positive light and 42% in a negative light. Mr. Cruz is viewed favorably by 45% of Republicans and unfavorably by 27%.
While some establishment Republicans dream of the party nominating House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as an alternative to Messrs. Trump and Cruz, he might not be a strong general-election candidate.
The poll found that 28% of registered voters view him negatively and 26% positively.
Last week, Mr. Ryan re-emphasized that he shouldn't be considered for the Republican presidential nomination.
The survey of 1,000 registered voters was taken April 10-14 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Election 2016: Democrats Spar in New York --- Clinton clarifies her minimum-wage plan as rival Sanders calls it 'not good enough',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781478892?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- The Democratic presidential candidates returned to the campaign trail Sunday in New York City for a two-day sprint to Tuesday's primary here, with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders exchanging tough words across town.
By day's end, Mrs. Clinton and her husband, the former president, had between them touched all five boroughs, plus suburban spots in Westchester County and Long Island, blanketing the metro area that will deliver as much as 70% of Tuesday's vote. Along the way she danced to Latin rhythms at a campaign block party.
Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, addressed a record-breaking crowd in a Brooklyn park. He also appeared at a public housing complex, released a plan for affordable housing and spoke at a Harlem church service.
Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, needs a big win in New York if he is to have any chance of closing Mrs. Clinton's lead in delegates. For Mrs. Clinton, who polls show is maintaining a double-digit lead, it would be deeply embarrassing to lose in her adopted home state where she had served as a senator.
Both candidates were back in New York after more than a day away from the state -- Mr. Sanders to the Vatican for a conference and a brief greeting with Pope Francis, and Mrs. Clinton for fundraisers including a high-dollar event at the California home of actor George Clooney.
The day began with both candidates appearing on Sunday talk shows. Speaking on ABC, Mrs. Clinton sought to clarify her position when she said she backed a minimum-wage increase modeled after New York's $15-an-hour plan, which will be phased in and sensitive to local economic conditions.
""We have to evaluate it as we go,"" she said. ""If the Congress passes that, of course I would sign it.""
The racial diversity of the Clinton coalition was on display Sunday as she began her day at a suburban African-American church, then campaigned in the largely Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights, in northern Manhattan. Most of the politicians who preceded her spoke in Spanish to a crowd that included many people who spoke little English.
After Mrs. Clinton's brief remarks, peppy merengue music played and the former secretary of state began bouncing to the beat. As her hands waved in the air, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat took them into his own and then twirled around her.
From there, she traveled to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, where a largely African-American crowd chanted ""Madam President!""
She took several shots at Mr. Sanders. ""It's easy to diagnose the problem. You've got to be able to solve the problem,"" she said. She lingered over the issue of gun control, a subject where the Clinton campaign believes Mr. Sanders is vulnerable.
Mr. Sanders on Sunday released an affordable housing plan that would expand a federal trust fund created in 2008 to finance such projects. He also called for promoting homeownership by expanding government-backed lending programs that allow borrowers to make small or no down payments.
Several other proposals overlap with those that Mrs. Clinton unveiled earlier this year. Both candidates support tougher curbs on predatory lending and expanded counseling for first-time home buyers.
At the center of Mrs. Clinton's plan, unveiled in February, is a $25 billion housing investment program that would build more affordable rental housing and boost homeownership for low-income Americans by matching up to $10,000 in savings for a down payment.
Later in the day, Mr. Sanders addressed more than 28,000 people under the bright sun in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, in what the campaign said was a record turnout. He laid into Mrs. Clinton on the familiar issues of fracking for energy, trade, her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and the minimum wage. He said her $12 wage-floor proposal was ""not bad, but not good enough. We need to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.""

"Election 2016: Sanders, Clinton Backed Disputed Law --- Crime measure from 1994 is blamed by some for high prison rates for minority men",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781140717?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, embroiled in a contentious New York primary, have been calling for changes to a criminal-justice system they say unfairly targets minorities. But both supported the landmark 1994 law that critics say helped foster the system they now attack.
The eruption of the 22-year-old crime law into the 2016 presidential campaign highlights a striking shift in the nation's priorities and political landscape over the past two decades. That is creating particular challenges for Mrs. Clinton, the spouse of a president who approved the law two decades ago.
""I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and have had a very unfortunate impact on peoples' lives,"" said Mrs. Clinton during Thursday's Democratic debate in New York.
Mr. Sanders said during the debate that ""what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.""
A testy exchange in Philadelphia recently between President Bill Clinton and a protester from the Black Lives Matter movement highlighted the issue. The protester blamed the crime law for the rise in incarceration, primarily of young black men, that critics say has left millions of people struggling to recover economically and socially.
Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said anger over the criminal justice system's impact on minority communities is well-placed. ""We've sort of blithely gone along all these years and let our prison population get bigger and bigger, and the impact has been felt most acutely by communities of color, particularly African-American men,"" said Mr. Travis, who directed the Justice Department's research arm in the Clinton years.
But Mr. Travis said it is simplistic to blame Mr. Clinton and the 1994 crime bill for the growth in the prison population. ""I am not sure there is a singular villain in this drama,"" he said.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who pushed for even tougher measures at the time, said the environment was completely different in the early 1990s. ""It's easy to forget what was going on,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Look at the current Chicago shooting and murder rate -- that was across the whole country."" Chicago has recently seen a jump in homicides.
Mr. Gingrich, a Republican, defended Mr. Clinton's initial response to the Philadelphia protester, in which he pointed out that many of the crime wave's victims were black. ""The people being killed in Philadelphia and New York were overwhelmingly minorities,"" Mr. Gingrich said.
The term ""super-predator"" also entered the lexicon at the time, describing a group of young people who ostensibly were particularly remorseless. Many have since questioned the concept, and Mrs. Clinton recently expressed regret for using the term.
The issue is becoming especially heated as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders appeal for minority votes. But the Clinton crime bill was only one of the era's tough laws spawned by fear of crime. By 1994, the prison population was already growing, in part because of changes to state laws that stiffened sentences.
Congress had also taken similar measures, including the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which abolished parole in the federal system, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which created mandatory minimum drug sentences.
From 1980 to 1993, according to Justice Department estimates, the total corrections population -- those on probation, parole, in state and federal prisons or in jail -- rose to 4.9 million from 1.8 million. The prison population alone nearly tripled, to 969,300 from 329,800.
That reflected the national mood. By 1994, the nation was inundated with news footage of crime scenes, blanket-covered bodies and grieving families, primarily in inner-city minority neighborhoods, as battles erupted over control of the crack cocaine trade.
The FBI estimated that over 72,000 people, nearly half of them African-American, were murdered between 1991 and 1993. ""Soft on crime"" became an epithet politicians avoided at all costs.
In contrast, the past two decades have seen plummeting crime rates, along with the rise of competing national priorities, especially terrorism and the economy.At the same time, black leaders, and officeholders across the political spectrum, have become alarmed at the high incarceration rate and relations between police and minorities.
Now, the view is widespread among Democrats and liberals that the 1994 law was flawed.
Ronald Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore School of Law, said the legislation had attracted a clash of competing interests, creating ""this ill-considered parade of ideas often not vetted through the committees of jurisdiction."" Mr. Weich was then counsel to Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), a key player on criminal justice issues who supported the final measure.
The finished product had good and bad points, Mr. Weich said, and Mr. Clinton urgently sought its passage as he headed into tough midterm elections.
Mr. Clinton wanted 100,000 more police officers on the street. Democrats including Mr. Kennedy sought gun-control provisions. Republicans wanted stiffer penalties.
Many of these provisions, including an assault-weapons ban, became part of the crime law, as did a measure giving some sentencing relief to minor players in drug enterprises.
But the law also created new criminal offenses and expanded the federal death penalty. More significantly, it provided grants for states that required prisoners to serve more time by reducing parole and early release, an approach supporters called ""truth in sentencing.""

City News: Clinton Takes a Ride on the Subway --- Candidate tries to buff New York credentials with trip on the 4 train; trouble at the turnstile,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779338284?accountid=12768,"The presidential candidates have been eager to prove their New York credentials ahead of the state's primaries this month, and on Thursday Hillary Clinton attempted to do so by hopping on the New York City subway.
At the Yankee Stadium stop in the Bronx, Mrs. Clinton, her aides and a horde of reporters embarked on a ride that most New Yorkers experience every day on their way to work -- albeit without the attendant U.S. Secret Service agents and a crush of cameras.
""I love it because it's so convenient,"" said Mrs. Clinton, who served eight years as a U.S. senator from New York, after boarding the 4 train to travel two stops uptown.
Mrs. Clinton, who has a home in Westchester County, N.Y., conceded it had been about two years since she last rode the subway. But her encounter with public transportation on Thursday appeared aimed at highlighting her relative familiarity with New York's transit system, in contrast with that of her Democratic primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Mr. Sanders, who grew up in Brooklyn, suggested in a recent interview with the New York Daily News that he believes the subway operates with tokens, which went out of use in 2003.
""I think it was my first term when we changed from tokens to MetroCards,"" said Mrs. Clinton, laughing as she spoke to reporters before boarding the train.
Mrs. Clinton, however, encountered her own hiccups. Attempting to enter the station, the former secretary of state took several swipes with her MetroCard but couldn't get it to work -- in all, she swiped it five times before the turnstile would allow her entry.
Once inside the station, Mrs. Clinton's aides tried to be mindful of the other passengers. ""Subway etiquette!"" they called out to reporters, urging them to let people off the train before trying to board.
En route, Mrs. Clinton chatted with Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., a Democrat, until they reached the 170th Street station.
As the train pulled into motion, a fellow passenger confided to an acquaintance on the phone that he would be late.
His explanation: ""Hillary Clinton is on the train.""

Election 2016: War of Words Mounts in Democratic Race --- Sanders says Clinton unfit to be president after a headline said she said the same,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779338236?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- The Democratic race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders detoured Thursday from high-minded debate over issues into a he-said-she-said squabble ahead of the presidential primary fight for New York, a contest with outsize importance to both candidates.
For Mr. Sanders, the state is a must-win if he is to have any chance of catching the Democratic front-runner. For Mrs. Clinton, a loss in her adopted home state in the April 19 primary would be deeply embarrassing.
Those stakes help explain the sharp exchanges in recent days as both candidates launched aggressive New York campaigns, including new television ads with messages tailored to different parts of the state.
Mr. Sanders charged that Mrs. Clinton wasn't qualified to be president -- but only, he said, because she said the same about him. But Mrs. Clinton hadn't called him unqualified; she declined to answer when pressed on the matter in an earlier TV interview.
""If Secretary Clinton thinks that just because I'm from a small state in Vermont . . . they're going to beat us up and . . . we're not going to fight back . . . they can guess again,"" he told reporters in Philadelphiaon Thursday.
Mrs. Clinton called the whole thing ""silly,"" even as her campaign sought to raise money off the claim that the former first lady, senator and secretary of state isn't prepared for the White House.
Later Thursday, in an interview with CBS, Mr. Sanders repeated that he was only making charges against Mrs. Clinton because he believed she leveled them first toward him. He said he will ""certainly"" support her if she is the Democratic nominee, but when asked directly if he believes she is ""unqualified to be president,"" he replied, ""Well, does Secretary Clinton believe that I am unqualified to be president?""
Mrs. Clinton has 1,280 pledged delegates, the type awarded by voters, to Mr. Sanders's 1,030. When superdelegates -- party leaders who can support anybody they like -- are included, she has 1,749 to his 1,061. A total of 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.
After New York awards 291 delegates, there are just three large states left -- California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- and Mr. Sanders needs to win all four with large margins if he is to have any chance to catch her.
Mrs. Clinton, who represented New York for eight years in the Senate and still calls the state home, begins with some clear advantages. New York primaries bar independent voters, who typically favor Mr. Sanders. And the electorate is expected to be about a third nonwhite, a group that has voted for Mrs. Clinton in previous contests.
Recent public polling shows Mrs. Clinton with about a 10-point lead, but Mr. Sanders has shown he can catch up as voting approaches and more people get to know him.
Each side has tailored one campaign for theNew York metropolitan area, which could account for as much as 70% of the electorate, and another for the rest of New York, known as upstate.
Mrs. Clinton's New York City strategy centers on increasing turnout among black and Hispanic voters. On Sunday, she visited three African-American churches in Brooklyn, where she spoke about the importance of tackling ""systemic racism"" and the need for gun restrictions.
One of three Clinton ads airing in the New York metro area is narrated by actor Morgan Freeman and is focused on victims of police violence and on her relationship with President Barack Obama. A second ad celebrates New York's diversity and hits Republican Donald Trump for his comments about Muslims and plans to build a wall along the Mexican border, another spot meant to motivate minority voters to back her.
Upstate, her events and TV ads focus on her work to boost economic development when she was in the Senate, including advocating for the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and its thousands of high-tech jobs. On Friday, she will travel to Buffalo for an economic round table, and campaign in Rochester.
Mr. Sanders, a Brooklyn native, is emphasizing his own New York roots. He pushed for a debate in Brooklyn, scheduled for next week. He drew 18,000 people to a rally in the Bronx last week and plans a large rally in Manhattan's Washington Square Park next week. Aides also note that eastern upstate New York borders Vermont, so people there have heard about him for years.
In a New York City metro area that is home to some of the richest and the poorest Americans, Mr. Sanders will focus on income inequality, and on Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street, said Tad Devine, his senior strategist.
Thursday'stiff over whether Mrs. Clinton is qualified or not began when the New York Daily News published an interview with Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton was asked three times on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" whether, in light of the interview, she thinks he is qualified to be president.
""I think the interview raised a lot of really serious questions,"" she said. ""I will leave it to voters to decide who of us can do the job that the country needs.""
The Washington Post, writing about the interview, included a headline that said she had questioned whether he was qualified. Mr. Sanders seized on that.
""When you have headlines in the Washington Post -- quote 'Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president,' my response is, well you know, if you want to question my qualifications let me suggest this, then maybe the American people might wonder about your qualifications, Madam Secretary,"" he said Thursday.
He suggested her past support for trade agreements, her vote to authorize the Iraq war and support from Wall Street interests disqualified her for the job.
Mrs. Clinton needs to drive up her support among women, particularly suburban women, a campaign adviser said. Mr. Sanders's comment could help with that, said George Arzt, a political consultant who is unaffiliated in the race.
""I think there are many people who view Hillary -- whether they like her or not -- as the most experienced and qualified in the field,"" he said. ""There are many women who believe that the 'unqualified' title has been used too often against women looking for better jobs.""

In response, Mr. Trump countered that the president ""prioritizes our enemy"" over the American people amid their rapidly escalating fight over how to best stop terrorist attacks.
In remarks in Washington, Mr. Obama took aim at the Mr. Trump's renewed call to bar Muslims from entering the country. He said such an approach toward immigrants would only serve to alienate American Muslims as well and weaken America's defenses.
""Are we going to start treating all Muslim Americans differently?"" Mr. Obama asked. ""It doesn't reflect our democratic ideals. It won't make us more safe, it will make us less safe,"" Mr. Obama said.
Groups like Islamic State ""want to claim that they are the true leaders of over a billion Muslims around the world who reject their crazy notions,"" Mr. Obama said. The president warned that ""painting all Muslims with a broad brush"" only advances terrorists' claims that the West is the enemy.
Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, knocked Mr. Trump on Tuesday in Pittsburgh with a similar message to Mr. Obama's, calling her rival's approach ""un-American"" and ""dangerous.""
Mr. Trump fired back, saying: ""President Obama claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people. When I am president, it will always be America First.""
In a tweet to the ""LGBT community,"" Mr. Trump pledged: ""I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.""
The heated debate over terrorism and immigration policy takes place as Mr. Trump is working to unite the Republican Party behind him. While he has the support of the Republican National Committee and many prominent Republicans, his controversial statements and policy stances continue to give some allies pause.
Mr. Ryan, who recently agreed to back Mr. Trump , said on Tuesday that the U.S. should tighten its screening process of refugees entering the country, rather than impose a religious test as Mr. Trump proposes.
""I do not think a Muslim ban is in our country's interest. I do not think it is reflective of our principles--not just as a party, but as a country,"" Mr. Ryan said.
The fight has been boiling up for several days. Mr. Trump used an appearance in New Hampshire on Monday to attack both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, portraying them as weak on foreign policy and national security.
""The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here,"" Mr. Trump said about Omar Mateen, the U.S.-born man police have said was the gunman. His parents emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan.
In an earlier television interview, Mr. Trump also suggested that Mr. Obama was sympathetic to Islamic terrorists .

""Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind,"" Mr. Trump said on Fox News on Monday. ""And the something else in mind--you know, people can't believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on. It's inconceivable. There's something going on.""
Mr. Obama also leveled his sights at his critics, including Mr. Trump, who have criticized him for failing to use the term ""radical Islam"" to describe terrorist attacks.
""Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away,"" Mr. Obama said. ""There is no magic to the phrase 'radical Islam.' It is a political talking point. It is not a strategy.""
Mrs. Clinton also said Mr. Trump was fixated on ""radical Islam"" as a magic word that ""once uttered, would stop terrorists.""
Usually Mr. Obama's remarks after National Security Council meetings are battlefield assessments, but on Tuesday he revealed his frustrations with the tenor of the campaign cycle with a fiery rebuke.
""There is not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn't use the label 'radical Islam.' Not once has an adviser of mine said, 'Man, if we use that phrase, we are going to turn this whole thing around.' Not once,"" Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Obama personally worked on the remarks he gave Tuesday. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Mr. Earnest said he wasn't aware of any direct coordination with the Clinton campaign on his remarks, but said the similarity wasn't a coincidence.
""President Obama and Secretary Clinton have similar approaches and consider the homeland security of the United States a top priority,"" Mr. Earnest said. ""They agree that these are principles worth fighting for and articulating and that the use of the word 'radical Islam' is a political talking point.""

Analysis: Jobs Downturn Mars Clinton's Narrative,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793871192?accountid=12768,"A slowdown in hiring this year threatens a record-long streak of jobs creation that Democrats see as one of their prime advantages in the fight to retain the White House this November, creating a possible headache for Hillary Clinton.
While one payrolls report in June won't define a long general-election campaign, voters' perceptions of the election-year economy begin to crystallize around this time of year. On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has closely aligned herself with President Barack Obama on a wide range of issues, including the economy.
""If you're Hillary Clinton, you're rooting for stronger jobs reports coming down the stretch here,"" said David Axelrod, the former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. ""A series of disappointing jobs reports would be headwinds for Hillary.""
The employment numbers landed days before Tuesday's closely watched California primary, when Mrs. Clinton hopes to wrap up her party's nomination after a hard-fought campaign against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The report also followed on the heels of Mr. Obama's defense of his economic stewardship in an Indiana speech, where he declared Americans better off ""by almost every economic measure,"" and called on voters to build on his policies by electing a Democrat.
Economists aren't predicting an imminent recession, but Friday's report showed other signs of softness.
The internals of Friday's report showed that many of last month's labor-force dropouts are middle-aged workers and those with less education, demographics that have been drawn more to Mr. Sanders and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. Monthly data tends to be volatile, but while employment has been down for most age groups since the last recession began in late 2007, younger and middle-aged men have experienced the largest declines.
Republicans were quick to hit on the lousy numbers. Mr. Trump tweeted that the report was ""terrible"" and a ""bombshell"" a few minutes after its release. The Republican National Committee called the jobs numbers ""devastating.""
""The timing is especially unfortunate for Democrats because the president has just declared that this is a great economy,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was economic policy director for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.
Mrs. Clinton defended the president's record on the economy, pointing to 75 straight months of job creation and saying that Mr. Obama inherited a terrible situation and pulled the country out of a ditch. Electing Mr. Trump would mean a return to failed Republican policies, she told CNN on Friday.
She added the latest numbers ""are disappointing to anybody, because we want to keep jobs growing."" She said her plan to invest in infrastructure projects would create jobs.
The White House put the best gloss on the numbers, with economic adviser Jason Furman reminding reporters that the strike by workers at Verizon Communications Inc. shaved 35,000 workers from payrolls last month. He also pointed to wage growth that has perked up this year.
Democrats also pointed out that the jobless rate is around half of what it was seven years ago, stock prices have nearly doubled, and home prices are up around 20%.
But if the May report isn't a one-off, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, Mrs. Clinton would need to deflect suggestions that her election would amount to a third Obama term. "" 'It's great under Barack Obama' isn't going to sound very good if this continues,"" he said.
Polls have shown that the economy is one area where Mr. Trump has an edge over Mrs. Clinton. A May Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 47% of registered voters said Mr. Trump would do a better job dealing with the economy, compared with 36% for Mrs. Clinton.
Moreover, independent voters' views appear to line up more closely with Republicans on the economy. In the same poll, some 52% of Democrats said the 2007-2009 recession still had a significant effect on people, compared to 68% of Republicans and 66% of independents.
The current expansion, now entering its eighth year, is the fourth-longest in the postwar period. Economists at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. saidFriday the probability the U.S. would enter a recession in the next 12 months had climbed to 36%, the highest for the current expansion cycle.
Other measures show better near-term growth prospects. Housing sales have risen steadily higher this year, as have auto sales. Manufacturing surveys have rebounded after last year's contraction, and the share of workers who said their employer was hiring in May reached the highest level tracked by Gallup since 2008.
Political scientists point to two gauges that rise above the rest in determining whether the incumbent party can hold the White House: the president's approval rating and the economic growth trend in the first half of the election year. Mr. Obama's approval rating in recent weeks has climbed above 50%, returning to levels last seen since his 2012 election, according to Gallup.
But economic growth has been unremarkable. Economists see growth rising above 2% in the second quarter after just 0.8% in the first quarter.
History shows how often elections turn on the economy. In 2008, what began as a referendum on the Iraq war broke for Mr. Obama against Mr. McCain when an economic slowdown turned into a financial crisis. In 2012, Mr. Obama defeated Mitt Romney even though the unemployment rate stood above 8% for most of the campaign, partly because job growth and consumer confidence were firming.
Democrats enter the election at something of a disadvantage because in the postwar period, only once, with George H.W. Bush in 1988, has a nominee succeeded a two-term president of his own party.

Election 2016: Sanders Closes Polling Gap With Clinton --- Tight race weighs on the Democratic front- runner as she tries to pivot to November,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781723664?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders has all but eliminated Hillary Clinton's polling lead among Democratic voters nationwide, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has found, offering signs that she continues to struggle with the primary electorate at a time when she wanted to build strength for the general election.
Mr. Sanders for the first time is close to tying Mrs. Clinton, as 48% of Democratic primary voters picked him as their first choice for president, while 50% picked her. In a poll last month, Mrs. Clinton was ahead by 9 percentage points, a 53%-to-44% edge.
A majority of states have already held their primary contests, and the Vermont senator's surge in support likely comes too late for him to overcome Mrs. Clinton's big lead in delegates to the summer nominating convention in Philadelphia. But the survey suggests that the long and bitter primary campaign has taken a toll on the former senator and secretary of state.
""As she is finishing this primary, she is not gaining strength,"" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. ""The cracks are showing, and she is losing strength.""
Mrs. Clinton's saving grace is the weakness of her potential Republican opposition. The survey found that GOP front-runner Donald Trump would have a harder time consolidating his party behind him than she would hers. Some 38% of Republican primary voters said they couldn't see themselves supporting the New York businessman, while 21% of Democrats said they couldn't support Mrs. Clinton.
In a hypothetical general election matchup, Mrs. Clinton outpolls Mr. Trump 50% to 39%, the survey found.
But for most voters, that would be a lesser-of-two-evils choice: 56% of both Trump and Clinton voters said their vote would be cast because they didn't want the other candidate to win.
""For these voters, casting their ballot for president in 2016 is not about an idealistic vision of hope and change or a new day in America,"" Mr. Yang said, ""but, rather, a much more sober and pragmatic feeling as they check the box: It could be worse.""
Among Republicans, Mr. Trump has maintained his advantage as the field of candidates dwindled. He is the first choice of 40% of GOP primary voters, compared with 35% for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and 24% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
But the poll could fuel his rivals' argument that Mr. Trump would be the party's weakest candidate against Mrs. Clinton in November: Mr. Cruz trails her by two points, 46% to 44%, in a hypothetical matchup, while Mr. Kasich outpolls her, 51% to 39%.
The two parties' front-runners are making history with the negative feelings they inspire. The share of voters who feel negatively toward Mr. Trump, at 65%, or Mrs. Clinton, at 56%, is unprecedented for a major-party nominee. By comparison, President Barack Obama was viewed in a negative light by 43%, and Republican nominee Mitt Romney by 44%, at the end of the 2012 general-election campaign.
""America is on the path to electing the most unpopular president since 1948,"" said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who also helped conduct the survey.
Measuring the front-runners' qualities of character, the poll found that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump are worse for the wear over the past six months.
Voters still rate Mrs. Clinton highly for the knowledge and experience she would bring to the office. But over the past six months, she has lost ground on two crucial qualities: Voters, including those in her own party, are less likely to see her as an agent of change and as honest and straightforward.
Just 22% of registered voters give her high marks for being able to bring real change to the country. Even among Democratic primary voters, the share giving her high marks dropped to 41%, down from 57% in October.
On being honest and straightforward, just 19% rate her highly. Among Democratic primary voters, those rating her highly dropped to 40%, from 52% in October.
Mr. Trump has also lost ground on key points. Voters are less likely to give him high marks on his signature claim: that he can get things done. Some 38% rate him highly on that quality, down from 48% in October. Among Republican voters, 64% rate him highly for effectiveness, down from 72%.
While ""telling it like it is"" is Mr. Trump's calling card, fewer voters now see him as honest and straightforward. The share who rated Mr. Trump highly on being honest and straightforward was 35%, down from 43% in October.
Asked which party is better equipped to handle foreign policy, voters picked the Democrats by a three-point margin. By a narrow margin, voters also saw the Democratic Party as better able to handle immigration.
That could fuel some Republicans' concern that the party's standing would suffer from Mr. Trump's harsh rhetoric about illegal immigration and his support for a reduced role for the U.S. military in world affairs.
But Mr. McInturff, the Republican pollster, said he didn't see signs that Mr. Trump was doing any ""damage to the Republican Party that is irreparable.""
Mr. Sanders's strong support among primary voters continued a steady narrowing of the gap since January, when Mrs. Clinton led by 25 points, 59% to 34%. In June 2015, a Journal/NBC News poll found Mrs. Clinton leading the Democratic contest by 60 percentage points, 75% to 15%.

Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: The Damage Sanders's Clinton Bashing May Do,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781723393?accountid=12768,"As the big New York primary election arrives, it would be a mistake to say the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination is dragging on with no end in sight. Despite tightening poll numbers, it's dragging on with a likely end still in sight: Hillary Clinton prevailing, both in New York and nationwide, because the delegate math works inexorably in her favor.
So the question increasingly is this: How much damage is she absorbing at the hands of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the meantime?
The answer: The damage is hardly fatal but it is starting to matter, especially in Mrs. Clinton's standing with crucial independent voters. The specific problem isn't merely that Mr. Sanders's tone has turned more harsh in attacking her. The particular problem is that his critique increasingly focuses on declaring she can't be trusted because she takes campaign contributions from big banks and big business. That is a line of attack that seems almost designed to hit Mrs. Clinton in her area of greatest vulnerability, which is voter doubts about her honesty and trustworthiness. The pattern continued Monday when the Sanders campaign accused the Clinton camp of possibly violating campaign-finance laws, prompting Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook to declare that ""the Sanders campaign's false attacks have gotten out of hand.""
Of course, this is the stage of a tough election race when it's common for partisans in either party -- or this year, in both parties -- to lament that a bruising primary season is hurting their chances for victory in the general election. And frequently those concerns turn out to be overblown. Certainly, Democrats lamented the length and tone of the long Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton fight in 2008, and that fight turned out to be, if anything, helpful in tuning up Mr. Obama for a big November win.
""I think Sanders is hurting Clinton with Republicans -- but they wouldn't have voted for her anyway,"" says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ""With Democrats and independents the effect is minimal. So real impact is marginal at best.""
Still, there is impact, as suggested by a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll that showed the share of voters who hold a negative view of Mrs. Clinton continues to grow. Perhaps of most concern to Democrats are the signs of souring views among independent voters. In January, the share of independent voters who had positive views of Mrs. Clinton stood at 35%, while 54% had negative views. In the new survey, just 20% of independents had positive views, while 62% had negative views.
There even is evidence of damage among soft Democrats -- that is, people who lean Democratic but aren't core partisans. Among that group, the share holding negative views of Mrs. Clinton grew to 32% this month from 21% in January.
Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster, thinks the ""aggressive"" Sanders tone is likely to backfire with Democratic women, who make up 59% of the party's primary voters. But she also worries it is eroding one of the party's key advantages this year.
""Originally, I think Sanders played an important role mobilizing voters and articulating an important economic and change message,"" she says. ""I think voters found refreshing the contrast with the Republicans of two candidates engaged in serious conversation about our country's future and offering a real platform. Now, with ridiculous, overstated attacks like Hillary isn't qualified, it makes us look as bad as the Republicans and turns off voters.""
The tone problem was on full display at a big Sanders rally in New York City last week, where one speaker, health-care activist Dr. Paul Song, said liberals' goal of achieving Medicare for all won't happen ""if we continue to elect corporate Democratic whores who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry.""
He later apologized and said he was referring to Democrats in Congress, not to Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Sanders said the remarks were ""inappropriate."" Still, the tone is the sort of thing that could give moderate Republicans who might otherwise never vote for businessman Donald Trump a reason to think about doing exactly that.
It's also rhetoric consistent with Mr. Sanders's broader critique -- she's a captive of special interests who will abandon average folks, on their behalf -- which threatens to exacerbate her biggest problem: In the new Journal/NBC News poll, just 19% gave her good marks for being ""honest and straightforward.""
Mrs. Clinton appears to have the upper hand in a general-election matchup against either Mr. Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But in either case, she'll need Sanders voters to show up. And it appears that in a matchup against Mr. Trump, a fair share of her vote would come from people embracing her as the lesser of two evils.
The problem with the Sanders attacks is he is close to portraying her as representing a kind of evil in the system, which threatens to erode that particular advantage.

Pyongyang Pans Both Trump and Clinton on North Korea Proposals; North Korean official says the country has 'no trust' in leading U.S. presidential candidates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797847845?accountid=12768,"ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia--North Korean government officials say proposals so far from the leading U.S. presidential candidates on the nuclear standoff with Pyongyang don't provide a path for resolving the crisis.
At a recent security conference in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar, officials from North Korea's Foreign Ministry made presentations to defend what they say is a need to continue a nuclear-weapons program to deter possible U.S. attack. U.S. government representatives didn't attend the conference.
The North Korean officials also reiterated a longstanding demand that Washington sign a peace treaty with Pyongyang before any discussion about ending the North's nuclear program. The U.S. says North Korea must first move forward on denuclearization.
In conversations with The Wall Street Journal on the sidelines of the meeting, the officials expressed skepticism that the next U.S. president would achieve a breakthrough in bilateral relations.
Presumptive Republican Party candidate Donald Trump has made frequent comments about North Korea during campaigning, including a pledge to apply more pressure on China, Pyongyang's economic lifeline, to rein in its volatile neighbor.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would be willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the U.S. to start a conversation. The two nations have no diplomatic relations.
The North Korean officials declined to discuss whether Mr. Kim would speak to Mr. Trump if the billionaire businessman is elected president. But they expressed skepticism that Mr. Trump would engage in dialogue.
""[President Barack] Obama also said before taking office that he would shake hands with enemy states. This is only for show, for electoral purposes,"" said one official.
During campaigning, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has emphasized continued coordination with U.S. allies such as South Korea and Japan to pressure North Korea diplomatically and economically.
As Secretary of State under Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton had a leading role in a 2012 deal with North Korea to provide aid in return for a freeze on its nuclear-weapons program. That agreement quickly collapsed when North Korea announced plans to launch a rocket using banned missile technology.
Mrs. Clinton subsequently used the phrase ""strategic patience"" to describe a policy of trying to pressure North Korea return to nuclear talks.
""We have no trust, no expectations for Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton,"" the North Korean official said. He added that the strategic-patience policy had allowed North Korea to develop its nuclear deterrent.
North Korea held its fourth nuclear bomb test in January, followed by a long-range rocket launch a month later that was condemned by many nations as a test of ballistic missile technology. The United Nations, the U.S. and other countries then introduced new sanctions against North Korea.
A second North Korean official said that comments from the presidential candidates backing pressure on North Korea were misguided.
""My country will never kneel down to whatever strong sanctions may be imposed on us,"" he said during general discussion at the conference.
North Korean officials will also attend a security conference in Beijing starting Tuesday, according to people familiar with the event. U.S. Special Representative for North Korea policy Sung Kim will join the meeting but has no plans for direct talks with the North Korean delegation, according to the State Department.

She had announced she was pregnant with her second child in December.
Aidan is the little brother of Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, who will be two years old in September.
Mrs. Clinton often talks about being a grandmother on the campaign trail, mentioning how she sings to Charlotte. Chelsea Clinton, 36, told People Magazine last year that her mother had also baby-sat for Charlotte.
In a statement from former President Bill Clinton's office, he and Mrs. Clinton said: ""We are all over the moon as Chelsea and Marc welcome Charlotte's little brother to the world and grateful for our many blessings.

Donald Trump Says He Would Be Greater Supporter of Gay Community Than Hillary Clinton; Presumptive Republican presidential nominee reiterates he will defend Second Amendment rights,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797633897?accountid=12768,"THE WOODLANDS, Texas--Donald Trump on Friday again asserted that he would be a better advocate for the gay community as president than Hillary Clinton after this week's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., that killed 49 people.
Mr. Trump called out a supporter holding a ""Gays for Trump"" sign in the crowd during a rally in this suburb north of Houston, drawing cheers from thousands of people who came to see him. Such comments in rallies and on Twitter have unnerved evangelical supporters who oppose gay marriage.
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee also invoked a common refrain of gun control opponents in asking the crowd what would have happened if people inside the Orlando nightclub--""those wonderful people""--had been armed.
Bullets could have gone ""in the opposite direction, right smack between the eyes of this maniac,"" he said, later calling the shooter a ""son of a bitch."" Mr. Trump's assurance that he would protect the Second Amendment, which protects Americans' right to keep and bear arms, drew some of the biggest cheers of the night.
Mr. Trump completed his swing through Texas by shrugging off criticism from some within his party over his opposition to free trade and assuring the crowd that he would appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court.
""The party is actually liking me,"" he said. ""You know, I'm an outsider, and historically, they don't like outsiders.""
He celebrated the first anniversary of his candidacy with rallies and fundraisers in San Antonio, Dallas and Houston. Friday afternoon, he met with donors at the home of Tony Buzbee, a trial lawyer who has supported Democratic and Republican candidates, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.
While Texas has been a reliably Republican state for two decades, rallies by the party's nominees have been extremely rare as many have eschewed public events here, holding private fundraisers instead.
The New York real-estate magnate also said he was actively courting supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has declined to withdraw from the Democratic race for president after Mrs. Clinton secured the delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
""We agree with Bernie on one thing, trade,"" Mr. Trump said, even as the crowd booed. ""We're trying to get Bernie's people, because a lot of those people hate Hillary.""

Trump and Clinton Show Strength in New York Poll,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780137090?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton hold double-digit leads in New York and are poised to regain their footing in their home state's primaries next Tuesday, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds.
On the Republican side, Mr. Trump holds a 33-point lead over his closest rival, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, 54% to 21%, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz trails both, as the top pick of 18% of likely Republican primary voters.
Mrs. Clinton maintains a 14-point lead in the Democratic contest, outpacing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 55% to 41% among likely Democratic primary voters. The former secretary of state's lead is built on strength among women, African-Americans and Democrats age 45 and older.
The survey results will be welcome news to the two front-runners, who have both lost ground in recent weeks. Mr. Trump is looking to bounce back from a decisive loss in last week's Wisconsin primary, while Mrs. Clinton has lost eight of the last nine Democratic contests.
""Right now, the front-runners look like they will erase recent setbacks and add significantly to their delegate margins,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey. ""New York is not likely to enhance the hopes of those trying to close the gap in the delegate hunt.""
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump remain the clear leaders in their parties nominating contests. Mrs. Clinton has a particularly strong advantage because of her support from her party's so-called superdelegates, the elected officials and other party leaders who have a say in determining the presidential nominee.
Mr. Trump is in a tougher spot because he is in a race to collect the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the nomination before the party gathers in Cleveland to determine the nominee. He has so far won 743. A big win in New York would help him reset his campaign narrative, after he surrendered delegates to the Cruz camp at a string of recent state party conventions.
On Monday, Mr. Trump, prompted by the result of the Colorado contest in which Mr. Cruz won all 34 delegates, complained that the GOP delegate-selection process, which differs from one state to the next, was established by party bigwigs to prevent political outsiders like him from winning the nomination. ""The system is rigged, it's crooked,"" he said in an interview on Fox News.
At the same time, he acknowledged that two of his children won't be able to vote in the New York primary because they missed the registration deadline. ""They feel very, very guilty,"" he said.
The Republican contest in New York, like the Democratic race, is limited to voters who have registered with the party.
Mr. Trump leads his two remaining rivals by at least a two-to-one margin among just about every demographic group in the New York electorate, among them women, college graduates and those primary voters who practice a religion -- three groups with which he often struggles.
New York will award 95 Republican delegates next Tuesday. A candidate can win all of the delegates from any given congressional district if he eclipses the 50% mark.
Mr. Cruz entered the New York contest riding high, following his convincing win in Wisconsin last week. But he is struggling to get a foothold in the Empire State, a difficulty attributed in part to his attack on what he called Mr. Trump's ""New York values"" earlier in the primary cycle. The senator defended those remarks last week, telling reporters he was referring to the ""values of liberal Democratic politicians.""
Mr. Cruz spent Monday on the West coast, attending campaign events in California, the last stop on the primary calendar where the remaining contenders will fight over the state's 172 delegates. Mr. Trump can't wrap up the nomination before California and four other states vote June 7.
""I'm going to say a sentence that hasn't been said for 50 years,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""California is going to decide the Republican nomination.""
At the same stop, the Texas senator taunted Mr. Trump for complaining about the delegate-selection process. ""When people vote against him, they are stealing the election,"" Mr. Cruz said.
In the latest poll, New York Republicans were also asked about the biggest question hanging over the GOP contest: What should happen if no candidate enters the convention this summer with a majority of delegates, the threshold for clinching the nomination.
A large majority -- 64% -- thinks Mr. Trump should win the nomination if he has the most delegates, even if he falls short of a majority, the poll found.
If Mr. Trump doesn't win the nomination, most primary voters also said they would oppose any effort to crown someone who didn't run for president this year, throwing cold water on speculation that party leaders should nominate House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) or some other Republican who sidestepped the primary. Some 59% said the nominee should be someone who ran in the primaries, while 32% said it would be acceptable to have a nominee who didn't.
The Democratic primary in New York is showing voting patterns familiar from prior contests, with independents, liberals and younger voters lining up behind Mr. Sanders, and Mrs. Clinton dominating among self-described Democrats and other traditional constituencies. Mrs. Clinton, who was twice elected to represent the state in the U.S. Senate, has a big advantage in New York City and the surrounding suburbs, while the race is effectively deadlocked upstate.
In what could be troubling trends for Mrs. Clinton in the general election, Mr. Sanders owns a slight lead among Latino Democrats, and his supporters are far less likely to back Mrs. Clinton in November than her backers are to support him. Some 30% of Sanders supporters said they wouldn't support Mrs. Clinton if their candidate doesn't win the nomination. By contrast, 15% of Clinton supporters said they wouldn't back Mr. Sanders should he become the nominee.
The two Democratic candidates are fighting over 247 delegates in New York.
The Journal/NBC News/Marist survey of New York, conducted April 6-10, included 259 likely Republican primary voters and 557 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 6.1 percentage points among GOP voters and 4.2 points among Democrats.

Election 2016: Clinton Plays Up Endorsements --- Ex-New York senator counters 2016 trend by showcasing support of state's elected officials,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780086550?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- Hillary Clinton heads into next week's presidential primary with the heavy backing of New York's Democratic establishment, a collection of support she has dispatched to assist her campaign from Manhattan to the far-reaching corners of the state.
The strategy challenges the notion that showcasing official endorsements wouldn't help much in an election year swept by enthusiasm for outsider candidates. Just as Ted Cruz tapped into Wisconsin's Republican establishment to help defeat Donald Trump in that state's primary April 5, Mrs. Clinton is betting her deep connections to Democratic officials here will help her win by a significant margin.
Mrs. Clinton, who served as a senator from New York for eight years before she was secretary of state, has amassed a list of more than 60 endorsements from Democratic public officials. Those range from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who backed her within hours of the declaration of her candidacy last April, to Long Island town supervisors.
For Mrs. Clinton, who has a big lead in polls ahead of the April 19 primary, even casual campaign stops are accompanied by elected officials. On Monday, U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley sat with her at a Bangladeshi-Pakistani restaurant in Jackson Heights in Queens, where he recalled her having campaigned for Senate. On Saturday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and others joined Mrs. Clinton at famed Junior's Restaurant in Brooklyn.
Bernie Sanders, by contrast, has picked up support from a small handful of mainly state and local officials. The Vermont senator also has enlisted celebrities, including actors Rosario Dawson, Susan Sarandon and Mark Ruffalo and, in recent days, Michael Stipe, formerly of the band R.E.M.
At an Albany rally on Monday, Mr. Sanders was introduced by Bill Perkins, a state senator.
""I appreciate Bill's support because this campaign not too surprisingly is not getting a whole lot of support from elected officials,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""We are taking on the establishment, and every now and then there is a brave man and woman who is elected who is prepared to do the right thing.""
Mrs. Clinton's backers have rebuffed those suggestions with praise for the former senator and ever-more-intimate tales of early personal encounters with her.
U.S. Rep. Paul Tonko recounted speaking with Mrs. Clinton during a ""listening tour"" she undertook when running for Senate. Albany City Council President Carolyn McLaughlin recalled when her mother pushed her out of the way at an Albany County Democratic picnic to shake then-Sen. Clinton's hand.
And former Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings recounted how, when the Clintons came to town for a pair of Bill Clinton campaign events in 1992, he told the then-Democratic candidate: ""There's only one person who can beat you: Your wife.""
New York political consultant Hank Sheinkopf, a Democrat who is unaffiliated with either campaign, called New York ""Clinton country"" and predicted she would win. But he questioned whether the institutional support would translate into votes.
""The issue here for Secretary Clinton is that generally more ideological voters turn out in primaries,"" he added.
And Mrs. Clinton's institutional backing hasn't come without its own complications during the run-up to the vote.
Mr. Sanders's supporters -- and Mr. Sanders himself -- have criticized Mrs. Clinton for appearing with Mr. Cuomo at a rally to support the new law for a $15 minimum wage in parts of the state when Mrs. Clinton doesn't support that wage floor on the federal level.
And last week, when Mrs. Clinton praised Mr. Cuomo during a speech to the New York State United Teachers, a union that has feuded with the governor, those remarks were met with forceful booing.
While Mrs. Clinton's support from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, with whom she appeared onstage at a black-tie dinner Saturday night in Manhattan, could help the candidate on the left, ""de Blasio might alienate moderate Democrats,"" said Doug Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College in Manhattan.
At a Sanders rally in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn last week, Nick Rizzo, the Democratic district leader, said he thinks Mr. Sanders has a great ground game in Brooklyn -- but that institutional support would help Mrs. Clinton, ""particularly in a close primary.""
Mr. Rizzo said he believes many politicians side with Mr. Sanders but can't endorse him in New York. Pointing to New York City Council member Rafael Espinal, who was at the event, he added: ""It's not a coincidence that the only other elected official in Brooklyn here supporting Bernie has arm tattoos and a beard.""

"Election 2016: Trump, Clintons Strictly Business",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780441376?accountid=12768,"One of the provocative questions in the 2016 presidential race is what dealings Donald Trump and the Clintons had over the years. Were they friends, allies or rivals as Mr. Trump built his fortune and Hillary and Bill Clinton pursued their political ambitions?
On Tuesday, the Clinton Presidential Library released about 500 pages of material dating from Mr. Clinton's presidency that offer a few insights into how the Clinton White House saw the business mogul, now the leading Republican presidential candidate.
The documents, released in response to a public-records request, provide little evidence of a personal relationship, showing only that the White House had a passing interest in Mr. Trump's business deals and his earlier flirtation with a White House bid.
The records include logs of White House holiday cards sent to Mr. Trump, an autographed copy of Mr. Trump's book ""The Art of the Deal"" and news clippings about the businessman's contemplation of a presidential campaign in 1999.
Emails from Betty Currie, Mr. Clinton's personal secretary at the White House, show a brief internal discussion about whether to send birthday greetings to Mr. Trump.
""What are [your] thoughts on sending a birthday letter to Donald Trump -- who turns 50 on June 14,"" Ms. Currie wrote in a June 1996 email to another White House staffer. ""Please forward response to Maureen Lewis who will prepare letter -- if you approve. Thanks.""
A few days later, that plan apparently was scrapped. ""Cancel letter to Donald Trump,"" Ms. Currie wrote.
At the White House, Mr. Clinton's aides followed speculation that Mr. Trump might run for president and made sure he was properly briefed on the matter before interviews. The tone of the briefing materials suggests Mr. Trump was seen as less a credible potential candidate than a curiosity.
In a memo to Mr. Clinton before a planned TV interview with Bryant Gumbel, aides included a sample question-and-answer involving the political ambitions of Mr. Trump and a few other celebrities.
""This year we've been treated to news that Donald Trump, Cybil Shepherd, Jesse Ventura and Warren Beatty might run for president,"" the sample question read. ""Is this the result of a demeaning of the office that you've contributed to?""
In a suggested answer, the aides wrote, ""I don't think what I've done has anything to do with such political developments. We go through all sorts of cycles in politics, and we're in one now where some people from the entertainment world are talking about running for president . . ."" When the interview took place, Mr. Gumbel didn't ask about Mr. Trump.
A White House diary entry in 2000 records that Mr. Clinton posed for a photo with the businessman at Trump Tower in New York. Another file details invitations sent to Mr. Trump for White House events.
The records include an assortment of news articles and memos that make mention of Mr. Trump, a few of his real estate deals and interviews he gave in 1999 about a potential presidential campaign.

Election 2016: Black Women Prove Vital For Clinton --- African-American officeholders and voters help propel candidate's campaign,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785139503?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton never goes very far without black women sharing the stage, introducing her around or casting ballots for her in outsize numbers -- and they are a prime reason she stands on the cusp of claiming the Democratic presidential nomination.
Black women have long played a big role in Mrs. Clinton's life and career, and now their expanding roles in politics -- as voters, officeholders and activists -- have lifted the Clinton campaign in multiple ways.
Exit polls show turnout by black women in Democratic primaries is significantly higher than turnout by black men, in several cases more than double. And black women have overwhelmingly supported the former senator and secretary of state over rival Bernie Sanders, with 90% or more of them voting for her in some states. In New York, she took 79% of their votes on her way to an easy victory, the exit polls show.
Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has repeatedly tried to make inroads with black voters, without much success. Mr. Sanders's best showing so far with black women came in Missouri, but Mrs. Clinton still took 70%, according to the exit polls.
Ahead of the New York primary this month, Rep. Yvette Clarke, a black woman who represents Brooklyn, was constantly at her side. In Ohio, she frequently shared the stage with Rep. Marcia Fudge of Cleveland.
""Black women really are the backbone of the Democratic Party,"" Ms. Fudge said in an interview.
Winning with African-American voters carries outsize importance because of Democratic Party rules that the Clinton campaign grasped early on. Delegates to the national convention are allocated by congressional district, and districts that have historically turned out more Democratic votes get more delegates.
The result: Districts with large black populations have many more delegates than others.
Take Ms. Fudge's northeast Ohio district. Typically, congressional districts each get between four and eight delegates, but hers had 17, more than any other in the nation. Eleven of them went to Mrs. Clinton.
Black women have long registered and voted at higher rates than their male counterparts, but in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, they surpassed all other racial and ethnic groups in their turnout rates.
It isn't just an Obama effect, said Maya Harris, who studied the subject at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and who now works for the Clinton campaign. She pointed to the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial race, when high turnout rates among black women helped elect Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who took 38% of white women but a whopping 91% of black women.
At the same time, more black women are being elected to office. There are 20 black women in the House, including two nonvoting members, many of whom have campaigned with Mrs. Clinton. Four black women are big-city mayors. And black women have increased their representation in state legislatures by nearly 50% since 1994, according to a study by the Center for American Women& Politics at Rutgers University.
Black women also are the driving force behind activist groups that hold particular sway in the Democratic Party, such as Black Lives Matter and Mothers of the Movement, made up of women who have lost children to gun violence or in police custody.
""We decided to support Hillary, because she supported us,"" said Nicole Paultre-Bell, whose fiance, Sean Bell, was killed in a police encounter hours before their wedding.
That support has withstood anger among some African-American activists about her support for the 1994 crime bill, which her husband signed into law. At a fundraiser earlier this year, a black woman unveiled a banner quoting a speech she gave as first lady, when she referred to violent criminals as ""superpredators"" and said, ""we have to bring them to heel."" After that, Mrs. Clinton said that that she shouldn't have used that language.
In interviews, many black voters and leaders said they relate to Mrs. Clinton's long, bumpy career, including the public airing of her husband's extramarital affairs. ""She has taken a beating for many things publicly, and she's still standing. And we feel the same way,"" Ms. Fudge said.
""There was no barrier when you first met her,"" said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Texas). ""We see her as a fellow sister.""
Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department, 2008 campaign manager and her first boss after law school have all been black women. She has counted many well-known black women as friends, such as the late Dorothy Height, a civil rights and women's rights activist.
Still, if she wins the Democratic nomination, the question remains whether she will be able to motivate black women, and men, to go to the polls in November in the same numbers that Mr. Obama did.
Interviews with black women in many of the states that have voted so far suggest she is making the sale. ""There's something in her character,"" said Loreatha Jones of Brooklyn, who is retired. ""I feel that she speaks for me. She speaks to me and she speaks about me, which most people can't.""

"Election 2016: Trump Wouldn't Pull In Democrats, Says Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785964300?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton flatly dismissed Donald Trump's suggestion that he can win over supporters of rival Bernie Sanders in the fall election, arguing that the Republican's views on a range of issues would repel them.
In an interview Friday with CNN, Mrs. Clinton also said she wouldn't back down from her focus on women's issues, and professed little concern about Mr. Trump's assertion that she wouldn't win 5% of the vote if she weren't a woman.
""If playing the 'women's card' means standing up for the concerns that women have and that they express to me, then deal me in,"" she said, using what has become a signature phrase for her campaign. ""Because that's exactly what I've always done for decades [and] what I will do in this campaign.""
She also cited her two successful elections to the U.S. Senate and the many votes she has received in the 2008 and 2016 presidential elections. ""So it doesn't really square with reality,"" she said. His attacks are ""kind of silly,"" she said, saying she is more bothered by his attacks on other groups.
Mr. Trump set off the latest back-and-forth on Tuesday after both he and Mrs. Clinton had strong showings in the East Coast primaries. ""Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5% of the vote. The only thing she's got going is the woman's card,"" he said. That prompted days of mocking by the Clinton campaign and its supporters.
Mr. Trump stuck with the attack, saying that Mrs. Clinton couldn't run for ""city council"" without the ""woman's card.""
Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders share some views -- such as opposition to free-trade agreements -- and have both challenged their respective political establishments. Mr. Trump has suggested that he could win over some of the Sanders backers if Mr. Sanders loses the Democratic nomination.
Mrs. Clinton dismissed that idea. She cited climate change, the minimum wage and equitable pay for women as issues where Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are at odds and called the Republican front-runner's foreign policy views ""reckless, loose, dangerous.""
""I don't think that's very appealing"" to Sanders backers, she said. ""I'm going to be very aggressive in . . . reaching out to Sen. Sanders's supporters, but we have so much more in common. And we have far more in common than they do with Donald Trump or any Republican.""
Asked about insults that Mr. Trump had delivered to her, Mrs. Clinton said in the CNN interview, ""I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak."" An aide said she was referring to past GOP opponents. ""I'm not going to deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me,"" she said.
After his losses on Tuesday in four out of five states, Mr. Sanders, who trails in the race for convention delegates, suggested he was staying in the contest in hopes of influencing the Democratic Party's platform on key issues. Mrs. Clinton suggested to CNN that there may be room for discussion.
""We're gonna talk. We're gonna work together. Because, look, we want the same goals,"" she said. ""We really are going to be unified and have a tremendous progressive agenda to run on in the fall. And I really think that will help us win the election and it will also help us govern.""

"Election 2016: Clinton, Cruz Rake In Campaign Donations",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782388903?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Ted Cruz and their allies have millions of dollars on hand and are in the strongest financial positions in their respective parties as they head into the primary season's final stretch, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, donations to the super PAC backing Gov. John Kasich sagged and his campaign saw just a small fundraising bump following his win last month in his home state of Ohio.
A super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA Action, raised $11.7 million last month -- more than double its February haul -- and had $44.6 million left to spend at the end of March, according to its FEC filing.
The PAC's haul will supplement strong fundraising by Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which ended March with $29 million in the bank. Mrs. Clinton had been outraised in March by rival Bernie Sanders -- bringing in $29.3 million to the Vermont senator's $46 million -- but spent her funds at a slower rate. Mr. Sanders churned through his cash in March, and ended the month with $17 million in the bank.
Campaigns and super PACs were required to disclose their March fundraising to the FEC by midnight on Wednesday.
Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, had $8.8 million in the bank at the end of March. He raised $12.5 million during the month.
GOP front-runner Donald Trump loaned his campaign another $11.5 million last month -- bringing his total loans to more than $36 million -- and raised another $2.7 million from outside donors. While his cash-on-hand figure, at $2.1 million, was barely higher than Mr. Kasich's, Mr. Trump has said he is willing to spend uncapped amounts on the campaign.
Mr. Cruz is also backed by a growing network of super PACs that raised at least $10 million last month and had more than $21 million left to spend. The super PAC backing Mr. Trump, which launched a $1 million ad campaign on his behalf last month, had not yet filed with the FEC.
Super PACs can raise money without contribution caps but are barred from coordinating with or donating to campaigns.
Trusted Leadership PAC, a super PAC in the network of pro-Cruz groups, saidWednesdaythat it raised $4.5 million in March. Trusted Leadership PAC's biggest donors last month were Stan Herzog, chief executive of Missouri-based Herzog Contracting Corp., and Richard Uihlein, owner of a Wisconsin-based shipping company.

Clinton Chugs On With Easy Victory,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782116402?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton decisively won her home-state New York primary Tuesday, shutting down one of the few remaining chances for rival Bernie Sanders to slow her march to the Democratic presidential nomination.
Mr. Sanders had pointed to New York, where he was born, as a place where he could take a bite out of Mrs. Clinton's formidable lead in convention delegates. He campaigned hard in what became a sharp-edged fight for the state, delivering his call for a political revolution to thousands of people who crowded a series of outdoor rallies.
But Mrs. Clinton, who represented the state for eight years in the Senate, racked up impressive vote totals in New York City, with its diverse electorate, and in its populous suburban counties. Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, performed better upstate.
""The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight!"" Mrs. Clinton told cheering supporters Tuesday in New York City, appearing on stage with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who campaigned heavily on her behalf.
She focused sharply on the general election ahead, said almost nothing critical of Mr. Sanders and began what may be a long process of unifying the party around her. ""To all the people who supported Sen. Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us,"" she said.
Speaking ahead of the results Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanders conceded nothing, telling a crowd at Penn State University that his campaign was challenging the notion that change is not possible and ""this is the way it always will be.""
Mr. Sanders also took several now-familiar shots at Mrs. Clinton, and earlier in the day, aides said his recent sharp tone wasn't likely to change even with a New York loss. But if Mrs. Clinton backs off him, they said, he may do the same.
The delegate math is steeply against Mr. Sanders. He came into the New York contest having won eight of the past nine contests and drawing tens of thousands of people to his rallies. But his delegate gain from those mostly small-state victories was modest.
Heading into New York's voting, Mrs. Clinton had an advantage of 244 pledged delegates, the type chosen by voters, according to preliminary Associated Press tallies.
Overall, she had 1,289 pledged delegates, and when you include superdelegates -- party leaders who can support anyone -- supporting her, Mrs. Clinton's total jumped to 1,758 to his 1,076. A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to claim the nomination.
Mrs. Clinton has won most of the large, diverse states, and the Vermont senator's recent wins have done little to cut into a yawning delegate deficit. Now just three large states remain on the Democratic calendar -- Pennsylvania next week, and California and New Jersey in June.
The victory was a relief for Mrs. Clinton, who campaigned hard to avoid what would have been an embarrassing loss, even one that may not have prevented her from winning the nomination.
Mr. Sanders faced tough odds from the outset, in part because the state has a large proportion of nonwhite voters, who have generally favored Mrs. Clinton. In addition, New York barred independents, who have been friendly to Mr. Sanders, from voting in party primaries, and it required voters who wanted to switch party affiliation to do so six months ago.
But ahead of the results, top Sanders advisers said the senator had no plans to take the pressure off his Democratic rival as long as she keeps up her critiques of the Vermont senator.
""We have received a lot of innuendo and dismissiveness and demeaning comments from the Clinton campaign -- from the secretary herself and from her surrogates,"" Jane Sanders, the candidate's wife and a close adviser, said in an interview. ""He's not going to sit by and just not respond.""
Clinton advisers are hoping the New York victory will allow the former secretary of state to turn her attention to the fall contest. For many weeks, Mrs. Clinton has taken shots at her GOP opponents, but Mr. Sanders's strength has forced her to keep much of her focus on the primary.
""You have to unify the party, and you don't want to prematurely look past someone who has earned a lot of votes and put up a strong fight,"" one senior adviser said. ""The timing is everything.""
During the campaign for New York, the Vermont senator ramped up his attacks on his rival. He aired a TV ad contrasting his rival's high-paid Wall Street speeches with her opposition to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. (Mrs. Clinton supports a $12 federal floor.)
Mr. Sanders also said her positions made her unqualified for the presidency, though he quickly backed away from that assertion.
Mrs. Clinton also was tough, particularly on the issue of gun restrictions, suggesting Mr. Sanders isn't being truthful about his record and accusing him of personally blocking a lawsuit by families of children killed in the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Conn.
Sanders senior adviser Tad Devine said Mrs. Clinton and her supporters have the power to change the tenor of the race. ""If the Clinton campaign stops their attacks, that will go a long way to changing the tone,"" he said after the race was called.
Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said Tuesday night that in light of Mrs. Clinton's dominant position, Mr. Sanders ""has to decide if he's going to stay on this destructive path where he's making personal character attacks. . . Or will he return to running the campaign on issues?""
One Sanders adviser said that even if the senator doesn't win the nomination, he hopes that picking up as many delegates as possible would give him leverage to press his agenda at the convention.
""Does Bernie think he can win? He thinks he can win, yes -- and he [also] is trying to get delegates to push his issues,"" said Larry Cohen, a longtime labor leader and a Sanders adviser.

Berning the Clinton Establishment,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783209839?accountid=12768,"Hail and farewell, Bernie.
The Vermont senator isn't yet mathematically boxed out of the Democratic nomination, but near enough for government work. Hillary Clinton's victory Tuesday in New York has her confident enough of winning the prize that she's now pivoting to the general election. Mr. Sanders felt the need to issue a memo insisting he can still win -- so even he knows that he has a problem. Barring an intervention by God, or the FBI, Hillary wins.
Perhaps rightly, considering voter sentiment and party prospects. Mrs. Clinton has won more states, more votes, and more pledged delegates. And she's likely the better general-election candidate: a tough campaigner, stronger across varied demographics, who has won six of the nine crucial swing states and isn't a self-declared socialist. Mr. Sanders's vow to go all the way to Philly, and to try to use superdelegates to overturn these results, increasingly risks looking like sour grapes.
And yet Mrs. Clinton is still the loser. This has been, from the start, the Bernie Sanders show. Hillary came into the race determined to rev up the old Clinton machine, to revive the Clinton era, to burnish the long Clinton legacy. Instead, Mr. Sanders has forced her to betray it. He provided the sword, and she has slain the Clinton Democrats.
A few months in politics feels like ages, but it wasn't so long ago that the knock on Hillary Clinton's campaign was that it was content free. She spent months on the road, ""listening,"" refusing to state her views. The cipher expected coronation, and was intent on preserving maximum flexibility for the general election. Mr. Sanders blew up that strategy.
As he surged, Hillary had to do far more than come clean. She had to abandon every winning, centrist, New Democrat position that had defined the Clinton years. Bill Clinton left office with the highest approval rating of any president since World War II. Mrs. Clinton has spent the past six months in essence saying that everything he did was weak, phony or wrong.
Bill's was the party of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Hillary's is the party that opposes even a Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by the union-rolled Obama administration. Mrs. Clinton protests that she still supports trade but objects to the specifics of TPP. Does anyone envision a new President Clinton recrafting the deal?
Bill's was the party that increased permits for oil and gas drilling by more than 50% -- even as it hailed the Kyoto Protocol. Hillary's is the party that now opposes the Keystone XL pipeline, opposes offshore drilling, and even opposes one of the country's greatest economic engines -- fracking. ""By the time we get through all of my conditions,"" she promised in March, ""I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place."" Climate isn't simply the left's new religion, but core unfinished business for the White House, and Mrs. Clinton would make it a hallmark of her presidency.
Hillary Clinton has no time for Bill's old plans for Social Security reform; she'd expand the program to provide bigger payouts to women and widows. She's over his $5.15 federal minimum wage and in a bidding war with Mr. Sanders that begins, but doesn't end, at $15 an hour. She's for debt-free college, mandatory family leave, and $1 trillion in new spending for infrastructure, education and solar panels. The era of big government is so back. Bill Clinton might charge political manslaughter, at the hands of his wife, at the direction of Mr. Sanders.
And Hillary's switcheroos have also come at a price to the Clinton brand. The Sanders purists see her lurches left as false, and another reason not to trust her. Especially when they are combined with Mr. Sanders's relentless criticism of her money-grubbing and Wall Street ties. He has taken heat for ignoring her FBI scandal, probably because he was worried of being accused of stoking what Mrs. Clinton claims is a right-wing plot. Instead he shrewdly went at her ethics via topics that wind up his base: cozy ties with corporations, dark money, lobbyists. Even Mrs. Clinton's new vitriol against American business (another change) hasn't helped deflect the charges.
Mrs. Clinton's disapproval ratings -- 56% of Americans hold a negative view of her in the recent WSJ poll -- can't be blamed on Republicans, who've largely been too busy beating up one another to go after her. They are a function of the Vermonter. And they translate into depressed enthusiasm. As the stats master Michael Barone wrote this week, in 16 of the 21 primaries so far, Hillary has ""received fewer votes than in 2008, or fewer votes than Obama got when he beat her."" That's worrisome news for a woman hoping to reassemble the Obama coalition for victory in November.
A lot of that dynamic will come down to the caliber of Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent. The nomination is hers for the taking. But the winner -- politically -- in this season of Democratic distress is the man who Berned up the Clinton establishment.

Clinton's Negative Majority,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782070455?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton won New York's primary Tuesday, which means that barring an act of God or FBI director Jim Comey -- they aren't the same -- she will be the Democratic nominee for President. So Democrats should be alarmed by the former first lady's rising unpopularity.
The latest evidence comes in the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken April 10-14. A regular feature of this survey asks voters about their ""feelings toward"" certain individuals or institutions -- whether they are very positive, somewhat positive, neutral, somewhat negative or very negative. In April the poll found Mrs. Clinton hitting a dubious new record of 56% who have somewhat or very negative feelings toward her. Only 32% have a positive view.
As striking is the negative trend over the last three years. In Jan. 2013, not long after she left President Obama's cabinet, her net negative was 25%. As the nearby chart shows, her unpopularity has since climbed with only occasional exceptions (See accompanying chart -- WSJ April 20, 2016). She broke through negative 40% in the middle of last year, and she hit negative 50% in February. In April a remarkable 42% had a very negative view of the woman Democrats are counting on to hold the White House.
Some of this is explainable by the pounding any candidate takes during a campaign. Bernie Sanders has been portraying Mrs. Clinton as a tool of the big banks, even if he's ducked her serious ethical problems. But what should worry Democrats is that Bill Clinton's wife has been a national political figure since 1992, and her political identity is well known and will be hard to change.
All of which means Republicans should be poised to retake the White House in November if they nominate someone remotely tolerable. Yet they may not. Donald Trump reinforced his GOP front-runner status Tuesday with a blowout victory in his home state of New York, but his negative rating in the WSJ/NBC survey is an astounding 65%. Ted Cruz is disliked by 49%, though he's less well known, with 21% having a neutral view. The Texan finished a distant third in New York to John Kasich.
Hard to believe, but Messrs. Trump and Cruz may be the only two Republicans who could lose to Hillary Clinton.",2016-06-28
Election 2016: Clinton Pivots Toward Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783656184?accountid=12768,"JENKINTOWN, Pa. -- Hillary Clinton has yet to secure the delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, but the front-runner is increasingly turning to the themes likely to dominate a potential general election campaign against Donald Trump.
In a campaign swing across Pennsylvaniaon Friday, Mrs. Clinton trained her fire not on her Democratic opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is trailing in the delegate count and facing an uphill battle, but on Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner who remains her most likely opponent in November.
Mrs. Clinton positioned herself as the candidate best able to stand up to defend the groups of Americans that Mr. Trump has frequently singled out in his speeches -- previewing a line of attack that her campaign is sure to use if Mr. Trump becomes the Republican nominee.
""I'm not going to respond to what he said about me. I'm going to respond to what he has said about women in general. I'm going to respond to what he has said about immigrants. I'm going to respond to what he has said about Muslims. I'm going to respond on behalf of all the people who have been the target of his hatred and his demagoguery,"" said Mrs. Clinton at a restaurant here in Jenkintown.
Mrs. Clinton was referring to Mr. Trump's proposal to bar Muslims temporarily from entering the U.S., his comparison of illegal immigrants to rapists and a string of past comments about prominent women.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has increasingly professionalized his small campaign operation, bringing on board a veteran GOP operative and stepping up his outreach to party regulars. Despite an off-the-cuff oratory style that has propelled him to the top of the Republican primary field, he has said that he will add teleprompters and a speechwriter to his staff to give him more message discipline going forward.
Mr. Trump, speaking to Fox News in an interview scheduled to air on Saturday, appeared prepared for Mrs. Clinton's attacks -- previewing his own general-election case against her by giving her the moniker ""Crooked Hillary.""
""The only thing she's got going is the women card,"" he said. ""Without the women card, she's got nothing going, and she's gonna play it to the hilt, and I'm gonna be talking about things, and one of the things I talk about is, we call her Crooked Hillary because she's a crooked person -- she's always been a crooked person,"" he said in the interview.
Mrs. Clinton has been dogged by the revelation that she exclusively used a personal email server while serving as secretary of state, which wasn't illegal, but was discouraged by the government. She has also been attacked by Mr. Sanders for taking large speaking fees from major banks and corporations, and her family foundation's ties to business and foreign governments have drawn Republican criticism.
Female voters were paramount during Mrs. Clinton's stop in Jenkins, where she convened a roundtable discussion with more than two dozen women to discuss everything from equal pay to gun control. The stop included an appearance with Lilly Ledbetter, the plaintiff in a landmark pay-discrimination case who later became an activist for equal pay between men and women. Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Ledbetter a ""heroine of the equal pay movement"" and invited her to address the crowd.
That Mrs. Clinton has chosen Pennsylvania to make an aggressive case against Mr. Trump comes as the state has emerged as a potential general-election battleground.
Mr. Trump's best path to the presidency might run through states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin -- Rust Belt states that have trended Democratic in recent years, but where Mr. Trump's advantages with blue-collar white voters might offset his high negatives among female and nonwhite voters. Mr. Trump and his supporters believe white, working-class voters can be mobilized to turn out in higher levels than they have in previous cycles.

Election 2016: Clinton Gets A New Keystone,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784024559?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton won the Pennsylvania primary eight years ago in part by appealing to white, working-class voters with stories of her family roots in blue-collar Scranton and her childhood experience with guns.
Polls suggest she will win the Keystone State again on Tuesday, this time with a far different coalition -- a shift that could have big implications for the general election, should she win her party's nomination.
Mrs. Clinton now enjoys far less support from rural and working-class white Democrats, a Wall Street Journal analysis of this year's primary results shows. Instead, she is dominant among minority voters and upscale, urban and suburban professionals -- voters who eight years ago largely rejected her for then-Sen. Barack Obama.
In essence, Mrs. Clinton has adopted Mr. Obama's political coalition. Her rival this year, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has taken over her leading position among rural, white voters and has claimed only one part of Mr. Obama's political base: young adults.
""There's been a kind of role-reversal, with Sanders winning the white, blue-collar workers -- people who earn under $50,000,"" said Terry Madonna, a professor of public affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.
That role reversal points to the strengths and weaknesses Mrs. Clinton would carry as her party's nominee.
With her new coalition of minority voters and generally upscale whites who live in metropolitan areas, Mrs. Clinton has a strong hand in cities and their diverse inner suburbs. Those are the battlegrounds in many key states.
Moreover, the groups now backing Mrs. Clinton are growing as a share of the population, whereas the share of working-class whites is shrinking. Nearly half of Mitt Romney's votes in 2012 came from working-class whites, but there weren't enough of them to push the GOP nominee to victory.
At the same time, Mrs. Clinton's standing among white voters, especially rural and working-class whites, has declined substantially. In November, that could pose a risk in states that are diversifying slowly.
In a Journal/NBC News survey this month, some 72% of white men said they had a negative image of Mrs. Clinton rather than a positive one. Some 64% of whites of both genders had a negative view of her, compared with 47% in 2008. Her image among rural voters has also declined.
Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who helps direct the Journal/NBC News poll, said he could imagine Mrs. Clinton losing white voters by margins big enough to ""put this race into play,"" if her unpopularity among whites was accompanied by a drop in voter turnout among the young and minority voters who boosted Mr. Obama.
Aides to GOP front-runner Donald Trump have played up his own appeal among working-class, white voters to argue that he could beat Mrs. Clinton in Rust Belt states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, although a recent Journal/NBC News/Marist poll undercuts that argument. In a survey of registered voters in Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton beats Mr. Trump by 15 percentage points in a hypothetical general-election matchup.
A look at which counties Mrs. Clinton won in her 2008 primary campaign, and which she has retained in this year's primary race, shows the magnitude of the change in her coalition.
Mrs. Clinton has won 349 rural, overwhelmingly white counties in states that have voted so far and for which data are available, a Journal analysis shows. In 2008, she had won 511 of those largely white counties in the same states -- some 162 more victories than this year.
While losing largely white counties, Mrs. Clinton has made big gains in cities and their adjacent suburbs. She has won 76 of these counties, a gain of 39 from 2008. Mrs. Clinton has also won more counties on the outer rim of metro areas than in 2008.

"Election 2016: Poll Finds Front-Runners Have Big Leads --- Trump, Clinton could boost their delegate counts Tuesday in Pennsylvania primary",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783848514?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton looked poised to build on their momentum-shifting wins in New York with victories in the Pennsylvania primaries Tuesday, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll shows.
Mr. Trump leads the Republican field in Pennsylvania as the top choice of 45% of likely GOP primary voters, the poll shows, outpacing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, with 27%, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 24%.
In the Democratic race, Mrs. Clinton leads Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 55%- 40%, among likely primary voters.
For Republicans, the statewide results in Pennsylvania -- one of five states voting Tuesday in New England and the Mid-Atlantic region -- could turn out to be more symbolic than binding. No matter which candidate wins Tuesday, 54 of the state's 71 delegates will be free to back whomever they choose at the party's national nominating convention in Cleveland this summer.
Since ballots won't list specific candidates next to contenders for these 54 convention delegate seats, Mr. Trump's website lists the names of 41 of them in 15 congressional districts it says would back him in July in Cleveland.
The Democratic contest in Pennsylvania is more straightforward, with 189 pledged delegates up for grabs. They will be divided based on the candidates' statewide performance and their finish in each of the state's 18 congressional districts.
""Trump and Clinton are both positioned to win the popular vote,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ""For Democrats, it's all about delegate counts. But, for Republicans, the popular vote doesn't guarantee a big chunk of the delegates at the convention.""
The survey results undercut Mr. Trump's argument in recent weeks that he can put Pennsylvania and other Rust Belt states in play in a general-election matchup this fall with Mrs. Clinton. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Mrs. Clinton beats Mr. Trump, 54% to 39%, the poll found. The margin is even wider in a contest between Messrs. Trump and Sanders.
Of the three Republicans who remain in the race, only Mr. Kasich leads the Democratic front-runner, Mrs. Clinton. He holds a narrow, 48% to 45% edge.
Mr. Trump's voters are more committed than those of his remaining rivals, with 72% of his backers saying they ""strongly support"" him. His support in the state is broad and is strongest among men, voters age 45 or older and those without a college degree.
As in many prior races, Mr. Trump's support is weaker among women, college graduates and voters who rate themselves ""very conservative,"" a group that Mr. Cruz carries.
The mostly moderate Philadelphia suburbs represent the most fertile terrain for Mr. Trump's rivals to try to pick off delegates. Mr. Trump is the preferred pick of 38% of likely primary voters in those communities outside Philadelphia, just four percentage-points better than Mr. Kasich, at 34%. A quarter of the suburban voters favor Mr. Cruz.
The poll shows Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator and secretary of state, garnering twice as much support from African-American voters as does Mr. Sanders. And she has big leads among women, self-identified Democrats and primary voters age 45 and older.
Mr. Sanders, for his part, has big leads among younger voters and the most liberal primary voters.

"Front-Runners March On --- Clinton Wins Four States, but Sanders Vows to Keep Fighting",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784403379?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton swept to four primary victories over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders Tuesday night in a showing that makes her the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee.
Mrs. Clinton's chief task now shifts from winning more states to unifying a fractured party and persuading supporters of Mr. Sanders to coalesce behind her. Her first step appeared to be turning down the rhetorical temperature, giving Mr. Sanders's supporters space to move in her direction.
Mrs. Clinton took Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut, the three largest prizes of the evening, as well as Delaware, while Mr. Sanders pulled off a win in Rhode Island.
Ahead of Tuesday's contests, Mrs. Clinton had already amassed a nearly insurmountable delegate lead. But so far, the Sanders campaign is showing little sign it is ready to step aside and make it easier for her to capture the nomination. The race has exposed deep fissures between Sanders and Clinton backers rooted in age, race and ideology, as Mr. Sanders built a passionate following among young, white, liberal voters.
A new poll shows Mr. Sanders is the most popular person in the race in either party among young voters. The Harvard Institute of Politics survey showed that among 18- to 29-year-olds, 54% viewed him positively, 31% negatively. Mrs. Clinton was the favorite of African-Americans, centrists and older Democrats.
One question facing Clinton allies is when they can become more direct in calling for Mr. Sanders to focus on party unity and concede he can't win the nomination.
Speaking to cheering supporters in Philadelphia, Mrs. Clinton stressed the goal of bringing the party together. ""We will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together,"" she said.
Mrs. Clinton offered her most direct outreach to date to Mr. Sanders's backers, saying she shares his priorities such as fighting inequality. ""Whether you support Sen. Sanders or support me, there's much more that unites us than divides us,"" Mrs. Clinton said.
Mr. Sanders said late Tuesday he was staying in the race, but suggested that he recognized his biggest impact might be in pushing the party's message to the left. ""This campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform,"" he said in a statement.
Polling suggests the party is becoming less unified, not more. In March, 78% of Democratic primary voters said they would be satisfied if Mrs. Clinton were the nominee. In April, that fell to 73%, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. Asked if they could see themselves supporting Mrs. Clinton for president, just 58% of Sanders primary voters said yes, with 40% saying no, according to the April poll.
This has led to some uneasiness among party leaders, who fear that scars from the hard-fought campaign could make it difficult to unify the party for the general election. As the race reaches the endgame, bitterness is evident from some rank-and-file Sanders voters.
At a polling place in Providence, R.I., Christine Kolasa, a retired mortgage-banking manager in her 60s, said she had voted for Mr. Sanders and would never vote for Mrs. Clinton in a general election.
The candidates came into Tuesday's contest with Mrs. Clinton leading in pledged delegates 1,428 to 1,153. With superdelegates -- party leaders who can support any candidate they choose -- added to the mix, her lead stood at a more formidable 1,946 to 1,192.
A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination. The five states that voted Tuesday have 384 delegates.
Mrs. Clinton entered the evening with an advantage of 275 pledged delegates. Preliminary results from the Associated Press showed she would push that lead above 350.
At a televised MSNBC town-hall event on the eve of the vote, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders said in separate appearances that it was the other one's job to unite the party behind Mrs. Clinton if she becomes the nominee.
The best way for her to mobilize his supporters, Mr. Sanders said, was for her to adopt pillars of his agenda, including a single-payer health-care system, a carbon tax and free tuition at public colleges. Mrs. Clinton has supported none of these ideas.
Mrs. Clinton bristled at the suggestion that to win over Mr. Sanders and his backers, she needs to adopt his agenda. Recalling her fight with Barack Obama in 2008, she said, ""We got to the end in June, and I did not put down conditions. I didn't say, 'You know what, if Sen. Obama does X, Y and Z, maybe I'll support him.' ""
Bickering between the Sanders and Clinton camps unfolded throughout Tuesday.
In a CNN interview, Mr. Sanders's wife, Jane Sanders, raised the issue of Mrs. Clinton's refusal to release transcripts of paid speeches she has given to Wall Street firms, while parrying calls for Mr. Sanders to release more of his tax returns.
Asked by CNN if she was linking the release of tax records to Mrs. Clinton's release of speech transcripts, Mrs. Sanders said, ""Yep.""
At the same time, a fundraising solicitation from the Sanders campaign used harsh language in describing Clinton campaign tactics. The letter says the campaign is trying to get Mr. Sanders to tone down his rhetoric and accusing him of aiding Republican front-runner Donald Trump.
The email, from Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, said the Clinton campaign, in describing Sanders campaign methods, has ""used language reserved for traitors to our country, saying we are 'giving aid and comfort' to Trump.""
While Mr. Sanders's path to winning the nomination is growing increasingly narrow by his own admission, staying in the race and continuing to attract money and support could strengthen his hand as he tries to push the Democratic message in a more progressive direction.
Democratic operatives said that whatever the current tensions, the party will unify in the face of a Republican opponent, especially one as polarizing as either of the two leading GOP candidates, Mr. Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz.
The Democrats' divisions, they added, are nothing compared to the splits in the GOP, with the top candidates calling each other names and threats of a chaotic Republican convention in Cleveland.
Should Mrs. Clinton win the nomination, Mr. Sanders will support her over the Republican nominee, his advisers say. The question is how ardent will he be in backing her.

Election 2016: Clinton Is Taking Fire From Two Rivals,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786757590?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is now fighting a two-front war for the presidency, facing an emboldened, combative Donald Trump while fending off Bernie Sanders, who promises to take his campaign all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July.
Mr. Trump, by contrast, has cleared the Republican field and can direct his firepower at Mrs. Clinton alone. He signaled Wednesday that he would pick up Mr. Sanders's line of attack against the Democratic front-runner.
""Bernie actually said she's unqualified because she's got bad judgment, and it's true,"" Mr. Trump told Time magazine.
Mrs. Clinton is also attacking Mr. Trump daily, and Wednesday she told CNN the U.S. can't afford to take a risk on a ""blustering, bullying guy.""
The landscape has shifted beneath Mrs. Clinton. For months, it seemed as if Republicans were headed for a messy, contested summer convention, while Democrats would unify behind the front-runner. Mr. Trump still faces an insurgency within his party, but Mrs. Clinton is the one with a persistent primary foe drawing support from a large chunk of the party.
Democrats say they are confident that the party will rally around Mrs. Clinton, partly in response to the prospect of a Trump presidency. Mrs. Clinton holds a nearly insurmountable delegate lead. She lost to Mr. Sanders on Tuesday in Indiana, but the victory cut Mrs. Clinton's lead by only six delegates.
Nonetheless, victory emboldened the Vermont senator, and he went after Mrs. Clinton directly at a rally Tuesday night. His aides said Wednesday that the aggressive posture would continue at least through the last primary and that Mr. Trump's emergence as the presumptive Republican nominee changes nothing. ""Full steam ahead, absolutely,"" said Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver.
On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders challenged Mrs. Clinton to a debate in California, which votes on June 7, something Mrs. Clinton had agreed to in February. A Clinton aide declined to comment on the prospect.
The Sanders campaign says it will fight to wrest the nomination away from Mrs. Clinton. While lagging behind in pledged delegates, those chosen by voters, he is even farther behind Mrs. Clinton among superdelegates, party leaders who can vote for whomever they like. His strategy is to win over the superdelegates by arguing he would be the stronger general-election candidate.
It is a difficult case to make. Mr. Sanders is asking party leaders -- the establishment that he rails against -- to overturn the will of Democratic voters, who have cast more votes for Mrs. Clinton than for him. Since Mr. Sanders announced this approach nearly two months ago, not a single superdelegate has switched sides.
Either way, Mr. Sanders plans to press for liberal policy issues at the party convention in Philadelphia in July. That means that, at minimum, the Clinton forces will face a strong push for policies that she has already rejected, such as a Medicare-style health-care plan for all, a carbon tax and a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage.
Ben Wikler, Washington director for liberal group MoveOn.org, said his members would back Mr. Sanders's push for the party to adopt ""the most progressive platform ever"" and characterized the coming debate as a ""fight for the soul"" of the party. But he said MoveOn opposes any effort to have superdelegates overturn the pledged delegates.
Others in the party are eager for Mr. Sanders to let up.
""It's time for Sen. Sanders to tone it down and stop criticizing her. . . . It's no longer at all helpful, and I'd argue that it's problematic,"" Steve Elmendorf, a veteran of Democratic campaigns who backs Mrs. Clinton, said Wednesday. ""People are going to start telling him that.""
For its part, the Clinton campaign has turned its attention almost completely to the general election. Mrs. Clinton is traveling to states with Democratic contests to make clear she will ""honor the primary"" process, and she believes Mr. Sanders should stay in the race as long as he likes, an aide said. But the campaign isn't spending money on TV ads in these states. It hasstarted hiring staff for general-election battleground states, and advisers are in the early stages of a vice-presidential selection process.
With fewer reporters covering Mr. Sanders's events, and the public increasingly focused on the general election, Clinton aides don't appear particularly concerned about the persistent Sanders attacks.
Rather, they say Mr. Trump's ascendance will help unify Democrats around her, and Wednesday the campaign emailed supporters with an anti-Trump message. ""This is really happening,"" it read. ""Trump is going to be the Republican nominee.""

"Election 2016: Clinton Counts on Others to Unite Party --- Support for likely nominee rests on moves by Obama, Trump and Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784663069?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- With her party's presidential nomination in sight, Hillary Clinton began wooing Bernie Sanders supporters to her campaign in earnest Tuesday night. But in the weeks to come, she will rely on others to finish much of the work of uniting Democrats behind her if she is the nominee.
The effort begins with Mrs. Clinton, who devoted a large chunk of her victory speech Tuesday to an explanation of what unites Democrats after months of talk about their divisions. But Mrs. Clinton and her staff are walking a narrow path: They want to welcome Sanders supporters without looking like they are trying to drive the Vermont senator out of the race before he is ready to go. At the same time, the Clinton campaign is eager to turn its attention to the general election and did so in a string of hits on Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Wednesday.
Interviews with Clinton campaign officials and other senior Democrats suggest three people in particular are likely to hold the key to uniting Democrats: Barack Obama, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders.
Barack Obama: The president remains enormously popular inside the Democratic Party, and had considered making an endorsement during the primaries -- presumably for Mrs. Clinton -- but he held off once it became apparent that she would be able to win without him.
That neutrality may give him particular credibility if and when he moves to unite Democrats around a nominee, and Clinton allies say he will be critical, particularly with young people who have flocked to Mr. Sanders's side and are essential for the future of the Democratic Party.
Tom Nides, who was a top deputy to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department and is now a senior executive at Morgan Stanley, said with Mr. Obama's active support, Mrs. Clinton could reach Obama-level support from young voters, despite her poor showing with them during the primaries.
""Barack Obama will be the unifying voice,"" he said.
The president appears up for the challenge. ""My most important role,"" he said last month, ""will be to make sure that after primaries [are] done I'm bringing everybody together so that we focus on winning the general election.""
A handful of other popular Democrats also could be helpful, notably Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who haven't made endorsements.
Donald Trump: Many Democrats predict that if he is the Republican nominee, he will serve as the great unifier. They argue that no Democrat, including supporters of Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, could favor Mr. Trump, who has insulted women, Muslims, Mexicans, the disabled and others. On Tuesday night, the Clinton campaign quickly cut a video highlighting Mr. Trump's comment at a news conference the same night that Mrs. Clinton wouldn't get 5% of the vote if she were a man.
""We're facing one of the greatest unifying forces in American politics. His name is Donald Trump,"" said Democratic consultant Chris Kofinis, who is unaffiliated in the primary. ""That's how we'll come together.""
Mr. Trump will be particularly helpful in driving young people to Mrs. Clinton, said John Della Volpe, who studies young voters at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. His polling finds that Mrs. Clinton is seen unfavorably by 53% of voters ages 18 to 29; Mr. Trump is seen unfavorably by 74% of those voters.
Bernie Sanders: Mrs. Clinton spoke passionately during a town-hall-style event on MSNBC this week about how she expects Mr. Sanders to bring his supporters around to her, just as she worked to bring her supporters around to Mr. Obama after he won their 2008 nomination contest.
Clinton aides like to quote Mr. Sanders's oft-made promise to do whatever he can to keep a Republican from winning the White House. But Mr. Sanders has sent mixed signals about his level of support.
Mrs. Clinton's top advisers and many others in the party say her biggest mistake would be trying to push him out of the race before he is ready.
""Sanders should stay in the race until the end. He has earned that right and his supporters in the remaining states deserve the opportunity to vote for him,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior aide during both of Mr. Obama's presidential campaigns.
But, Mr. Pfeiffer said,pushing his campaign to the convention if she has the nomination wrapped up makes no sense. ""That would be pointless and dishonest to his supporters, as well as a great gift to Donald Trump,"" he said.

The Clinton Pivot Begins,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784662907?accountid=12768,"Want to know which way America's political winds are blowing? When Bill Clinton speaks, listen.
Talking in Spokane last month about the U.S. economy, the former president mentioned ""the awful legacy of the last eight years."" In Indianapolis Tuesday, Mr. Clinton let the same cat out of the bag:
""The problem is, 80% of the American people are still living on what they were living on the day before the [2008 financial] crash. And about half the American people, after you adjust for inflation, are living on what they were living on the last day I was president 15 years ago. So that's what's the matter.""
Hours later, Hillary Clinton delivered her victory speech in Philadelphia after winning four of five primaries against Bernie Sanders. With that speech, the great Clinton pivot has begun. By the time she's done repositioning herself for the fall campaign run, most likely against Donald Trump, Hillary's pivots will make Stephen Curry look like a little old lady.
Note well this phrase toward the end: ""So my friends, if you are a Democrat, an Independent or a thoughtful Republican . . . .""
That doesn't quite sound like the Obama coalition of millennials, minorities and college-educated white women circa 2012. It sounds more like the centrist Clinton coalition, circa 1996. Democrats, independents and thoughtful Republicans -- call it neo-triangulation for Trumpian times.
Let's be clear. The success of the Trump candidacy is based on one, and only one, reality: two terms of weak, anxiety-producing economic growth under Barack Obama.
If growth and full-time jobs had revived in Mr. Obama's second term, the twin towers of the Trump campaign -- anti-trade sentiment and the Mexican wall -- would be second-level issues, if that.
Apple CEO Tim Cook also noted the cat was out of the bag this week, explaining the iconic brand's first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Apple, he said, was operating ""in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds."" That's for sure, and Hillary Clinton doesn't fight headwinds.
Thus, the victory speech's first pivot -- it was really more a head fake to the right -- came early, when she said, ""I want to thank the 42nd president of the United States, my husband."" The 42nd president looked pleased.
Pivot No. 2 came right after. Mrs. Clinton said she'd been traveling the country talking to people and learning about their struggles.
""Listen to the quiet determination of the working parents I met last week in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. They are doing everything they can to provide opportunities to their children in an economy where there still aren't enough good-paying jobs.""
Still? Watching this, one thought: Is the presumed extender of Barack Obama's third term explicitly separating herself from the economy under his watch for 7 1/2 years?
Next came the story of a nurse in New Haven, Conn., diagnosed with breast cancer and facing foreclosure, who told her, ""We're not asking for a handout."" Come again? For months, Mrs. Clinton has done little other than outbid Bernie Sanders for new federal handouts. Suddenly, she's moved cross court to invoke old-fashioned self-reliance.
Then came a description of a very dark economic landscape: ""And she is speaking for so many people across our country who feel beaten down, left out and left behind. People who have worked hard and done their part, but just can't seem to get ahead, and find it tough even to get by."" Welcome to ""Hunger Games.""
With the Obama economic legacy falling over, she then stepped back to drain the 3-pointer: ""And as a great Democratic president once said, 'There is nothing wrong with America that can't be cured by what's right with America.'"" The faithful cameras panned over to identify that great American president, Bill Clinton.
There was a grace note about the progressive tradition ""from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama."" But the Clinton campaign is bending to the obvious: Pressed by Donald Trump, she has to free herself from the undertow of the Obama economy.
Can she get away with the redo of a redo?
Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have proven American voters are so dazed and confused about what's been going on that it's possible to run as pretty much anything. And that's the sort of thing Bill Clinton would notice.
So if it's the economy again, stupid, why not reposition Hillary as the mutation of two successful Democratic presidents -- Franklin Roosevelt, to admit the hard times are real, and Bill Clinton's economic policies (he cut the capital gains tax to 20% and a boom followed) to signal independents and ""thoughtful Republicans"" that a sane version of the ascendant populism may be possible.
In 2008 during the Ohio Democratic primary, which Hillary won, I watched her in one day win over three auditoriums of mostly white, cheering blue-collar women. Now she has to win back their husbands and boyfriends.
The Clinton pivot into the Trump base has begun. It won't stand for anything principled or recognizable, but this year that doesn't seem to be the point.

Speaking of Hillary Clinton, she attacked Donald Trump on Wednesday for pillaging Atlantic City . But while his casino bankruptcies contributed to local problems, ""it takes more than one man to raze a city,"" notes a Journal editorial. ""New Jersey Democrats plundered Atlantic City casinos, redistributed the spoils and loaded up the city with unaffordable levels of debt. The gambling mecca is a five-star example of failed liberal policies .""
The rise of Mr. Trump has invited many theories. Our columnist Daniel Henninger has described it as ""the revolt of the politically incorrect. "" Today he adds that what has drawn so many millions into the Trump camp isn't just politically correctness itself, ""but that its proponents show such relentless moral contempt and superiority toward everyone else .""
Karl Rove notes that in six battleground states, ""Republicans have improved their registration numbers since 2012 , according to state election officials. In Florida--a must-win for Republicans--the GOP has gained a net of 114,126 registrations since 2012 while Democrats have lost 184,833, for a potential swing of 298,959 votes. President Barack Obama won Florida in 2012 by 74,309."" Mr. Rove sees more good news for the GOP in Arizona, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Pennsylvania .
""As the initial shock of Great Britain's vote to withdraw from the EU recedes, another withdrawal has been taking place,"" writes Kenneth Weinstein . ""This withdrawal, albeit more gradual and undertaken with greater stealth, has far deeper consequences. It is the exit of the United States from global leadership and the alliance structure that it built and nurtured over nearly seven decades."" He calls it President Obama's ""Amexit. ""
Speaking of Brexit, an Asian diplomat tells us that the U.K. may enjoy new opportunities for trade agreements now that it doesn't have to negotiate alongside protectionist countries like France.
Here in the U.S., the economy might not have been quite as bad as it looked recently, says National Federation of Independent Business Chief Economist William Dunkelberg. He's expecting some upward revisions in the lousy jobs numbers reported by the Department of Labor for May. Not that job creation was robust in June. Today NFIB will report in its latest small business survey: ""Reported job creation weakened in June, with the seasonally adjusted average employment change per firm posting a decline of -0.17 workers per firm.""

Clinton Casino Royale; She says Donald Trump killed Atlantic City. Here's the real story.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802059820?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton on Wednesday accused Donald Trump of looting his casinos and pillaging Atlantic City, and that was the gracious part. If she's going to criticize Mr. Trump's business record, she should also have to defend the failure of Atlantic City's model of progressive governance.
Democrats aim to rehash the story of how Mr. Trump loaded his casinos with debt and declared bankruptcy four times--stiffing creditors and workers while shielding himself personally--ad nauseam through November. ""He doesn't default and go bankrupt as a last resort,"" Mrs. Clinton declared. ""He does it over and over again on purpose."" She's one to talk about incorrigible behavior.
While Mr. Trump may have contributed to Atlantic City's downward spiral by oversaturating the casino market, it takes more than one man to raze a city. The businessman experienced a moment of lucidity--if only he could expand beyond 140 characters--when he fired back in a tweet that ""Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves--Convention Center, Airport--and destroyed City.""
In 1976 New Jersey voters approved a referendum that legalized gambling in Atlantic City. The constitutional amendment required casino revenues to fund programs for senior citizens and disabled residents, but politicians have instead funneled the cash to favored projects and businesses under the guise of promoting development. Guess how that's turned out?
A 1984 law required casinos to pay 2.5% of gaming revenues to the state or ""reinvest"" 1.25% in tax-exempt bonds issued by the state Casino Reinvestment Development Authority for state and community ""projects that would not attract capital in normal market conditions."" Investment recipients have included Best of Bass Pro shop, Margaritaville and Healthplex.
A decade later, state lawmakers imposed a $1.50 fee (which has since doubled) on casino parking spots to fund Atlantic City transportation, casino construction and a convention center. In 2004 lawmakers added a $3 surcharge for casino hotel stays to finance new hotel rooms and retail establishments, which had the effect of promoting unsustainable commercial and casino development.
Then came gambling competition, in Connecticut in 1992 and Pennsylvania in 2004. As more states in the Northeast legalized gaming, Atlantic City's monopoly withered. In 2014 four Atlantic City casinos shut down even as the state development authority reported $352.2 million in cash and investments and $103.2 million in annual revenues (equal to about a quarter of the city budget).
Irony alert: Mr. Trump in 1997 sued to block the state's redistribution of casino income when a competing developer stood to benefit from its investments. However, New Jersey's liberal Supreme Court ruled that voters should have known that the referendum was actually intended to revitalize Atlantic City tourism, not help seniors.
Employment in Atlantic City has declined by about 10% over the last decade. Since 2010 the city's property tax base has shrunk by two thirds. Local politicians raised property taxes by 50% between 2013 and 2014 to compensate for the dwindling tax base, but this has merely deterred new business investment and propelled flight.
Meantime, local politicians have continued to spend like they work for Google. Between 2010 and 2014, expenditures increased by 10% while government debt doubled. The city government spends about $6,600 a year per resident--more than any other city in the state including Newark ($2,344). Its budget exceeds that of nearly half of New Jersey's counties. Labor costs constitute about 70% of the budget.
Earlier this year, the city emergency manager projected a $393 million cumulative deficit over the next five years absent reforms. More than 100 workers have recently been laid off. In May Democratic legislators and Governor Chris Christie passed a bailout that allows the city to squeeze an additional $120 million out of casinos in revenues annually to compensate for lower property-tax revenue.
To sum up: New Jersey Democrats plundered Atlantic City casinos, redistributed the spoils and loaded up the city with unaffordable levels of debt. The gambling mecca is a five-star example of failed liberal policies.

"'Unforced Errors,' from Tennis to Politics; It's the political metaphor of the moment: Commentators have accused the campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump of making 'unforced errors'",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802493504?accountid=12768,"If you've been following coverage of the presidential race lately, you'd be forgiven for thinking that reporters are serving as line judges at a tennis match--and sloppy ones at that. The campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have been accused of making ""unforced errors,"" to use the political metaphor of the moment.
When Bill Clinton had an impromptu visit with Attorney General Loretta Lynch at the Phoenix airport last week, the encounter raised suspicions that he might be trying to influence the Justice Department investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of private email as secretary of state. ""That was unnecessary,"" said The Wall Street Journal's Gerald F. Seib. ""It's a bit of what you would call in tennis an unforced error.""
Mr. Trump, for his part, ""cannot seem to go two or three days without an unforced error,"" CBS News White House correspondent Major Garrett said earlier this week. And CNBC's John Harwood tweeted, ""extremely close battle for Unforced Error gold medal this summer.""
Perhaps political commentators have been watching too much Wimbledon, where tennis players can fall victim to unforced errors--like top-seed Novak Djokovic, who committed 31 of them in his surprise third-round loss last week to Sam Querrey.
In tennis reporting, ""unforced error"" has been used since the 1920s to describe self-inflicted miscues on ostensibly easy shots. But the term did not gain much traction until the 1970s, according to Josh Chetwynd in his new book, ""The Field Guide to Sports Metaphors.""
The term was formalized as a statistic in 1982, when Information and Display Systems incorporated the ""unforced error"" into a pioneering computerized stat-tracking system. The company defined it as an error by a player not made ""under any physical pressure as a result of the placement, pace, power or spin of their opponent's stroke."" Within a few years, Mr. Chetwynd notes, the expression seeped into other competitive endeavors, like chess and golf. It was only a matter of time, then, for pundits to seize on the term for needless political flubs.
During the 2000 primary season, for instance, a column in the Detroit Free Press by former editor Joe Stroud was headlined, ""Unforced Errors Dot the Campaign Landscape,"" though Mr. Stroud credited the phrase to basketball.
Five years later, George W. Bush's Supreme Court nomination of his White House counsel, Harriet Miers, was deemed an ""unforced error"" by David Frum, then writing for the National Review. (In the ensuing uproar, Mr. Bush withdrew the nomination at Ms. Miers's request.)
Now the Clinton-Trump matchup has brought the term to the fore. Los Angeles Times columnist Doyle McManus wrote last year of Mrs. Clinton's ""old propensity for unforced errors,"" while the Washington Post's James Hohmann has lambasted Mr. Trump's ""continuing unforced errors.""
The winner of the election may be whoever can manage to get the metaphorical ball over the net without mucking it up.

President Obama Says He Shares FBI Director's Concerns on Handling of Sensitive Data; FBI chief James Comey said Hillary Clinton's email use while secretary of state was 'extremely careless',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802600638?accountid=12768,"WARSAW--President Barack Obama said Saturday that he shares the concerns of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey over the State Department's handling of sensitive information.
Mr. Comey said last Tuesday that the FBI found evidence during an investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email use of a department ""generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information that is found elsewhere in the U.S. government.""
Asked for the first time about the FBI's findings during a news conference at the conclusion of an international summit in Poland , Mr. Obama said: ""I am concerned.""
Mr. Obama declined to comment on Mr. Comey's statements, such as that Mrs. Clinton and her colleagues had been what the FBI director said was ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.
Secretary of State John Kerry is working on a range of initiatives to try to ""get our arms around"" the problems Mr. Comey pinpointed about the culture of handling classified information at the department, Mr. Obama said.
""It reflects a larger problem in government,"" Mr. Obama said. He said that it is in part driven by the large amount of information which technology allows the government to gather, and which the State Department must sift through daily and classify properly.

The Myths of Black Lives Matter; The movement has won over Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But what if its claims are fiction?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802596665?accountid=12768,"Editor's Note: Originally published Feb. 11, 2016
A television ad for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign now airing in South Carolina shows the candidate declaring that ""too many encounters with law enforcement end tragically."" She later adds: ""We have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism.""
Her Democratic presidential rival, Bernie Sanders, met with the Rev. Al Sharpton on Wednesday. Mr. Sanders then tweeted that ""As President, let me be very clear that no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will."" And he appeared on the TV talk show ""The View"" saying, ""It is not acceptable to see unarmed people being shot by police officers.""
Apparently the Black Lives Matter movement has convinced Democrats and progressives that there is an epidemic of racist white police officers killing young black men. Such rhetoric is going to heat up as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders court minority voters before the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary.
But what if the Black Lives Matter movement is based on fiction? Not just the fictional account of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., but the utter misrepresentation of police shootings generally.
To judge from Black Lives Matter protesters and their media and political allies, you would think that killer cops pose the biggest threat to young black men today. But this perception, like almost everything else that many people think they know about fatal police shootings, is wrong.
The Washington Post has been gathering data on fatal police shootings over the past year and a half to correct acknowledged deficiencies in federal tallies. The emerging data should open many eyes.
For starters, fatal police shootings make up a much larger proportion of white and Hispanic homicide deaths than black homicide deaths. According to the Post database, in 2015 officers killed 662 whites and Hispanics, and 258 blacks. (The overwhelming majority of all those police-shooting victims were attacking the officer, often with a gun.) Using the 2014 homicide numbers as an approximation of 2015's, those 662 white and Hispanic victims of police shootings would make up 12% of all white and Hispanic homicide deaths. That is three times the proportion of black deaths that result from police shootings.
The lower proportion of black deaths due to police shootings can be attributed to the lamentable black-on-black homicide rate. There were 6,095 black homicide deaths in 2014--the most recent year for which such data are available--compared with 5,397 homicide deaths for whites and Hispanics combined. Almost all of those black homicide victims had black killers.
Police officers--of all races--are also disproportionately endangered by black assailants. Over the past decade, according to FBI data, 40% of cop killers have been black. Officers are killed by blacks at a rate 2.5 times higher than the rate at which blacks are killed by police.
Some may find evidence of police bias in the fact that blacks make up 26% of the police-shooting victims, compared with their 13% representation in the national population. But as residents of poor black neighborhoods know too well, violent crimes are disproportionately committed by blacks. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, though they made up roughly 15% of the population there.
Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities, raising officers' own risk of using lethal force.
The Black Lives Matter movement claims that white officers are especially prone to shooting innocent blacks due to racial bias, but this too is a myth. A March 2015 Justice Department report on the Philadelphia Police Department found that black and Hispanic officers were much more likely than white officers to shoot blacks based on ""threat misperception""--that is, the mistaken belief that a civilian is armed.
A 2015 study by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Greg Ridgeway, formerly acting director of the National Institute of Justice, found that, at a crime scene where gunfire is involved, black officers in the New York City Police Department were 3.3 times more likely to discharge their weapons than other officers at the scene.
The Black Lives Matter movement has been stunningly successful in changing the subject from the realities of violent crime. The world knows the name of Michael Brown but not Tyshawn Lee, a 9-year-old black child lured into an alley and killed by gang members in Chicago last fall. Tyshawn was one of dozens of black children gunned down in America last year. The Baltimore Sun reported on Jan. 1: ""Blood was shed in Baltimore at an unprecedented pace in 2015, with mostly young, black men shot to death in a near-daily crush of violence.""
Those were black lives that mattered, and it is a scandal that outrage is heaped less on the dysfunctional culture that produces so many victims than on the police officers who try to protect them.

Election 2016: Top Aides Quizzed In Clinton Probe,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787026822?accountid=12768,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation has interviewed senior aides to Hillary Clinton about her use of a private email server to conduct official State Department business -- an indication that the politically charged probe is nearing its end, according to people familiar with the matter.
Those interviewed include longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin, people familiar with the matter said. Ms. Abedin's lawyer didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
The investigation has centered on why and how Mrs. Clinton used a ""home brew"" email server for government business while she worked as secretary of state, and whether that setup compromised classified information.
A review of Mrs. Clinton's emails has found classified information in some of the messages, though her campaign has argued that those determinations are the result of interagency disputes about what is properly classified.
""From the start, Hillary Clinton has offered to answer any questions that would help the Justice Department complete its review, and we hope and expect that anyone else who is asked would do the same,"" said a Clinton campaign spokesman. ""We are confident the review will conclude that nothing inappropriate took place.""
Republicans and some former law-enforcement officials have argued that her conduct could be criminal, but so far there are few indications the probe is moving in the direction of such charges.
There has been no indication that a grand jury has been empaneled to hear evidence in the case, which would be a necessary step to trying to indict someone.
The Clinton aide who set up the email server, Bryan Pagliano, has been granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for cooperating with investigators. Mr. Pagliano, according to people familiar with his account, has told investigators he carried out the instructions given to him and doesn't believe he did anything wrong.
The FBI's findings will be presented to the Justice Department so it can make a determination whether charges should be pursued.

Election 2016: Clinton Targets Appalachia Votes --- Front-runner looks to rebuild support after comments on coal sector ignited fury,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785699249?accountid=12768,"Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton will embark on a two-day tour of Appalachia Monday, moving to strengthen what has been tepid support for the former secretary of state in coal country as the general election comes into focus.
During stops in Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio, Mrs. Clinton will focus on addressing economic disaffection, and she will make direct appeals to the rural and working-class white voters she has struggled to win over during the primary campaign.
Her visit comes ahead of contests in Kentucky and West Virginia this month, but it serves a dual purpose as the Clinton campaign turns its attention to the general election. Mrs. Clinton plans to campaign Tuesday in Ohio, a state that held its Democratic primary in March but will be a coveted prize in November.
""Hillary Clinton is focused on addressing the needs and aspirations of all Americans, especially those in communities that may often be overlooked,"" said Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary.
She will be in the Buckeye State when voters head to the polls Tuesday in Indiana, highlighting her shift away from a state-by-state duel with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary race and her preparations for a possible matchup with Republican front-runner Donald Trump in the general election.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday showed a tight race in Indiana, with Mrs. Clinton holding a 4-point lead among likely Democratic voters. The Clinton campaign is braced for a string of losses in other states that vote in May. But there aren't enoughdelegates at stake in these contests to change the dynamic of the Democratic primary race.
With her nearly insurmountable advantage in delegates and a clear path to becoming the Democratic nominee, Mrs. Clinton now can work on honing her message and building support among key voter blocs. In Appalachia, the former secretary of state's challenge will be to connect with white, working-class voters.
Mrs. Clinton scored resounding victories in Kentucky and West Virginia in 2008. But eight years later, she is marching toward the nomination with a decidedly different coalition, one that has been powered by minority voters, as well as urban and suburban professionals.
While Mrs. Clinton's support among rural and working-class white voters has eroded, Mr. Trump has gained traction in largely white and slow-to-diversify areas. The businessman's success in attracting working-class white voters who are frustrated by the country's shifting economics could prove a challenge for Mrs. Clinton in areas such as Appalachia.
Mrs. Clinton, though, arrives in coal country with some explaining to do after appearing to blithely predict that coal jobs would be lost under her presidency.
In March, as Mrs. Clinton spoke about how she hoped to spur economic activity in areas hurt by the decline of coal, she said her plans were needed ""because we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""
Her next sentence was, ""And we're going to make it clear that we don't want to forget those people."" But Republicans -- and some Democrats -- pounced on her remarks as insensitive to people affected by clean-energy policies.
Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), who had endorsed her, was so upset by the comment that he said he was prepared to cut political ties with Mrs. Clinton over the matter. ""I called her,"" the senator said in a March interview. ""I said, 'My God.'""
Mrs. Clinton replied by reassuring Mr. Manchin that she didn't want to cut political ties, he said in the interview, and she wrote him a letter saying she had been ""mistaken"" in her remarks.
Mrs. Clinton's emphasis on renewable energy is a serious concern in coal country. Hoping to mitigate that, she released a $30 billion plan in November aimed at revitalizing communities dependent on coal production.
Coal emits more pollution than any other energy type, and its use has been on the decline as the nation has worked to adopt cleaner sources of energy.

Election 2016: Clinton Aims for GOP Women,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787705066?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton spent Monday afternoon talking about equal pay, health care and education at a suburban coffee shop in Virginia, part of her presidential campaign's early work to try to win moderate Republican women put off by Donald Trump.
It won't be easy. Polling shows most suburban women with an unfavorable view of Mrs. Clinton, although many more dislike Mr. Trump.
During her conversation with young parents, Mrs. Clinton voiced support for universal prekindergarten, less testing in school and lower health-care costs. She said it is ""heartbreaking"" to have to discuss the possibility of gun violence in schools with children.
And when the question of pay equity for women came up, she alluded to Mr. Trump, saying she has been ""accused of playing the gender card and all that.""
The group gathered in Loudoun County, an exurb of Washington that swings between Democrats and Republicans, responded with a knowing chuckle. ""But the fact is it's a real problem,"" Mrs. Clinton said Monday at the Mug 'N Muffin in Stone Ridge, Va.
The Clinton campaign is seeking to improve on President Barack Obama's 2012 performance with suburban white women, seeing these voters as a hedge against possibly deeper losses among working-class white men. The emergence of Mr. Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee has made that task more promising, officials say, and potentially more urgent.
There is some data to support the idea that Mrs. Clinton could improve on Mr. Obama's 2012 showing. He lost married women to Republican Mitt Romney by 7 percentage points, and lost white women by 8 points.
During the early, more competitive Republican primaries this year, Mr. Trump lost many of the heavily populated suburbs that help decide general elections.
For instance, he carried Virginia but lost the voter-rich suburbs of Washington. He pulled 34.8% of the overall vote, but just 27.9% in Loudoun County.
Mr. Trump, who says he ""cherishes"" women, maintains he would do well with female voters. Some Republicans predict that Mr. Trump can make gains among white working-class voters -- including women -- in states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Mr. Trump also has said he would pick up disaffected supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton's primary rival, who is also seen as an antiestablishment figure.
The former secretary of state is trying to make space for Republicans to come to her, partly by venturing to places like Loudoun County and meeting with people who may disagree with her, her aides said.
Neil Newhouse, a Republican polling expert who worked for Mr. Romney in 2012, said suburban, married women are ""definitely up for grabs in this election"" and predicted that Mr. Trump would have a much harder time winning them than Mr. Romney did.
""These are not voters who want to vote for Hillary Clinton,"" he said. ""They generally don't like her. They don't trust her. They think she's too much a politician. But right now Donald Trump has a long ways to go to make the sale with these voters.""
The April Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 40% of suburban women had a positive view of Mrs. Clinton, and 50% had a negative view. But that is much better than Mr. Trump, who had 21% positive and 67% negative.
Mr. Newhouse added that once a swing or Republican woman decides to vote for Mrs. Clinton, it would be ""really hard to win her back."" Mrs. Clinton, he said, is ""starting on our 20-yard-line.""

Election 2016: Clinton Forced to Keep Fighting for Votes --- The Democratic front- runner's supporters step up pressure on Sanders to stand down,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787704840?accountid=12768,"Although she retains an overwhelming lead in the Democratic presidential contest, Hillary Clinton is expected to fall short in the West Virginia primary Tuesday and could come out of May with a three-state losing streak.
Democrats who support her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, show no sign that they are prepared to abandon him in deference to Mrs. Clinton's status as the all-but-certain nominee.
Polling shows Mr. Sanders with a small lead in West Virginia, and even Mrs. Clinton has conceded that her chances are ""pretty difficult"" in one of the nation's least racially diverse states. In many cases, Mrs. Clinton has struggled in states where a large share of residents are white.
In West Virginia, she also has been hurt by recent comments that were viewed as anticoal.
Mr. Sanders also is poised for strong showings on May 17 in Kentucky and Oregon, states with comparatively few of the minority voters who have proved loyal to Mrs. Clinton in prior contests. That Mr. Sanders is still winning states at this late stage in the Democratic fight points to persistent divisions within the party as Mrs. Clinton closes in on the nomination.
The former secretary of state has 2,228 delegates, about 94% of the total needed to clinch the nomination. Mr. Sanders has 1,454 delegates.
Republicans also vote tomorrow in West Virginia, as well as in Nebraska, though billionaire Donald Trump is the only remaining competitive candidate.
In the Democratic race, allies of Mrs. Clinton say they would like to see Mr. Sanders accept the inevitable and drop out, allowing Mrs. Clinton to focus her fire and campaign resources on Mr. Trump.
Mr. Sanders has said he is determined to give his supporters a chance to vote for him until the final contest on June 14. His campaign also hopes to maximize his delegate total so that he has more clout in shaping the Democratic platform at the party's convention in Philadelphia in July.
""Look, if you asked what is the best thing for the party, it would be to just get this thing wrapped up and focus on Donald Trump,"" said James Carville, a senior adviser in Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential election victory.
With Mr. Sanders in the race, Mrs. Clinton is compelled to spend money and time on the primaries.
Losing states is ""more than embarrassing -- it is absolutely injurious to her political fortunes,"" said Doug Schoen, a pollster who has advised Bill Clinton.
Mr. Sanders ""hurts her ability to solidify the party and to raise money and to campaign effectively against Donald Trump. All of those are very, very bad,"" Mr. Schoen said.
For Mrs. Clinton, the costs of the prolonged Democratic race are growing more evident. On Wednesday, she is scheduled to make a campaign stop in New Jersey, whose primary is set for June 7.
New Jersey is a solid blue state in presidential elections, having voted for the Democratic nominee since 1992. From the standpoint of winning a general election, it would be more useful for Mrs. Clinton to spend time in traditional battleground states, one of her campaign fundraisers said Monday.
Similarly, Mrs. Clinton spent $2.7 million on campaign ads in Pennsylvania prior to the April 26 primary. She didn't want to risk losing the state to Mr. Sanders, who spent $4 million on ads in Pennsylvania.
Mrs. Clinton wound up winning the state, but if she had no competition in Pennsylvania, the front-runner could have saved the money for the general election.
In her 2008 presidential bid against then-Sen. Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton stayed in the race until June. So, she risks sounding unfair if she calls on Mr. Sanders to drop out. But she is edging closer to the line. In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS, she seemed to be urging him to reconsider and step aside.
""Isee a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party,"" she said, ""to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share.""
Should Mr. Sanders stay in the race, some of her allies want to see him spare Mrs. Clinton and exclusively target Mr. Trump.

Tom Perez's Clinton Bait,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787704301?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is said to be considering Tom Perez as a running mate, and the Labor Secretary is working overtime on his progressive resume. Take the Labor Department's new ""persuader rule,"" which gives unions another tool to bludgeon business.
The rule recently took effect and is supposedly intended to update the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which mandates that ""persuaders"" hired by employers to communicate directly with workers publicly disclose their clients, services and remuneration. Employers must also disclose this information. However, the law explicitly exempts from disclosure any advice an employer receives in confidence that is protected by attorney-client privilege, a bedrock legal principle that enables employers to seek counsel without worrying that their communications could be exposed in a legal proceeding.
Labor's new rule in effect nullifies this long-time exemption by requiring disclosures from employers and anyone engaged in ""actions, conduct, or communications that are undertaken with an object, explicitly or implicitly, directly or indirectly, to affect an employee's decisions regarding his or her representation or collective bargaining rights."" This could cover virtually all labor-relations communications.
For example, an employer would likely have to report asking a consultant to study the labor savings of moving to a right-to-work state. An attorney would have to disclose private discussions with an employer over a neutrality agreement to support a union's organizing campaign. Only communications in actual collective-bargaining negotiations and with internal counsel will remain exempt.
Here's the extra rabbit punch: The 1959 law requires that any persuader also must disclose all clients for which they provide ""labor relations advice or services."" This has rarely applied since most attorney-employer communications weren't deemed persuader activities. But now an attorney who advises Employer A about a union organizing campaign will also have to report if he's conducting, say, a sexual harassment investigation at Employer B. All of this information will be public.
As former American Bar Association president Bill Robinson told Congress, attorneys will be less willing to represent employers. And employers will be more reluctant to seek outside counsel on union-related issues and may thus become more prone to run afoul of multiplying federal rules. Large businesses can deploy in-house lawyers and consultants to skirt the rule, but small businesses will suffer as usual. The Manhattan Institute estimates the rule will cost about $60 billion over 10 years.
The beneficiaries will be unions, which don't have to report their own persuader activities. Their goal is to use private employer communications to bully businesses into backing their organizing campaigns.
Alabama Rep. Bradley Byrne has introduced a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to block the rule, which has already drawn legal challenges in Texas, Minnesota and Arkansas. Congress should vote to overturn it, and the courts should examine Labor's dubious justification for rewriting a 57-year-old statute.",2016-07-13
Finance Sector Gives Clinton A Boost --- Some Wall Street funds shift from GOP candidates who have exited the race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787448225?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is consolidating her support among Wall Street donors and other businesses ahead of a general-election battle with Donald Trump, winning more campaign contributions from financial-services executives in the most recent fundraising period than all other candidates combined.
The Democratic front-runner has raised $4.2 million in total from Wall Street, $344,000 of which was contributed in March alone. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of fundraising data provided by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the former secretary of state received 53% of the donations from Wall Street in March, up from 32% last year and 33% in January through February, as the nominating contests began.
The analysis of campaign-finance reports shows that some Wall Street donors have shifted their financial support from Republican candidates who dropped out of the race, such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to Mrs. Clinton in recent months.
Mr. Trump, by contrast, hasn't garnered more than 1% of Wall Street contributions in any month through March.
To be sure, it is still early in the general election money race, and Mr. Trump hasn't aggressively pursued the finance sector for funds so far. He self-financed about three-quarters of his primary campaign and said last week that he planned to more actively solicit donations for the general election in order to keep pace with Mrs. Clinton.
Already, some Wall Street donors have said they plan to back him, including billionaire investor Ken Langone and hedge-fund founder Anthony Scaramucci. Last week, Mr. Trump named as his national finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs employee who now serves as CEO of hedge fund Dune Capital Management.
Still, Mrs. Clinton's ability so far to draw the support of business donors, even those who lean Republican, suggests she is reversing the flow of Wall Street money toward the GOP ever since big banks, investment firms and hedge funds fell out of favor with President Barack Obama.
In the 2012 presidential election, the financial-services sector donated more than any other industry, topping $90 million in total contributions to campaigns. Some three times as much of that Wall Street money went to Republican nominee Mitt Romney as to Mr. Obama.
Mrs. Clinton's popularity on Wall Street could prove a liability with some liberal voters, as primary rival Bernie Sanders has attacked her for being too cozy with the financial industry. But winning back a sizable chunk of money that went to Mr. Romney four years ago would likely give Mrs. Clinton a big fundraising advantage in the general election.
Campaigns aren't required to disclose their fundraising for April until later this month. Mrs. Clinton's campaign has said it raised a total of $213 million through April, and Mr. Trump's campaign raised $49 million through March, $36 million of which came from his own personal loans.
An analysis by the nonpartisan organization Crowdpac found that more than 500 donors, including many Wall Street executives, who gave more than $200 to a Republican who later dropped out, including Messrs. Bush and Rubio, have since given to Mrs. Clinton. More than one-third of the money that business interests have donated to presidential campaigns has gone to Mrs. Clinton's coffers, the Journal's analysis found.
Andrew Weinstein, a former Republican strategist and adviser at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that companies ""hate uncertainty around tax, regulatory and trade policy"" and so may steer clear of backing Mr. Trump.
""Business interests are generally not sold on the notion that Trump will be a more business-friendly candidate; there's a lot about Trump they don't know,"" said Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist.
Mario Paredes, until recently an investment professional at Merrill Lynch, had been a lifelong donor to Republican candidates, last year donating to long-shot presidential candidate George Pataki, a former New York governor. As Mr. Trump began to emerge as the top Republican vote-getter, Mr. Paredes donated the maximum amount allowed to Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
""I have changed my mind,"" said Mr. Paredes, who has since left his job as head of Hispanic outreach at Merrill Lynch. ""I cannot accept some of the statements of Mr. Trump, especially related to Hispanic Americans.""
Even some donors who previously backed Mr. Trump have since changed their minds. Ralph Herzka, CEO and founder of the investment advisory firm Meridian Capital Partners, is among the couple hundred donors who have donated the maximum to Mr. Trump's campaign, giving $2,700 late last June. He appears to have since soured on the real-estate billionaire, donating twice that amount to Mrs. Clinton in January -- $2,700 for the primary, and another $2,700 for the general. Mr. Herzka declined to comment through a spokesman.
The shift in money from financial-services executives to Mrs. Clinton's campaign comes as other big GOP donors are now staying neutral.
Earlier this year, some of the Republican Party's biggest donors began spending millions against Mr. Trump. A group of major Wall Street contributors including Paul Singer of Elliot Management Corporation and Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management have helped an anti-Trump super PAC raise $16 million through the end of March. The family of Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, gave $5.5 million. With the nomination fight essentially over, the group has gone quiet.
One of the biggest pro-Republican super PACs in the last presidential election, American Crossroads, says for now it plans to focus on Senate races and is still considering whether to get involved in the presidential race.
The super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA Action, is also heavily backed by Wall Street donors, who gave $18.7 million to the group through March, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. No other industry has given more to the super PAC.

Santa Fe, N.M.
The decision by Mrs. Clinton and her staff to set up her own email network was conceived and executed to allow her first crack at parsing her communications, now at 30,000 and climbing. In making that decision she had to face whether her interest in protecting these self-determined ""personal"" messages from public disclosure was greater than her interest in protecting the secure communications of the U.S. She chose to protect her personal interests.

ObamaCare's Next Act; Clinton and Obama revive the 'public option' road to single payer.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803285614?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders formalized the Democratic Party's left turn on Tuesday, finally endorsing Hillary Clinton and praising her for embracing so many of his ideas. ""We have begun a political revolution to transform America, and that revolution continues,"" the Vermont socialist said--and the latest evidence for his boast is the revival of ObamaCare's ""public option.""
This liberal ambition--a new health-care entitlement akin to Medicare for all middle-class Americans under age 65--couldn't pass a Democratic Congress in 2010. Mrs. Clinton revived the public option over the weekend, and now President Obama is also lending his support, in an op-ed that appears under his byline in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association.
Mr. Obama's hails the ""substantial progress"" his namesake law has achieved but calls for higher subsidies and drug price controls. He adds that ""Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers,"" which he writes will ""deliver care more cost-effectively"" and help ""areas of the country where competition is limited.""
Mr. Obama is re-endorsing what he had hoped in 2010 would be a way station for government-run single payer that would gradually wipe out anything resembling private insurance. Insurers can't outbid a ""free"" program that is open to all or most and has the unlimited access to the Treasury that Medicare enjoys. A market exodus would be inevitable.
Democrats claim this would merely be another choice, but they tried a trial-run public option with ObamaCare's co-ops, which were given up-front federal cash infusions and then were supposed to operate like normal companies. Of the original 24 co-ops, only nine are alive--and most of the survivors are ailing.
The ""first lesson"" of ObamaCare, Mr. Obama muses, is that ""any change is difficult, but it is especially difficult in the face of hyper-partisanship."" He means Republicans, naturally, but the real history is that centrist Democrats consigned the public option to a death panel. The bill was already deeply unpopular with voters and the health industry was disinclined to be put out of business, so the White House tried to summon a softer-focus image.
Even after jettisoning the public option, ObamaCare passed the Senate with a bare 60-vote majority and the House 219-212, though Democrats commanded their largest majorities since the Great Society. Republicans couldn't stop anything, but they did oppose the public option for the same reasons as the business community and moderate Democrats: Over time, its radicalism would annex all of U.S. health-care finance.
Democrats denied that ObamaCare was the next step to single payer, but now they have resumed their march to government-run health care, as everyone knew they would.

The Democratic Platform's Sharp Left Turn; This isn't Bill Clinton's party anymore. It isn't even Barack Obama's.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803279905?accountid=12768,"In parliamentary systems, party platforms are blueprints for governance. In the U.S., they reflect the preferences of each party's base--the activists and interest groups to which the party must pay attention. Changes in party platforms from one election to the next reveal shifts in thinking and--even more--the balance of power within the base as new groups surge and established forces give way.
That is why the 2016 Democratic platform is so significant. The platform committee hasn't made public the text that will be taken to the Democratic convention in less than two weeks. But at this stage, based on the July 1 draft and 82 amendments to its text adopted by the end of the final platform committee meeting in Orlando, Fla., we know with near-certainty what the platform will say--and what it means.
The party that Hillary Clinton will lead into battle this fall is not Bill Clinton's Democratic Party. In important respects it is not even Barack Obama's Democratic Party. It is a party animated by the frustrations of the Obama years and reshaped by waves of economic and social activism.
Not surprisingly, the document endorses a range of Hillary Clinton's campaign proposals, including a massive infrastructure-investment program, new incentives for small business, expanded profit-sharing to increase workers' earnings, a tax on high-frequency financial transactions, paid family and medical leave, an enhanced earned-income tax credit for young workers without children, access to computer-science education for all K-12 students, and measures to make college education more affordable.
Neither is it surprising that the draft incorporates some of Bernie Sanders's key proposals--most notably, a $15 per hour minimum wage--and that it doesn't take sides on issues that divided the party, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and a broad tax on financial transactions, where neither side would give way.
In other respects, however, the draft is truly remarkable--for example, its near-silence on economic growth. The uninformed reader would not learn that the pace of recovery from the Great Recession has been anemic by postwar standards, or that productivity gains have slowed to a crawl over the past five years, or that firms have been reluctant to invest in new productive capacity. Rather, the platform draft's core narrative is inequality, the injustice that inequality entails, and the need to rectify it through redistribution.
In her speech announcing her candidacy last year, Mrs. Clinton identified government reform as one of the four ""fights"" she would wage on behalf of the American people. She said that government ""is never going to have all the answers--but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner. That means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people."" She added: ""We need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.""
Four years ago, the Democratic platform contained a detailed section on ""21st Century Government,"" including a discussion of cost-effective regulatory reform, but this section finds no parallel--indeed, barely an echo--in the 2016 draft. One would never guess that Americans' trust in the federal government is scraping bottom and that confidence-building measures are desperately needed.
Instead, this year's platform will be suffused with proposals to expand the government's reach and cost--and with confidence that today's government is up to the job. As long as Americans don't regard their national institutions as effective instruments of public purpose, many of these proposals--not all--will be a hard sell.
Another notable feature of the 2016 draft is its intensified social liberalism. The 2012 platform declared that the death penalty must not be ""arbitrary""; this year, the platform will demand--for the first time ever--the death penalty's abolition. The 2012 platform called for the reasonable regulation of guns but pledged to preserve ""Americans' Second Amendment Right to own and bear firearms."" There is no reference to the Second Amendment this time.
Calling for ""constitutionally sound, evidence-based partnerships"" with faith-based institutions, the 2012 platform declared that ""there is no conflict between supporting faith-based institutions and respecting our Constitution."" Such language appears nowhere in the 2016 draft. But the document does call for a constitutional amendment that would make it possible to overturn decades of Supreme Court decisions on campaign finance.
The 2012 platform contained a handful of muted references to racial issues; this year's draft places them in the foreground. The document pledges the Democratic Party to promote racial justice as well as environmental and climate justice, to advocate for criminal-justice reform, and to push for a ""societal transformation"" to make it clear that ""black lives matter and there is no place for racism in our country.""
In this document, Hillary Clinton has made her peace with the Democratic Party as she found it in this tumultuous political year. Whether she would be able to lead a badly divided country on this basis--or whether she would choose to do so--is another matter.

Election 2016: Another Sanders Speed Bump for Clinton --- West Virginia win gives him a boost as presidential campaign heads to West Coast,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787894219?accountid=12768,"MARTINSBURG, W.Va. -- Bernie Sanders defeated front-runner Hillary Clinton in West Virginia on Tuesday, regaining momentum and leaving some of Mrs. Clinton's backers uneasy that her path to the Democratic presidential nomination figures to be rocky to the end.
""I'm always uncomfortable when she loses,"" said New Hampshire state Sen. Lou D'Allesandro, a Clinton supporter. ""Every time [Mr. Sanders] presents himself and presents his story, more people start talking about him. And that goes on and on.""
On the Republican side, presumptive nominee Donald Trump easily won primaries in West Virginia and Nebraska.
The New York businessman no longer has any opposition, having cleared the once-crowded GOP field. Still, he continues to campaign in primary states, pursuing the magic number of 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the party nomination.
Mr. Trump spent the weekend stumping in West Virginia and Nebraska, and he appeared in the next two states on the GOP calendar, Oregon and Washington.
Mr. Trump has set his gaze on the general election in the fall, setting up a fundraising team and tapping New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to lead the transition should he be elected president.
A Sanders victory of any size in West Virginia wasn't about to dislodge Mrs. Clinton from her commanding position in a primary fight that has outlasted the Republican contest. West Virginia offers only 29 Democratic delegates and, under party rules that award them on a proportional basis, Mrs. Clinton was unlikely to come away empty-handed.
But polls suggest Mr. Sanders could notch wins next week in Oregon and Kentucky, demonstrating that a sizable wing of the party remains attracted to his populist message and isn't yet ready to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton. Victories also tend to fuel Mr. Sanders's fundraising, giving him more money to air TV ads and prolong the fight.
Mr. D'Allesandro, the New Hampshire lawmaker, said he has written emails to the Clinton campaign asking that they compete more aggressively in upcoming contests. ""You want to enter the convention with the best possible wind at your back. That means W's [wins].""
At this stage in the contest, the delegate math remains decisively in Mrs. Clinton's favor. She led Mr. Sanders by 290 pledged delegates heading into the West Virginia primary. With superdelegates thrown in, her lead stood at 2,228 to 1,454. Superdelegates are elected officials and party leaders who can vote for whichever candidate they prefer.
A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.
Mr. Sanders reiterated in a statement Tuesday night that he intends to stay in the race: ""We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination and we're going to stay in the race until the last vote is cast.""
He added: ""We fully acknowledge we have an uphill climb ahead of us, but we're used to that. We have been fighting uphill from the day this campaign began. And after all the votes are cast and counted and this contest moves to the Democratic National Convention.""
Mrs. Clinton is likely to have a better month in June, when large, diverse states such as California and New Jersey hold primaries. She has fared better in states with large concentrations of minority voters.
But until she clinches the nomination, she is forced to spend money and time on the primary race, lest she endure more potentially embarrassing defeats.
Losses to Mr. Sanders are ""absolutely injurious to her political fortunes,"" said Doug Schoen, a pollster who has advised Bill Clinton. ""He hurts her ability to solidify the party and to raise money and to campaign effectively against Donald Trump.""
One of Mrs. Clinton's top advisers suggested her campaign isn't about to waste resources and is aware that the central battle is the showdown with Mr. Trump.
""You finish out the primaries, and you allocate your resources carefully and intelligently because the task ahead for the next six months is to defeat Donald Trump,"" said Joel Benenson, a senior Clinton strategist.
For Mrs. Clinton, West Virginia never looked to be easy. Democrats there hold an ""open"" primary, meaning independents are allowed to take part. Mr. Sanders typically scores well among independents.
Ken Mauck, 57, described himself as an independent who voted Tuesday for Mr. Sanders. ""Even though I don't agree with Bernie's politics, I agree less with Hillary,"" he said. ""She can't lead, why should I vote for her to be the leader of my county?""
Mrs. Clinton did herself no favors when she said at a town-hall meeting in March that her policies would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""
Though she also voiced concern for the plight of displaced coal miners, her remarks caused damage that she later sought to minimize. In a visit to West Virginia last week, she said her remarks were taken out of context and that she would work to boost employment in the state. Still, she conceded: ""I know that my chances are pretty difficult [in West Virginia], to be honest.""
Mr. Sanders faces a dilemma of his own. He concedes that erasing Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead is difficult in the 11 contests that remain.
David Wasserman, a delegate expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said before the West Virginia results were in that Mr. Sanders would need to win 65% of the remaining pledged delegates to pull even with Mrs. Clinton.
The Vermont senator is pinning his hopes on superdelegates abandoning Mrs. Clinton and lining up behind his campaign even if he ends the race trailing in pledged delegates.
Some of his supporters believe that's a flawed strategy. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), who has endorsed Mr. Sanders, said: ""I don't think it would feel right in terms of the pledged delegates if one person wins and that's overturned by the superdelegates.""

"Election 2016: Emails Weigh on Clinton Campaign --- Democratic candidate will have to address probes by FBI, GOP- led panels for months",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788165833?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- As Hillary Clinton moves closer to clinching the Democratic nomination, it is increasingly clear that the investigations and a lawsuit over her email practices as secretary of state could complicate her campaign in coming months.
The political and legal minefield includes a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of her email practices, a civil lawsuit by a conservative legal group in which Mrs. Clinton may be called to testify, a series of investigations led by congressional Republicans, and a government-watchdog report on the email practices of former secretaries of state.
Each event has the potential to capture headlines for a day or more and throw the campaign at least temporarily off message as Mrs. Clinton seeks to look beyond a stiff primary challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders and draw a contrast with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.
On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey declined to comment on whether the Clinton email inquiry would conclude before or after the presidential election. ""In any investigation, especially one of intense public interest. . .we want to do it well, and we want to do it promptly. So I feel pressure to do both of those things,"" he told reporters. ""As between the two, we will always choose 'well.' ""
Mrs. Clinton has denied any wrongdoing in her use of the private email server and her handling of classified information as secretary of state, expressing confidence that she will be vindicated. She has apologized for her use of the private server, which was discouraged but not explicitly banned by the State Department, calling it a ""mistake"" not to use a government system. The Clinton campaign didn't respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
Mr. Trump has already signaled an eagerness to focus on Mrs. Clinton's perceived lapses, dubbing her ""crooked Hillary."" That message pushes back against Democratic arguments that Mr. Trump, with his lack of government experience and penchant for outspoken statements, is uniquely unqualified for the presidency.
Mr. Trump faces his own legal challenges -- he is expected to testify at a civil fraud trial in California beginning in November brought by former students against him and the now-defunct Trump University. His testimony would come after the election. Mr. Trump has denied the students' allegations, saying many of them gave the courses high marks.
Polls suggest the email controversy has had an impact on Mrs. Clinton's standing. In an April Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, 60% of voters gave her poor marks on being honest and straightforward, while only 19% give her high ratings on those traits.
The FBI is expected to conclude its inquiry in coming weeks or months, likely including an interview of Mrs. Clinton herself. The bureau has already interviewed her top aides. There is no evidence a grand jury has been impaneled to hear evidence, a necessary step in any indictment.
The FBI inquiry was sparked by the discovery of classified material on Mrs. Clinton's private server, which her campaign has suggested is a result of over-classification. None of the emails contained markings indicating that they contained classified information at the time Mrs. Clinton sent or received them.
Mrs. Clinton also must contend with a forthcoming report by State Department Inspector General Steve Linick, an independent government watchdog appointed by President Barack Obama. That report, expected in coming weeks, is examining the use of email by the five previous secretaries.
Depending on its findings, that report could give the Clinton campaign ammunition to argue that secretaries of both parties used private email. Still, Correct the Record, a group run by Mrs. Clinton's allies, pre-emptively moved to discredit the report last week by noting a top official in the IG's office formerly worked for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. His panel is also probing issues related to Mrs. Clinton's time in office.
""Partisan politics plays no role in our oversight work at [the Office of the Inspector General], and our work on this review is no exception,"" said Douglas Welty, a spokesman for Mr. Linick.
Not all of Mrs. Clinton's challenges come from official probes. A lawsuit by the conservative group Judicial Watch, seeking records from State Department documents under the Freedom of Information Act, will result in public testimony under oath by Mrs. Clinton's top aides, and possibly Mrs. Clinton herself.
The investigations into Mrs. Clinton are also taking place on a polarized Capitol Hill, where at least two GOP-led Senate committees are probing her emails. Even after the FBI investigation concludes, House aides expect a push for further scrutiny of the Clinton emails by several panels.

"Trump vs. Clinton, Beyond the Cage Match",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788165777?accountid=12768,"This presidential campaign is good at producing attention-grabbing train wrecks. Last week Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump as ""a loose cannon."" In turn, Mr. Trump called Mrs. Clinton ""the total enabler"" of her husband's affairs, and then he suggested that America repudiate some of its national debt.
This kind of back-and-forth in the 25 weeks left before Election Day may draw attention. But what will largely decide the contest -- what will sway voters in the end -- is the candidates' success in emphasizing their principal selling points and undermining each other's.
Mrs. Clinton argues that experience and temperament make her more qualified. Mr. Trump only claims that he will bring about necessary change. Polling shows both narratives have traction.
In the April NBC/Wall Street Journal survey, 53% of voters rated Mrs. Clinton good or very good on ""being knowledgeable and experienced enough to handle the presidency""; 26% graded her poor or very poor. By comparison, only 21% rated Mr. Trump good or very good, and 61% poor or very poor. When pollsters asked if Mrs. Clinton had the ""right temperament"" for the job, 41% rated her positively. Only 12% said that of Mr. Trump.
Team Clinton will attempt to depict Mr. Trump as ignorant and unbalanced. Mrs. Clinton pounced this week when John Dickerson asked her on ""Face the Nation"" about the ""loose cannon"" remark. She attacked Mr. Trump for saying Japan and South Korea should acquire nuclear weapons, for declaring NATO obsolete, and for arguing the U.S. should target the families of terrorists, ""which would be a war crime.""
For good measure, she rapped him for his comments on abortion: ""When he says women should be punished for having abortions, what does that mean?"" She suggested his comments on the debt demonstrate that ""he just doesn't understand that running our government is not the same as making real estate deals."" One difficulty of this approach is that it further paints Mrs. Clinton as status quo, a third term for President Obama.
Mr. Trump's appeal comes from a powerful desire for change. In the recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 24% of voters thought America was ""generally headed in the right direction,"" and 70% felt ""that things are off on the wrong track."" These numbers are historically high and have been getting worse. Desire for change like this has led to defeat in six of the seven modern elections when a party was striving for a third White House term.
But the real-estate mogul has yet to convince enough people he is the man to set America back on track. When pollsters asked if Mr. Trump would bring ""real change to the direction of the country,"" 37% of voters responded positively, and 43% negatively. Mrs. Clinton's numbers on the same question were 22% positive and 49% negative.
The reality-TV star's problem is that voters don't give him the overwhelming edge on change that Mrs. Clinton enjoys on experience and temperament. Not being Hillary is good, but insufficient. His challenge is twofold: He must show that his business experience better prepares him to be president than Mrs. Clinton's years in government prepare her. And he must demonstrate a satisfactory grasp on what needs to be done, so that voters conclude he has what it takes to bring about change.
Mr. Trump rarely goes beyond applause lines. One of his best is a call to care for veterans. Why not couple this with an attack on Mrs. Clinton for claiming last fall that mismanagement at Veterans Affairs ""has not been as widespread as it has been made out to be""? Hillary opposes the main alternative to the broken VA system, namely Sen. John McCain's proposal to allow veterans to get care from private doctors at the government's expense: Mr. Trump should extol this legislation at every opportunity.
The New York businessman could also attack efforts by government-employee unions to water down measures making it easier to fire or demote VA officials. He might offer up one of his patented slogans: ""If you abuse a vet, you're fired.""
But adding substance to his campaign requires preparation and discipline, traits Mr. Trump lacks. His team demonstrates little interest in fleshing out his agenda, apparently convinced that Mr. Trump can roll to the White House on tweets and personal attacks alone.
Maybe, but winning a general election is different than prevailing in a 17-way primary with 40% support. Unless Mr. Trump gets better at reassuring skeptical swing voters, Mrs. Clinton could overcome the strong desire for change afoot in the land.

The Clinton Business Model . . .,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788694481?accountid=12768,"Democrats are starting to ask if Hillary Clinton could lose to Donald Trump, and one reason they should worry appeared on page one of the Journal on Friday. Our news colleagues tell the story of how Bill Clinton used the nonprofit Clinton Global Initiative to funnel private money to a company owned by friends of Bill and Hillary.
The Clinton Global Initiative -- a program of the nonprofit Clinton Foundation -- greased the wheels in 2010 for a Canadian businesswoman, Kim Samuel, to make a $2 million financial commitment to a green-energy company, Energy Pioneer Solutions. The company was founded in 2009 by Scott Kleeb, a Democrat who ran and lost twice for Congress in Nebraska and had a 29% stake in the company -- according to 2009 documents cited by the Journal.
Another 29% was owned by Julie Tauber McMahon, a close friend and neighbor of the Clintons in Chappaqua, New York. Five percent was owned by Andrew Tobias, the Democratic National Committee treasurer, and another 5% by former Rhode Island Democratic Party chairman Mark Weiner. Both of the latter are also longtime Clinton friends.
The story makes clear that the financial transaction was facilitated mainly by Bill Clinton. Meanwhile, the Journal reports that Messrs. Weiner and Tobias have each donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit that Bill and Hillary have used to promote their public image and employ their political aides and friends between election campaigns. Mr. Weiner owns a company that has provided products for Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaigns.
Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian is spinning this as ""common practice"" and ""mission-driven investing."" But the law says nonprofits, which are exempt from most taxation, aren't supposed to act on the financial behalf of for-profit businesses. Whatever Energy Pioneer's good intentions about energy efficiency, its purpose is to make money for these friends of Bill and Hill.
Even more curious, details about the Energy Pioneer investment were stripped from the CGI website a few months later. The Clinton Foundation says this was done at the request of the Canadian investor -- Ms. Samuel -- but the Journal quotes sources who say the information was hidden ""to avoid calling attention to Mr. Clinton's friendship"" with Ms. McMahon. You don't have to be Ken Starr to understand that motivation.
The Clinton Foundation is now promising to revamp its disclosure policy, but we have seen this duck and cover before. The Foundation also failed to post details of contributions it received from foreign governments and businesses while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State -- until those donations were exposed in media reports last year.
There's more. The Journal reports that Mr. Clinton also talked to then-Energy Secretary Steven Chu about a federal grant for Energy Pioneer. Mr. Chu says he doesn't recall the conversation, but his department gave the company $812,000 in taxpayer funds in 2010.
The Energy Department had no comment on the Journal story, perhaps because Pioneer Energy isn't doing well. The company lost at least $600,000 in its first 18 months, according to Energy Department audits. And the Journal reports that Mr. Kleeb recently ""laid off most of his staff, closed his offices, sold a fleet of trucks and changed his business strategy.""
What we have here is a crystalline illustration of the Clinton political business model. Stretch the nonprofit laws to help political friends, who help the Clintons in return. Use political influence to leverage cash from government for a supposedly virtuous cause that is also a for-profit venture. Then when this sleazy deal-making is exposed, claim that everybody does it and hope the media give them another pass.
Voters can't be sure of what they'll get if they vote for Mr. Trump this fall, but they certainly do know what they'll be getting if they vote for Mrs. Clinton. More crony capitalism, ethical corner-cutting and self-serving political deals.

"Dissidents Silenced, GOP Convention Turns Attacks on Clinton; Move by some delegates to change convention rules highlights the divisions within the party",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805168946?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND--On the first night of Donald Trump's convention, Republicans assailed Hillary Clinton for the 2012 attack on Benghazi, illegal immigration and recent killings of police officers they said were the result of societal breakdowns caused by feckless leadership in Washington.
At the same time, Mr. Trump's campaign and its Republican National Committee allies presided over the most chaotic scene at a national party convention in generations, with hundreds of delegates shouting for a roll-call vote to disrupt his forthcoming nomination and one state delegation walking off the floor.
Mr. Trump's campaign dismissed the midafternoon disruption as the last gasp of a shrinking number of intraparty opponents. But Kendal Unruh, a leading anti-Trump delegate, said the schisms are now worse. ""They chose to divide and try to conquer. He didn't unify the party,"" Mrs. Unruh said.
Near the close of the evening, Mr. Trump emerged from a darkened stage to introduce his wife, Melania, as the Queen anthem, ""We Are the Champions,"" pumped through the arena's speakers. As he does, Mr. Trump predicted victory. ""We're going to win so big, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to win so big,"" he said.
Upon taking the stage, Mrs. Trump said her husband was honored to be the GOP's choice for president and testified to his patriotic commitment.
""I can tell you with certainty that my husband has been concerned about our country for as long as I have known him,"" Mrs. Trump said. ""He will never, ever let you down.""
Earlier in the evening session, delegates heard from mothers of U.S. officials killed in Benghazi and a father whose son was murdered by an undocumented immigrant. David Clarke, the African-American sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis., opened his remarks with a retort that ""blue lives matter,"" a reference to recent shootings of police officers.
The themes were aimed at undermining Mrs. Clinton's foreign policy experience and service as secretary of state. They also played to a Trump strength, as a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed voters think he would be tougher on the issue of terrorism by a slight margin.
Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in the attack at the embassy compound in Libya, accused Mrs. Clinton of being emotionally callous. ""I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son, personally,"" she said. ""I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead.""
Her address left some delegates in tears. Yet, in another sign of the undisciplined nature of Mr. Trump's candidacy, he called into the Fox News Channel at the same moment to criticize Ohio Gov. John Kasich, his former GOP primary rival, for skipping the convention.
""From the standpoint of honor he probably should show up,"" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Kasich laughed off such barbs from Mr. Trump's campaign earlier in the day.
The lack of unity for Mr. Trump's nomination was on full display when the convention convened to vote on the reports of its rules and platform committees. Delegates who have sought for months to deny him the nomination found themselves silenced on key procedural votes.
The final blow to the stop-Trump movement came when Republican National Committee staffers, allied with Trump campaign whips, beat back an effort to conduct a roll-call vote on the party's rules. Delegates seeking to unseat Mr. Trump had hoped the convention would reject the rules adopted last week and allow delegates to vote their conscience.
Hundreds of delegates, including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, shouted their disapproval, chanting ""roll call vote."" Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, who was presiding over the convention, instead announced based on a voice vote that the ""ayes"" had it and the party's rules were approved.
Mr. Womack left the stage, announcing that the rules had been adopted. The Colorado delegation, which included many of the leaders of the anti-Trump rebellion, walked out of the arena as Mr. Trump's backers shouted ""U-S-A"" and support for Mr. Trump.
The ruling left the leaders of the stop-Trump group furious. Gary Emineth, a North Dakota delegate who was a state fundraising chairman for the Joint Victory Fund raising money for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, told reporters he was resigning his post. Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli slammed his credentials to the ground as he walked off the floor.
Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, speaking on CNN, dismissed the dispute. ""This was not about Trump. The conscious vote and the unbind vote were defeated handily,"" he said.
Party leaders hoped stopping a roll-call vote on the rules would spare the GOP from a clear demonstration of disunity. But the scene on the floor may have turned out to be worse.
""The unruly, uncivilized spectacle we witnessed was the Trump presidency in prototype,"" said former New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a fierce Trump critic. ""Many of his supporters, if they are not fascists, acted very much like fascists. They shouted us down, they allowed no debate, no points of order, no questions, no roll-call vote.""
It was never likely that the renegade delegates had sufficient backing to reject the rules, but RNC member Randy Evans of Georgia estimated there were at least 400 delegates who would have voted against the rules package. Stop-Trump delegates were hopeful they could get closer to a 1,237-delegate majority required to block adoption of the rules.
In the end, the sheer political muscle employed by the Trump campaign and the RNC dashed those hopes. A group called Delegates Unbound produced majorities from nine delegations seeking a roll-call vote, meeting the threshold to trigger such action, but Trump aides quickly circulated, pressing a majority of the delegates in three states to rescind their support, Mr. Womack said.
Even on smaller tactical measures, the delegates aiming to block Mr. Trump were outmaneuvered. Eric O'Keefe, the leader of the largest group seeking to unbind delegates from Mr. Trump, brought to the convention 1,200 lime green hats for anti-Trump delegates to wear on the convention floor.
But when delegates arrived at Quicken Loans Arena, they found delegate whips working for Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee already wearing hats of the exact same color, foiling their plan.

"Donald Trump Accepts GOP Nomination, Promises to Fix America; Republican nominee amps up attack on Hillary Clinton, says he is ready to lead during 'moment of crisis'",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805977664?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump ended his party's convention Thursday the way he began his history-making campaign: attacking the political establishment, playing to voters' fears of foreigners and crime, and making bold promises to fix America's ills.
""I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves,"" said the first-time politician whose populist message helped him capture the Republican presidential nomination.
The speech, which ran more than an hour, painted a grim view of the U.S. economy and world affairs under President Barack Obama, and intensified the attack on the record of his rival Hillary Clinton.
""This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,"" he said.
He returned to familiar campaign themes of opposing international trade deals and cracking down on illegal immigration. He drew strong applause when he reiterated his desire to ban immigrants from nations ""compromised by terrorism,"" and departed from his prepared text to say, ""We don't want them in our country.""
He homed in on Mrs. Clinton, the one issue sure to galvanize Republicans in November. Arguing that her tenure as secretary of state under Mr. Obama fomented instability abroad, he said, ""America is far less safe--and the world is far less stable--than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy,"" he said. ""I am certain it is a decision President Barack Obama truly regrets.""
Mr. Trump's speech was the capstone of a tumultuous convention that exposed some of the risks he faces as he takes his unorthodox campaign into a general election campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's well-funded and well-oiled machine.
Mr. Trump presented himself as uniquely equipped to lead the nation.
""Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,"" he said.
Citing recent episodes of gun violence and attacks on police officers, he put fresh emphasis on law and order.
""Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored,"" he said. ""The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threaten our communities.""
Mr. Trump's message has been honed before oversize crowds on the primary campaign trail. It is less clear how it will play in a tough general election ahead with a broader audience of swing voters. Testing that was one of the chief convention goals, along with trying to unite the party and broaden Mr. Trump's personal profile.
The stakes for Mr. Trump's speech rose in the wake of the missteps that marred the first days of the convention: the repeated passages in Melania Trump's speech from one delivered eight years earlier by Michelle Obama, a divisive fight over convention rules, and the chaos that erupted after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's refused to endorse Mr. Trump during a prime-time address Wednesday.
""If you can't run a convention, how is he going to run a State Department, or the Pentagon?"" said Rick Tyler, former aide to the Cruz presidential campaign. ""The dominant message coming out of the convention is 'You may not like Donald Trump, but he is not Hillary Clinton.' If that's the dominant message, we've already lost.""
Mrs. Clinton will be officially nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate next week in Philadelphia.
Trump allies dismiss the long-term significance of the tumult surrounding Mr. Cruz's actions, saying the nominee may have been strengthened because of the backlash against the Texas senator. ""The person who shrinks after last night is Cruz not Trump,"" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who said the choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as Trump's running mate should help build bridges to disaffected conservatives.
Gabriel N. Schwartz, a Trump supporter from Colorado, said he was confident that most Cruz dissidents are in the minority of the party and that Republicans will come around to vote Trump in November. ""What the convention doesn't do to unify the GOP, Hillary Clinton will,'' he said.
The Trump campaign used the GOP convention to showcase his family, which is considered one of his biggest assets--and a potential antidote to one of his biggest political liabilities as he scores particularly low with women voters.
The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that among suburban women, a key swing voting bloc, 66% say they would be pessimistic or uncertain if he were elected president; among independents, it is 73%.
His wife, sons and daughters all tried to present a softer image of Mr. Trump. And the appearance of his eldest daughter on the final night was intended to signal to young women that the businessman wants everyone to succeed.
In her introduction of her father, Ivanka Trump sought to counter suggestions that he is a sexist, saying that he believes in wage equality and that there are more female than male executives in his company. ""He hires the best person for the job. Period,"" said Ms. Trump.
Yet the speeches by the Trump family offered only brief testimonials to their father's personal attributes before launching into themes that echoed his addresses at rallies.
Mr. Trump has relied heavily on his family as advisers and surrogates; Mr. Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are Mr. Trump's most reliable outside advisers. But if their speeches are any indication, most of the party's heavy hitters are less inclined to make a robust case for Mr. Trump than they are to make the case against Mrs. Clinton.
House Speaker Paul Ryan devoted more time to advancing his conservative vision for the party than to promoting Mr. Trump's virtues. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell mentioned Mr. Trump just five times and Mrs. Clinton more than a dozen times.

"Pence Offers Upbeat Outlook on Rocky Night at GOP Convention; Ted Cruz refuses to endorse Donald Trump, but speakers unite in rally against Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805652088?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND--Indiana Gov. Mike Pence accepted the Republican vice presidential nomination Wednesday night in a prime-time address that was overshadowed by lingering fissures inside the party.
On a night dominated by the refusal of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to endorse Donald Trump, the task fell to Mr. Pence to deliver a forceful argument on behalf of the Republican nominee, urging GOP voters to support a candidate whose style and politics are night and day from his own.
""While Donald Trump was taking my measure as a possible running mate, I did some observing myself,"" Mr. Pence said. ""He can be a little rough with politicians on the stage and I bet we see that again. But I've seen this good man up close, his utter lack of pretense, his respect for the people who work for him and his devotion to his family.""
The Indiana governor headlined a night that also showcased three of Mr. Trump's primary rivals--Mr. Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker--in an effort to rally the still-fractured party behind Mr. Trump.
Mr. Pence took his first major step into the national spotlight Wednesday night in a measured, upbeat tone, describing his own introduction to Mr. Trump as he vaulted into the 2016 campaign earlier this month. He worked to sharpen the contrast between Mr. Trump and his rival, Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, whom he called the ""secretary of status quo.""
""At the very moment when America is crying out for something new and different, the other party has answered with a stale agenda and the most predictable of names,"" Mr. Pence said.
The Republican nominee picked Mr. Pence over New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who are both closer to Mr. Trump and share his more flamboyant style, because he presents an understated contrast to the nominee who can appeal to the conservative voters who have still not warmed to the New York businessman.
""We don't need two Donald Trumps out there,"" Donald Trump Jr. said Wednesday at a breakfast sponsored by The Wall Street Journal.
In his acceptance speech, Mr. Pence joked, ""He's a man known for a large personality, a colorful style and lots of charisma, so I guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket.""
Mr. Pence must prove his utility to the ticket by closing the sale with fence-sitting conservatives who still harbor doubts about the Republican nominee's convictions, rhetoric or vision for the country. He's also expected to take on the traditional running-mate role of going after the Democratic opposition.
""In the end, this election just comes down to just two names on the ballot, so let's resolve right now that Hillary Clinton will never become president of the United States of America,"" Mr. Pence said.
The Indiana governor drew favorable reviews from delegates in Quicken Loans Arena. Steve Toth, a Texas delegate, said Mr. Pence ""hit it out of the park. He set himself up as a real leader of the party. He drew a stark contrast between where we have been and where we are going. ""
Ying Ma, deputy director of a pro-Trump super PAC, said the speech was ""excellent.""
""The governor has a sense of humor. He's not flashy but he got the job done. It was clear the Reaganesque moment belonged to him. ""
In addition to balancing the GOP ticket with a larger-than-life outsider and an earnest insider, Mr. Pence impressed the Trump campaign with his knowledge of Congress and willingness to buck the system when he was in the House.
Messrs. Ryan and Pence occasionally locked horns with GOP leaders over budget reforms and other spending concerns. The former Indiana congressman was also among the most vocal opponents of abortion rights, gay marriage and the use of embryonic stem cells for research.
Mr. Pence ""helps bridge the different parts of the conservative movement,"" said Mr. Ryan, who has endorsed Mr. Trump but called him ""not my kind of conservative"" here in Cleveland.
Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican locked in a tight re-election fight, said he was ""encouraged"" by the selection. Mr. Toomey hasn't so far endorsed Mr. Trump.
""That's the single biggest decision he made in this campaign, and he made a very good one,"" Mr. Toomey said in an interview Wednesday, calling Mr. Pence a ""very principled, thoughtful conservative.""
Vice-presidential picks don't typically have a huge impact on the overall success of the ticket. That is particularly true this year when voters have uniquely strong views about the presidential candidates, the two least-popular major-party nominees in recent history.
Some 74% of all registered voters said Mr. Trump's decision to pick Mr. Pence would have no bearing on which candidate they support in November, according to a national Gallup survey of 901 registered voters. That's right in line with the last two vice presidents--Joe Biden in 2008 and Dick Cheney in 2000.
However, Mr. Pence is relatively unknown. Just 39% of voters know the Indiana governor well enough to form an opinion of him. Only former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was less well-known when Arizona Sen. John McCain plucked her out of obscurity to become his running mate during the 2008 race. She quickly became a major flashpoint in the race.
Mr. Trump made a dramatic arrival in Cleveland on Wednesday afternoon, taking a short helicopter from a Cleveland lakefront airport to a nearby rally. He was greeted by Mr. Pence and his family and the Republican ticket made very brief remarks before mingling with the crowd.
""What begins in Cleveland will end in the White House,"" Mr. Pence said.

Election 2016: Clinton Hints at the Role Her Husband Would Play,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789135713?accountid=12768,"PADUCAH, Ky. -- Hillary Clinton leaned hard on her husband's popularity in Kentucky as she worked to win Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary here, repeatedly invoking his presidency and promising he would have a role in her administration.
""I want to help bring back the kind of economy that worked for everybody in the 1990s,"" she told more than 100 people crammed into a diner here Monday. ""I've already told my husband that if I'm so fortunate enough to be president and he will be the first gentlemen, I'll expect him to go to work. . .to get incomes rising.""
Bill Clinton won the state twice, and headlined six events of his own in the run-up to the primary. Warm feelings for him were palpable. At the diner stop, Mrs. Clinton ran into one man wearing a vintage 1992 Clinton-Gore sweatshirt. ""Boy, that's an original,"" she told him.
No Democrat running for president has won Kentucky since 1996, and the Clinton campaign has no plans to compete here this fall. But the state has taken on a more prominent role in the Democratic race as Mrs. Clinton works to show strength in the final stretch of her primary contest against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Mrs. Clinton won the state in 2008 and both campaigns see it competitive now. They also agree Mr. Sanders is likely to win Tuesday in Oregon. Mrs. Clinton maintains a significant delegate lead that would likely withstand continued losses, but primary wins would deliver some momentum heading into the summer.
Republican Donald Trump is also on the Tuesday ballots, but with his nomination all but wrapped up, he was off the campaign trail.
Both Clintons have long suggested that if she is elected, Mr. Clinton would have a role advising her on the economy. The former first lady raised some eyebrows Sunday, when she appeared to go further, saying he would be ""in charge"" of economic revitalization. Aides later said no particular role had been discussed for him.
Mrs. Clinton also trained her focus on the fall contest against Mr. Trump. She asked voters to imagine a debate between the two of them, and mockingly mimicked him promising to create jobs without saying how. ""Maybe in the preliminaries, like the Republican primary, that's all they want to hear, but Americans take their vote for president seriously,"" she said in Bowling Green. ""I think we know a little bit about how to create jobs. I think my husband did a heck of a job.""
Also Monday, a super PAC backing her campaign, Priorities USA, said it would begin airing TV ads aimed at Mr. Trump in four battleground states, beginning Wednesday. The group bought $6 million in ad time for spots to run through June 8. This is on top of $130 million the group already planned to spend starting next month on TV, digital and radio spots.

"Election 2016: Clintons' GOP Embrace --- Former president, in stump speeches, uses some old antagonists to vouch for his wife",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785911091?accountid=12768,"ALBANY, N.Y. -- Bill Clinton tussled with Republicans throughout his White House years. Now, he is using some of his old antagonists to vouch for his wife.
The ex-president has been mentioning everyone from local Republicans to former congressional leaders who sought to drive him from office in his second term: Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay. Mr. Clinton's point is that in an era of fierce partisanship, even the most hard-bitten Republicans liked Hillary Clinton and worked constructively with her.
How do these Republicans feel about popping up in Mr. Clinton's speeches? Some are thrilled he is dropping their names; others say the stories are a bit embellished. In one case, it is a mystery as to whom Mr. Clinton is referring while seeking to cast congressional Republicans as friendlier than they appear.
Mr. Clinton has made about 250 appearances on behalf of his wife. He typically promotes Mrs. Clinton's credentials, discusses the broader political landscape and trumpets his own record.A recurring theme is Republicans who respect and like the former first lady, senator and secretary of state.
One person who has figured prominently in Mr. Clinton's remarks is Mr. DeLay, a former House GOP leader from Texas. As Mr. Clinton tells it, when she was first lady, Mrs. Clinton asked Mr. DeLay if he would help pass legislation aimed at moving children from foster care into permanent homes. Knowing that Mr. DeLay disliked her husband, Mrs. Clinton appealed to him on family grounds, the story goes.
In a speech in Albany, Mr. Clinton said of Mr. DeLay: ""He couldn't stand me.""
""She said, 'Congressman, I know we don't agree on much.' He said, 'Come on, Hillary? Do we agree on anything?' She said, 'Yes we do. You love your kids, don't you? . . . For all our disagreements, I know you adopted those children and I honor you for it.'
""And she sort of had him,"" Mr. Clinton said.
And so Mr. DeLay agreed to produce legislation that increased the number of children adopted from foster-care homes, Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. DeLay takes issue with Mr. Clinton's suggestion that it took Mrs. Clinton's intervention to get him on board, saying foster care ""was my issue to begin with!""
Mr. DeLay has in the past praised Mrs. Clinton's work on behalf of foster children. Asked his view of Mr. Clinton's telling the story on the trail, Mr. DeLay said: ""Who can explain Bill Clinton?""
Mr. Clinton declined to comment.
Mr. Gingrich, a former Republican House speaker, once served with Mrs. Clinton, when she was a New York senator, on a panel offering advice on transforming the U.S. military.
""If you elect her president, you will never have to worry there's somebody she won't see,"" Mr. Clinton said in Omaha, Neb.
Mr. Gingrich said he is ""always flattered to have a former president speak about me in non-attack mode.""
Of Mrs. Clinton, he said: ""I think she'd be an effective president,"" even as he ""would disagree with her a lot.""
Also figuring in a number of Clinton speeches is Joe Gergela. He was executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau, an advocacy group, for 26 years until retiring in 2014.
In Syracuse, N.Y., Mr. Clinton said Mr. Gergela told the media that even though he was a Republican, Mrs. Clinton ""is the only politician who actually did something for us.""
Mr. Gergela said he is a fan of the Clintons. But asked if she was indeed the only elected official who delivered for farmers, he paused.
""It's a little bit of a paraphrase,"" he said, adding that other U.S. and state officials were helpful, too.
In Nebraska, the former president created some head-scratching when he said that when he asked a former Senate Republican leader whether he truly believed the Clintons did anything wrong in the Whitewater land deals in Arkansas that became a focus of congressional investigations, the man laughed and said, ""Of course, you didn't.""
Asked who that was, aides said Mr. Clinton wasn't talking about a specific senator but was making the broader point that Republicans unfairly targeted his presidency.

Clinton in Tight Race In Kentucky; Sanders Wins Oregon,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789404815?accountid=12768,"LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Hillary Clinton held a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders late Tuesday in Kentucky's Democratic presidential primary, a result that blunted the Vermont senator's latest burst of momentum and likely thwarted his hopes of putting together a winning streak in the final state contests.
With 99% of precincts reporting, Mrs. Clinton led her Democratic rival by less than 1 percentage point there.
She declared victory on Twitter. ""We just won Kentucky!"" she tweeted. ""Thanks to everyone who turned out. We're always stronger united.""
Mr. Sanders won the Democratic primary in Oregon, the other state voting Tuesday, and Donald Trump won the Republican primary there. The New York businessman won the Kentucky GOP caucuses on March 5.
The decision by Mrs. Clinton to invest both time and resources in Kentucky paid dividends by moving her closer to securing her party's nomination and underscored the virtually impossible task Mr. Sanders faces in trying to chip away at his rival's advantage.
Still, Mr. Sanders told supporters in California Tuesday night that his campaign has ""a real shot to win"" several of the remaining Democratic contests. ""We are in until the last ballot is cast,"" he said.
While Mrs. Clinton has amassed a nearly insurmountable lead in the Democratic race, she has been lumbering toward the finish line while being forced to simultaneously fend off attacks from Messrs. Sanders and Trump.
There were 116 Democratic delegates up for grabs Tuesday, 55 in Kentucky and 61 in Oregon, all of which will be distributed proportionally.
Heading into Tuesday's contests, Mrs. Clinton had 2,240 of the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, when both pledged delegates and superdelegates were tallied, leaving her just 143 delegates shy of victory. Mr. Sanders had a combined total of 1,473, which meant the only way he could catch her would be to amass a large number of superdelegates.
So far, the Vermont senator has had little luck in persuading those elected officials and party leaders, who are free to back any candidate, to rally behind his candidacy.
That challenge likely becomes more difficult now after his supporters, angry over the handling of delegate allocation at a Nevada convention on Saturday, issued death threats to the state's party chairwoman. The messages were so vicious that Nevada officials filed a complaint with the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Sanders in a statement Tuesday condemned ""any and all forms of violence,"" but defended his supporters and railed against the party process for picking a nominee. The Democratic Party ""can open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change -- people who are willing to take on Wall Street, corporate greed and a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. Or the party can choose to maintain its status quo structure,"" he said.
In an effort to stall Mr. Sanders's momentum, Mrs. Clinton made three trips to Kentucky, visiting churches, holding small-group discussions, shaking hands at an overflowing diner and headlining a half-dozen rallies. She pitched herself as the best candidate to manage the nation's challenges, including national security and what she characterized as Mr. Trump's ""reckless"" approach to issues.
Her campaign spent about $300,000 on TV ads, compared with about $100,000 for the Vermont senator, a Sanders aide said. Clinton aides said that was partly because they saw the state as winnable and partly because ad time in Kentucky is inexpensive. The Clinton campaign's investment in Kentucky marked a change in strategy after she all but ceded Indiana, where Mr. Sanders won by 5 percentage points, and West Virginia, where his margin of victory was almost 16 points.
Mr. Sanders spent four days in Kentucky and continued to argue that he would be a stronger general-election candidate and a tougher foe for the New York businessman.
""In virtually every national poll and in statewide polls we do better against Donald Trump than Secretary Clinton. We're seeing that all over the country,"" he said during a campaign stop in Kentucky. ""Secretary Clinton does very well with Democrats and so do I, but there are a lot of independents in the country and we do very well with independents,"" he said.
Voters in the state reveled at the chance to size up the candidates so late in the primary process. The last contest is June 14 in Washington, D.C., a week after California, New Jersey and other states hold primaries or caucuses.
""I really appreciate what she's done for our country and what she will do,"" Mollijean Frazier said of Mrs. Clinton. The retired schoolteacher was among a crush of people greeting Mrs. Clinton at a Paducah diner Monday morning. ""I think Bernie Sanders's people are looking for something that's not going to happen, sort of pie in the sky.""
In Louisville, Shea Stephens said she planned to cast a ballot for Mr. Sanders. ""I can't find anything wrong with the man,"" said the 42-year-old technical account manager.
Ms. Stephens said Mrs. Clinton ""is the epitome of everything I do not like in politics.""
Mrs. Clinton came to Kentucky with some distinct advantages. She easily won the state in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. The state's rules limit participation to registered Democrats, excluding the independent voters who have favored Mr. Sanders all year.
Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who campaigned separately for her, won the state twice and remains popular. During her appearances, she repeatedly invoked his economic record and promised to put him to work helping to revive the economy.
There was concern, though, in the Clinton camp that the electorate would include conservative Democrats who would cast their ballots against Mrs. Clinton, and therefore for Mr. Sanders. That appeared to be the case last week in West Virginia. She faced other headwinds, including fallout from a comment earlier this year when, in the course of discussing a plan to help coal communities, she predicted that her energy agenda would put a lot of coal miners out of work.

Election 2016: Clintons' Speech Income Is $6.7 Million in Past 16 Months,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789404591?accountid=12768,"Bill and Hillary Clinton have earned $6.7 million from paid speeches since the beginning of 2015, including $2.7 million from speeches the former president gave after his wife kicked off her White House bid last April, according to a financial-disclosure form Mrs. Clinton's campaign released on Tuesday.
Mr. Clinton was paid $285,000 to speak to America's Health Insurance Plans, the trade association for health insurers, in June 2015. He was paid $200,000 to speak at Stephens Inc., an Arkansas financial-services firm. And in September 2015, he was paid $225,000 to speak to Computer Design & Integration LLC, a New Jersey information technology firm.
Mrs. Clinton stopped giving paid speeches when she started her 2016 campaign, and Mr. Clinton hasn't given any since a November 2015 event in Toronto, according to the form. He has said he didn't think he would continue to give paid speeches if Mrs. Clinton became president.
In addition to the speech income, Mrs. Clinton received more than $5 million in book royalties since the beginning of 2015, and Mr. Clinton was paid by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, an education charity, and Laureate Education Inc., a for-profit company. Mr. Clinton isn't required to reveal his exact earnings from that consulting work. The couple hasn't yet released their 2015 tax returns, though they have released decades of past returns.
The financial disclosure covers the period from Jan. 1, 2015 to present.
The Clintons' reported wealth is at least $11.3 million and as much as $52.7 million. The federal government requires candidates to report their wealth only in broad ranges.
Their largest assets are a cash account at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and an index fund at Vanguard Group, each with between $5 million and $25 million.
The couple's reported wealth doesn't include their homes in New York and Washington, D.C., the value of their public pensions and any federal defined-contribution retirement accounts.

What If Clinton Gets Indicted?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789696581?accountid=12768,"Despite losing the Oregon primary while barely eking out a win in Kentucky, Hillary Clinton emerged with 51 of Tuesday's delegates to Bernie Sanders's 55. To reach the 2,383 needed for the nomination, Mrs. Clinton now needs only 92 of either the 890 still-to-be-elected delegates or the 148 still-unpledged superdelegates. This is because she is already supported by 524 superdelegates -- the Democratic Party's unelected overclass -- to Mr. Sanders's 40.
Still, she must be concerned about losing the FBI primary. If the bureau recommends that the Justice Department indict Mrs. Clinton or close aides like Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin or Jake Sullivan for acting with gross negligence -- disregard of known or easily anticipated risks -- in sending classified information over a private email server, the campaign could be completely scrambled.
The FBI may not recommend indictments, or the Justice Department could refuse to issue them. The latter could result in high-profile resignations like those in 1973 with the Watergate ""Saturday Night Massacre,"" when several top Nixon officials were fired or resigned. Only this time, the turmoil would be covered on cable TV and in high-def.
If there are indictments, Team Clinton will dismiss them as an overreaction to unintentional, minor mistakes and try pushing on through. But that may be unacceptable to the party's hierarchy, especially if indictments occur before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia opens July 25.
The party establishment might balk at having the ticket led by someone mired in a national-security scandal or by Mr. Sanders, a socialist and independent who has never before sought election as a Democrat or attended a state or national convention.
Instead, the party establishment might move to replace Mrs. Clinton with Vice President Joe Biden, a sentimental favorite, or Secretary of State John Kerry, whom many in the party's leadership think more substantive, less prone to gaffes and, because of his 2004 loss against President George W. Bush, more deserving.
The legally unbound superdelegates hold the balance of power. Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Sanders can get the nomination without their votes. And the rest of the Democratic delegates, unlike their Republican counterparts, aren't bound by state laws or party rules to vote for the candidate they were pledged to in their state's primary for a certain number of ballots.
The Democratic National Committee's Rule 12.J. simply says: ""Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them."" So superdelegates could deadlock the convention until enough Clinton and Sanders supporters are willing to discard their original choices and swing the convention to a substitute.
What happens, however, if Mrs. Clinton or someone in her inner circle is indicted after the convention? The Democratic leadership could move to replace her on the ticket. Presumably this would require her to agree to resign as the nominee and be replaced either by a snap convention or by the Democratic National Committee acting on the party's behalf. Mrs. Clinton wouldn't give up easily -- she and her husband have brazenly pressed through previous scandals.
Even if she agreed to step down, Democrats would have only a narrow window to act. While many states allow election officials to place major-party nominees on the ballot at their discretion, at least 25 states set deadlines for parties to formally certify nominees.
According to a summary by the National Association of Secretaries of State, Texas and Michigan have the earliest deadlines -- the first business day after the Democratic convention's adjournment. That would be July 29 or Aug. 1, depending on the hour of adjournment. Ten other states have certification deadlines sprinkled across the month of August, from Delaware on Aug. 2 to Utah on Aug. 31. These dozen states have a total of 150 Electoral College votes.
What if Democrats act after certifying Hillary Clinton on the ballot in early-deadline states, and then make Mr. Biden or Mr. Kerry the nominee everywhere else? It could then be virtually impossible for them to win the presidency outright, especially since six early-deadline states (Alabama, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Virginia) have ""faithless elector laws"" that compel electors to support the popular-vote winner. The best possible outcome for Democrats then might be to kick the election to the House of Representatives by denying Donald Trump an electoral-college majority.
An indictment of any higher-up in Clinton World would produce a royal mess for Democrats. You can bet there are wise strategists in a backroom somewhere gaming this out, just in case.

Election 2016: Clinton Fights for a Win in Kentucky --- The Democrat looks to snap Sander's streak while keeping an eye on Republican Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789005959?accountid=12768,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Democrat Hillary Clinton made a final push in Kentucky ahead of Tuesday's presidential primary, looking to snap a losing streak against Sen. Bernie Sanders while battling a second front against Republican Donald Trump.
After all but conceding the past couple contests, Mrs. Clinton mounted a real campaign here. By Tuesday she is scheduled to have appeared at 11 events over three trips, including her visits to a pair of African-American churches Sunday morning. Her campaign also was on the air with TV ads.
Mr. Sanders also campaigned this weekend in Kentucky, hoping to build on back-to-back wins in Indiana and West Virginia. Both campaigns said Kentucky was more competitive than Tuesday's other contest, in Oregon, where Mr. Sanders is favored.
A two-state defeat might not meaningfully change Mrs. Clinton's delegate advantage, but it would be embarrassing for her to continue losing states and further proof that a substantial slice of Democrats aren't satisfied with her as the nominee and are drawn to Mr. Sanders's more populist message.
It also would put off the day when Democrats can begin uniting around one nominee, as some in the fractured Republican Party are trying to do around Mr. Trump.
On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton's double-edge challenge was on display. At a rally at a union training facility, she hit Mr. Trump for his ""reckless"" and ""scary, dangerous"" approach to national security. She said his comments on the economy, such as his suggestion that wages are too high, are ""just frightening."" A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't respond to a request for comment.
She also revived a hit on Mr. Sanders's vote in 2009 against bailout funds for the U.S. auto industry. Pointing to the industry's revival, she said, ""I think I came out on the better side of that.""
Mr. Sanders has said he voted against the legislation because it also included a bailout of Wall Street firms that he opposed.
For his part, Mr. Sanders emphasized his better showing in polling of hypothetical matchups against Mr. Trump in an appeal to superdelegates -- party leaders who can support whomever they like for the nomination. So far it hasn't worked to win them over.
""In virtually every national poll and in statewide polls, we do better against Donald Trump than Secretary Clinton. We're seeing that all over the country,"" he said in Paducah, Ky., where Mrs. Clinton planned to campaign on Monday.
The Vermont senator is likely too far behind in the delegate race to win the nomination, even if he continues winning states, but he is continuing to vigorously challenge Mrs. Clinton. In Kentucky, 55 delegates are stake, and they will be awarded proportionately, meaning in a close contest they would be roughly divided.
The Clinton campaign has written off Oregon as unwinnable but opted to compete for Kentucky, a state she easily won in 2008. After spending nothing on TV ads in Indiana or West Virginia, the Clinton camp bought about $300,000 worth in Kentucky, about three times what Mr. Sanders bought, according to a Sanders adviser.
""We're spending where we believe we can have an impact,"" said Joel Benenson, a senior Clinton strategist.
Mr. Sanders has spent a total of four days in Kentucky, including rallies, stops at field offices and an impromptu photo op Saturday with teenagers headed to their prom.
The state limits the Democratic primary to registered Democrats, a rule that typically favors Mrs. Clinton. Still, there is some concern in the Clinton campaign that the electorate will include conservative Democrats who will cast their ballots against Mrs. Clinton, and therefore for Mr. Sanders.
Mrs. Clinton faces fallout from a comment earlier this year when, in the course of discussing a plan to help coal communities, she predicted that her energy agenda would put a lot of coal miners out of work. Miners angry about those comments protested a Bill Clinton rally last week, booing as he took the stage.
She appealed to miners and their families at a rally in Fort Mitchell in northern Kentucky on Sunday, saying ""we must not walk away from them"" as the nation transitions to cleaner sources of energy.
""We lost 120,000 miners in the 20th century. Think about that. [They] went down in those mines, generation after generation, lots of them got black lung [disease],"" she said. ""But they made it possible for us to industrialize, to turn on the lights, to power our factories.""

Hope Without Change; Clinton is promising better results from more of the same policies.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807429987?accountid=12768,"Democrats in Philadelphia extolled Hillary Rodham Clinton as a tireless warhorse with a lifetime of hard experience who also happens to be fresh and modern and historic. The contradiction shows how hard it is to sell a candidate who has been a national figure for 25 years when the public wants change.
The truth is that Mrs. Clinton accepted the nomination Thursday night as the most predictable Democrat in generations. Democrats have tended to nominate relative unknowns with strategically ambiguous goals, like Bill Clinton in 1992 or Barack Obama in 2008, who ran on hope and change and revealed his true ambitions in the White House.
By contrast, Mrs. Clinton has been clear. She wants to serve as Mr. Obama's political and policy heir, as she and he now admit. This won't mean ""change"" unless the Clintons have a unusual personal definition of that word, as they do for ""classified material."" A de facto third Obama term will mean the status quo, only more of it.
Also changeless will be Mrs. Clinton's political and private character. Voters have seen enough of this national figure since 1992 to understand how she cuts ethical corners and then stonewalls and dissembles when discovered. This is why some 68% of the country believes she isn't honest or trustworthy.
As divergent in temperament and worldview as Mrs. Clinton and Donald Trump are, her average unfavorable rating (55.4%) is nearly as high as his (56.9%). If voters do decide they're ""with her,"" no one can claim they didn't know what they were getting--the same policies that have produced slow growth and stagnant incomes, and no doubt more scandal.
***
This campaign has been so volatile for both parties because of pent-up frustration over slow growth. The Democratic establishment has responded by amplifying the same preoccupation with inequality that contributed to the inertia. Rather than the growth that allows everyone to rise, Democrats have doubled down on redistribution economics, high taxation and heavy regulation.
Mrs. Clinton's project is even more progressive than Mr. Obama's. Believe it or not, there are still subsidy gaps in the cradle-to-grave entitlement state, and this is a candidate who regularly talks about the programs she wants to create for ""ages 0 to 5.""
A partial list includes another burst of spending allegedly earmarked for public works; wage controls for higher federal minimum, overtime, family leave and ""equal"" pay; a right to child care; ""free"" college; a Medicare-like public health insurance option and administrative prices for new drugs; and nearly doubling the top tax rate on long-term capital gains to 43.4% from 23.8%. Anyone who thinks these policies will get better results than 2007-2016 hasn't paid attention.
Much of this could be blocked if the GOP holds the House. But Congress would matter less than it once did because Mrs. Clinton will attempt to govern through executive fiat as Mr. Obama has. In May she promised to extend the President's partial suspension of immigration law--blocked by the Supreme Court--to all illegal aliens ""with sympathetic cases if Congress refuses to act.""
The courts could stop some of this lawlessness, though they are increasingly stocked with progressive jurists who vote their political preferences. The Supreme Court will soon follow if Mrs. Clinton takes the White House.
Some of Mrs. Clinton's centrist supporters, and those who flinch from Mr. Trump, have convinced themselves she'd lead pragmatically, whatever her liberal campaign promises. Shrewdly, Mrs. Clinton is evoking the prosperity of the 1990s to win over such hope-over-experience voters.
But Bill Clinton ran as a centrist after the left had been chastened by three straight presidential defeats. Yet even then, in his first two years, Mr. Clinton raised income taxes and tried to impose a fossil fuels BTU tax and HillaryCare that Mrs. Clinton managed as ""co-President."" Her core political beliefs run closer to Mr. Obama's than to the New Democrats of the 1990s.
Then there are the scandals that always follow the Clintons. Hillary began her career with a near-1000% return on cattle futures brokered by an Arkansas crony. Thirty years later her Clinton Foundation received donations from foreign governments and business magnates while she was Secretary of State. Her private email server, about which she lied for months, potentially exposed state secrets to U.S. adversaries. The surest bet in politics is that there will be more such abuses if she and the Clinton menagerie regain the levers of executive power.
***
Democrats this week have made a theme of her experience on foreign policy, and the Commander in Chief test is an advantage given Mr. Trump's lack of knowledge and mercurial temperament. But what genuine achievements can she point to? As New York Senator, Mrs. Clinton voted for the Iraq war in 2003, then tried to prevent the 2007 surge when the political tide ran out. As Secretary of State, she helped to lead Mr. Obama's global retreat, which has left the world more dangerous than any time since the Cold War ended.
Mrs. Clinton took a flyer on Mr. Obama's failed Russian ""reset"" but now says Vladimir Putin is an existential foe. She championed the premature withdrawal of troops from Iraq that allowed Islamic State to develop, and her plan to defeat ISIS amounts to an assertion that she has a plan to defeat ISIS. She advocated invading Libya on the covert advice of her longtime plumber Sidney Blumenthal, who had been banned from the Administration by President Obama. Sid will be back as a Hillary counselor.
Mrs. Clinton's instincts are more hawkish than Mr. Obama's, and we would hope that as President she'd steer towards a more prudent realism. But she might also continue the opportunism she has shown on trade, abandoning the Pacific pact she helped craft to placate her liberal base.
***
In addition to inequality, the other Democratic obsession is identity politics. Mrs. Clinton would be the first woman President, if you haven't heard. We wonder if the appeal to reward this particular woman because she is a woman will succeed among non-Baby Boomer women and men who have grown up in a more egalitarian society.
Notwithstanding her invocation of optimism Thursday night, the sour public mood and Mrs. Clinton's unpopularity mean that to win she will have to run an unremittingly negative campaign that disqualifies Mr. Trump as unfit for the Oval Office. Americans may well decide that he isn't worth the risk. But though false hope springs eternal, they shouldn't underestimate the risks of a third Obama-Clinton term.

Election 2016: Clinton Declares She 'Will Be' Democratic Party's Nominee,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789941897?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton said the Democratic presidential race is effectively over and ""there is no way"" she won't be the party's nominee. She also said in a CNN interview Thursday that she is confident the party will unify before the general election, despite rival Bernie Sanders's pledge to keep fighting until the summer convention.
""I will be the nominee for my party,"" she told CNN. ""That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won't be.""
She also made it clear she expects Mr. Sanders to rally his backers behind her once the primaries end. She pointed to her own experience after losing the 2008 nomination to then-Sen. Barack Obama. ""I worked really hard to make the case, as I'm sure Senator Sanders will, that whatever differences we might have, they pale in comparison to the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party.""
Mr. Sanders campaign responded by saying ""voters in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton . . . it is clear that millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign.""
Mrs. Clinton has 1,768 pledged delegates, the type awarded by voters, and 525 superdelegates, party leaders who can back anyone they like, for a total of 2,293, which is 90 short of the total needed for the nomination. Mr. Sanders has 1,533 delegates.
In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has pivoted away from the primary battle and toward the general election and presumptive Republican opponent Donald Trump. Asked if she believed Mr. Trump is qualified to be president, she said, ""No, I do not,"" and cited his recent comments on British leaders, NATO and North Korea. Based on his comments and policies, ""I think it adds up to a very troubling picture,"" Mrs. Clinton said.
Mr. Trump tweeted this week that ""I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton!""

Trump Says Russia Remarks 'Sarcastic'; Republican presidential nominee says his comments inviting Russia to dig up Hillary Clinton's lost emails weren't meant to be taken literally,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807455362?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday said his comments inviting Russia to dig up Hillary Clinton's lost emails--which caused an uproar from much of the U.S. national-security community--weren't meant to be taken literally.
""Of course, I'm being sarcastic,"" Mr. Trump said during an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about fears that Russia might be meddling in the U.S. election, a top U.S. intelligence official on Thursday said Moscow could be seeking payback for what it viewed as concerted attempts by the U.S. to interfere in elections in Russia.
""They see a U.S. conspiracy behind every bush and ascribe far more impact than we're actually guilty of, but that's their mind-set,"" said U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking at a security conference in Aspen, Colo.
Mr. Clapper said U.S. intelligence agencies haven't reached a firm conclusion on whether Russia or any other country was behind the recent computer breach that stole emails and other records from the Democratic National Committee.
""I'll just say that don't think we're quite ready yet to make a call on attribution,"" Mr. Clapper said. ""I mean, we all know there are just a few usual suspects out there. But in terms of the process that we try to stick to, I don't think we're ready to make a public call yet.""
Close to 20,000 of those emails were released by WikiLeaks last week, a move that proved embarrassing to senior DNC officials because they involved plots in some cases to undermine the presidential candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned after the emails were made public.
The remarks by the nation's top intelligence chief came as Mr. Trump rejected criticism of his invitation Wednesday to the Russian government to hack into the emails of Mrs. Clinton, his Democratic rival.
In the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""a better leader"" than President Barack Obama.
""He's a better leader than Obama, because Obama's not a leader, so he's certainly doing a better job than Obama is,"" Mr. Trump said.
Though Mr. Trump's invitation to the Russia government drew bipartisan criticism, the White House on Thursday said the GOP nominee would soon begin receiving classified intelligence briefings.
""The administration is confident that they can both provide relevant and sufficient briefings to the two major party presidential candidates, while also protecting sensitive national security information,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.
In response to a question about recent comments by Mr. Trump on foreign policy, particularly the U.S. relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the development of nuclear weapons in Asia, Mr. Clapper said he wouldn't offer any opinion. But he said he has heard concerns from his counterparts overseas based on rhetoric on the campaign trail. ""I can say with some authority that such statements, such rhetoric are very bothersome to our foreign interlocutors, our foreign partners,"" he said. ""I hear that from my counterparts, intelligence and security colleagues in many other countries who take very, very seriously and study very, very closely what political figures in this country say. And it is a worry to them, it really is. I'll just let it go at that...I think it's legitimate for me to report what I'm hearing from foreign partners and interlocutors.""

"Economy Buffets Presidential Election; Mixed economic signals complicate sharply different views of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807822689?accountid=12768,"The U.S. economy is flashing mixed signals heading toward November's election, complicating the narrative for both presidential campaigns in a race featuring sharply different views of the vitality of the seven-year expansion.
Historically, elections often hinge on popular perceptions of the economy's health, particularly those that solidify in the early summer of an election year. That puts a premium on economic gauges in June and July, be it on overall output, the pace of hiring or measures of consumer sentiment.
New figures out Friday showed U.S. gross domestic product, a broad measure of output, averaged a paltry 1% seasonally adjusted annual growth rate through the year's first half, well below historical norms. That has raised fears the economy is slowing heading into the election, with some economists warning of a possible recession by year end.
That would add a new headwind for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as she tries to fend off Republican contender Donald Trump, since her campaign in part is based on praising the success fellow Democrat President Barack Obama has had in rejuvenating the economy since 2009. Research shows voters can take a dimmer view of incumbent parties when the economy is underperforming.
At the same time, other important measures, related to jobs, wages, consumer spending and consumer confidence, suggest a degree of resilience for the seven-year expansion, undercutting Mr. Trump's portrayal of an economy in dismal shape.
Economic ups and downs almost always play into presidential campaigns, as they did in 2012, when steady hiring aided Mr. Obama.
In the past three elections comparable to this one, in which a two-term president was stepping down--1988, 2000 and 2008--the state of the economy played a key role, but in highly unpredictable ways.
In 1988, George H.W. Bush won his first term, and the Republican Party's third consecutive term, in the White House. The economy, in the fifth year of a robust expansion, certainly helped.
GDP, for example, advanced at a 3.9% pace during the first half of that year, faster than the post-World War II average of about 3.2%.
The labor market also was expanding at a solid clip. Nonfarm payrolls grew by more than 3.4 million from mid-1987 to mid-1988.
By mid-1988, consumer spending had climbed 8% from a year earlier. (Currently it is up less than 4%.) The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed confidence on the rise.
In 2000, a vibrant economy failed to propel Al Gore into the White House, which would have been a third straight term for Democrats.
At the midpoint of 2000, GDP was averaging a 4.5% growth rate, the labor market had added close to three million jobs over the previous year, consumer spending was up 7.7% and consumer sentiment was coming off a record high.
Republican George W. Bush won the contested election by a whisker after a Supreme Court case over Florida vote counting was decided in his favor.
In mid-2008, the housing market was collapsing, Lehman Brothers was on the brink of bankruptcy and the economy was months into a deep, protracted recession. GDP contracted and the labor market was shedding jobs. While consumers continued to spend, confidence was in free fall. Mr. Obama defeated Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.).
How does the economy look now?
The biggest mark against the economy is found in the broadest measure of growth. GDP is up a meager 1% through the first half of the year, dragged down by a pullback in investment by companies, a drawdown in business inventories and slower government spending.
The labor market has been performing well, though not as well as the 1988 and 2000 cycles. Nonfarm payrolls are up by about 2.5 million over the past year, while the unemployment rate in June was 4.9%, compared with 5.4% in 1988, 4% in 2000 and 5.6% in 2008.
Consumers are offering a key support for the economy, with their spending up 3.7% from a year earlier. Consumer confidence is roughly in line with 1988 but well short of 2000 levels.
""The economy in terms of the growth rate of GDP is clearly not a plus for the Democrats in 2016,"" said Ray Fair, a Yale University professor who has written extensively on the economy's impact on elections. Tepid output combined with the electorate's tendency to vote out a two-term incumbent party are working against Mrs. Clinton, he said.
Based on his model, which isn't always right but did forecast a Bush victory in 1988, an Obama victory in 2008 and an election too close to call in 2000, Mrs. Clinton is poised to capture only about 45% of the vote come November.
Still, Mr. Fair said, 2016 is an unusual election and Mr. Trump an atypical candidate for the Republican Party.

Hope Without Change; Clinton is promising better results from more of the same policies.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807443747?accountid=12768,"Democrats in Philadelphia extolled Hillary Rodham Clinton as a tireless warhorse with a lifetime of hard experience who also happens to be fresh and modern and historic. The contradiction shows how hard it is to sell a candidate who has been a national figure for 25 years when the public wants change.
The truth is that Mrs. Clinton accepted the nomination Thursday night as the most predictable Democrat in generations. Democrats have tended to nominate relative unknowns with strategically ambiguous goals, like Bill Clinton in 1992 or Barack Obama in 2008, who ran on hope and change and revealed his true ambitions in the White House.
By contrast, Mrs. Clinton has been clear. She wants to serve as Mr. Obama's political and policy heir, as she and he now admit. This won't mean ""change"" unless the Clintons have an unusual personal definition of that word, as they do for ""classified material."" A de facto third Obama term will mean the status quo, only more of it.
Also changeless will be Mrs. Clinton's political and private character. Voters have seen enough of this national figure since 1992 to understand how she cuts ethical corners and then stonewalls and dissembles when discovered. This is why some 68% of the country believes she isn't honest or trustworthy.
As divergent in temperament and worldview as Mrs. Clinton and Donald Trump are, her average unfavorable rating (55.4%) is nearly as high as his (56.9%). If voters do decide they're ""with her,"" no one can claim they didn't know what they were getting--the same policies that have produced slow growth and stagnant incomes, and no doubt more scandal.
***
This campaign has been so volatile for both parties because of pent-up frustration over slow growth. The Democratic establishment has responded by amplifying the same preoccupation with inequality that contributed to the inertia. Rather than the growth that allows everyone to rise, Democrats have doubled down on redistribution economics, high taxation and heavy regulation.
Mrs. Clinton's project is even more progressive than Mr. Obama's. Believe it or not, there are still subsidy gaps in the cradle-to-grave entitlement state, and this is a candidate who regularly talks about the programs she wants to create for ""ages 0 to 5.""
A partial list includes another burst of spending allegedly earmarked for public works; wage controls for higher federal minimum, overtime, family leave and ""equal"" pay; a right to child care; ""free"" college; a Medicare-like public health insurance option and administrative prices for new drugs; and nearly doubling the top tax rate on long-term capital gains to 43.4% from 23.8%. Anyone who thinks these policies will get better results than 2007-2016 hasn't paid attention.
Much of this could be blocked if the GOP holds the House. But Congress would matter less than it once did because Mrs. Clinton will attempt to govern through executive fiat as Mr. Obama has. In May she promised to extend the President's partial suspension of immigration law--blocked by the Supreme Court--to all illegal aliens ""with sympathetic cases if Congress refuses to act.""
The courts could stop some of this lawlessness, though they are increasingly stocked with progressive jurists who vote their political preferences. The Supreme Court will soon follow if Mrs. Clinton takes the White House.
Some of Mrs. Clinton's centrist supporters, and those who flinch from Mr. Trump, have convinced themselves she'd lead pragmatically, whatever her liberal campaign promises. Shrewdly, Mrs. Clinton is evoking the prosperity of the 1990s to win over such hope-over-experience voters.
But Bill Clinton ran as a centrist after the left had been chastened by three straight presidential defeats. Yet even then, in his first two years, Mr. Clinton raised income taxes and tried to impose a fossil fuels BTU tax and HillaryCare that Mrs. Clinton managed as ""co-President."" Her core political beliefs run closer to Mr. Obama's than to the New Democrats of the 1990s.
Then there are the scandals that always follow the Clintons. Hillary began her career with a near-1000% return on cattle futures brokered by an Arkansas crony. Thirty years later her Clinton Foundation received donations from foreign governments and business magnates while she was Secretary of State. Her private email server, about which she lied for months, potentially exposed state secrets to U.S. adversaries. The surest bet in politics is that there will be more such abuses if she and the Clinton menagerie regain the levers of executive power.
***
Democrats this week have made a theme of her experience on foreign policy, and the Commander in Chief test is an advantage given Mr. Trump's lack of knowledge and mercurial temperament. But what genuine achievements can she point to? As New York Senator, Mrs. Clinton voted for the Iraq war in 2003, then tried to prevent the 2007 surge when the political tide ran out. As Secretary of State, she helped to lead Mr. Obama's global retreat, which has left the world more dangerous than any time since the Cold War ended.
Mrs. Clinton took a flyer on Mr. Obama's failed Russian ""reset"" but now says Vladimir Putin is an existential foe. She championed the premature withdrawal of troops from Iraq that allowed Islamic State to develop, and her plan to defeat ISIS amounts to an assertion that she has a plan to defeat ISIS. She advocated invading Libya on the covert advice of her longtime plumber Sidney Blumenthal, who had been banned from the Administration by President Obama. Sid will be back as a Hillary counselor.
Mrs. Clinton's instincts are more hawkish than Mr. Obama's, and we would hope that as President she'd steer towards a more prudent realism. But she might also continue the opportunism she has shown on trade, abandoning the Pacific pact she helped craft to placate her liberal base.
***
In addition to inequality, the other Democratic obsession is identity politics. Mrs. Clinton would be the first woman President, if you haven't heard. We wonder if the appeal to reward this particular woman because she is a woman will succeed among non-Baby Boomer women and men who have grown up in a more egalitarian society.
Notwithstanding her invocation of optimism Thursday night, the sour public mood and Mrs. Clinton's unpopularity mean that to win she will have to run an unremittingly negative campaign that disqualifies Mr. Trump as unfit for the Oval Office. Americans may well decide that he isn't worth the risk. But though false hope springs eternal, they shouldn't underestimate the risks of a third Obama-Clinton term.

Election 2016: Trump Is Slow to Organize in Key State --- Presumptive nominee lags behind Clinton in building team in Ohio; Kasich still on sideline,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790309428?accountid=12768,"PLAIN TOWNSHIP, Ohio -- Though Donald Trump dispensed with his last primary opponent months before Hillary Clinton will, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee trails far behind the leading Democrat in organizing in a key general-election state.
Ohio, which has backed every presidential winner since 1964, presents both Mr. Trump's best opportunity to carry a big swing state and reveals his team's steep logistical challenges.
Mr. Trump doesn't have any general-election staff in Ohio, and senior aides in New York and Washington haven't made contact with the state Republican Party. Efforts to recruit the state's experienced operatives who helped elect Gov. John Kasich have so far been unsuccessful, people familiar with the matter said.
Mrs. Clinton has a small team of full-time aides in Ohio, where they are working to rebuild the organization that twice carried the state for President Barack Obama.
""It's like we're all at ground zero,"" said Ed Rollins, who is co-chairman of the pro-Trump super PAC called the Great America PAC. ""I think we have a superior candidate. It's a question of whether you can build the resources.""
Mr. Trump's slow start, here and elsewhere, could undermine his goal of expanding the Republican presidential map into the industrial Midwest.
Ohio's electorate is tailor-made for Mr. Trump's populist message on immigration and trade. Among states that were competitive in the 2012 general election, only New Hampshire has a smaller percentage of Hispanics -- who overwhelmingly disapprove of Mr. Trump -- than Ohio's 3.5%.
Restricting foreign trade, one of Mr. Trump's signature issues, is a particularly potent issue in the manufacturing-heavy state and has emerged as a centerpiece of Democrat Ted Strickland's campaign to oust GOP Sen. Rob Portman.
And this year's March primary, which Mr. Trump lost to Mr. Kasich, added 363,000 more Republican voters to the state's voter rolls than Democrats, according to Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted.
Mr. Trump's troubles recruiting Ohio staff come as the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows broad sections of Republicans are coalescing behind the New York developer, helping him narrow the gap with Mrs. Clinton to 3 percentage points.
In the past week, Mr. Trump's political director Rick Wiley began his search for top Ohio staff, which he hopes to have in place by June.
One of Mr. Wiley's first Ohio calls went to Jeff Polesovsky, the political director for Mr. Kasich's presidential campaign and a senior aide during his two runs for governor. Mr. Polesovsky told Mr. Wiley that he isn't ready to join the Trump campaign, according to people familiar with the conversation. Mr. Kasich has declined to endorse Mr. Trump.
The governor hasn't put out a formal notice to his aides to avoid working for Mr. Trump, but several of them interviewed said they wouldn't take a job with him without first discussing it with Mr. Kasich.
""There's no one in a senior- or midlevel position in the campaign in Ohio or in any of the states where we had staff who would or will be going to work for Donald Trump,"" said John Weaver, Mr. Kasich's senior strategist during his presidential campaign. ""The very things that attracted them to John are the things that would keep them from working for Trump. Plus, they would be shot.""
Meanwhile, Clinton aides are preparing to open the first campaign office in Columbus and have begun coordinating with the Ohio Democratic Party to recruit an army of volunteers who backed both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders in the state's primary.
At the same time, Priorities USA, the super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, last week began airing the first $6 million of TV advertising attacking Mr. Trump in Ohio, Virginia, Nevada and Florida. The super PACs backing Mr. Trump are still trying to raise money while his campaign is only now building a national fundraising apparatus.
Mr. Wiley said the Trump campaign has ""made tremendous strides"" building its general election team since becoming the presumptive nominee.
Yet senior Trump aides have had no communication with the Ohio Republican Party and very little with aides to Mr. Portman, who has built his own statewide get-out-the-vote apparatus as he prepares for a difficult re-election bid. The Ohio GOP chairman, Matt Borges, who emerged during the primary campaign as one of the nation's most strident anti-Trump voices, said he hasn't done anything to help Mr. Trump because he hasn't heard what the campaign would like him to do.
Mrs. Clinton's team here is led by Chris Wyant, a veteran of Mr. Obama's two Ohio campaigns. Last week, Mr. Wyant and another Clinton aide watched as 30 local Democratic Party activists made calls to recruit volunteers.
About half of the activists interviewed said they backed Mr. Sanders during Ohio's primary, but each believed they must work to elect Mrs. Clinton.
""The difference between any Democrat and Trump is so spectacular that I had to come help,"" said Tony Collins-Sibley, a 54-year-old cabinet maker who wore a ""Bernie 2016"" T-shirt.

Trump Narrows Gap With Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790309388?accountid=12768,"Republicans have rallied behind Donald Trump in the weeks since he effectively clinched his party's presidential nomination, helping him narrow Democrat Hillary Clinton's once double-digit lead to just 3 percentage points, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows.
Mrs. Clinton leads the New York businessman, 46% to 43%, in a test matchup between the two likely nominees, the poll finds. That represents a much tighter margin than her 11-percentage-point lead in April and marks the first time in Journal/NBC News polling this year that her support has dropped below 50% in a contest with Mr. Trump.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who faces long odds of wresting the Democratic nomination from Mrs. Clinton, leads Mr. Trump by a much wider, 15-point margin, 54% to 39%, in a hypothetical matchup.
The main reason Mr. Trump has eaten into Mrs. Clinton's lead is he enjoys much wider support from GOP voters after his decisive win in the Indiana primary earlier this month, a victory that prompted his two remaining rivals to exit the race. The presumptive GOP nominee has also opened a modest lead among self-described independent voters.
In the matchup against Mrs. Clinton, Republican support for Mr. Trump jumped to 86% from 72% in mid-April, while the share of GOP voters who said they would support Mrs. Clinton fell to 6% from 13% a month earlier. Democrats' support for Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, remains largely unchanged.
The poll shows the race at this early point is virtually a statistical dead heat. That is in keeping with other polling done since Mr. Trump vanquished his remaining Republican primary foes.
To some extent the polling reflects for Mr. Trump the boost that naturally comes when a candidate prevails in a primary race and stops coming under direct attack by his primary rivals, a luxury Mrs. Clinton doesn't have and may not until her party's July convention. Still, the results, though early, are troubling for the Democratic team because they may suggest how much damage the bruising primary fight has done to her, which could linger after the battle ends.
""Republican voters are consolidating behind Trump. And a more united Republican Party, combined with an electorate looking for major change, has made this a too-close-to-call campaign,"" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducts the Journal/NBC News survey with Democrat Fred Yang.
The two likely nominees still suffer from the worst public images in the modern history of presidential politics, with 58% viewing Mr. Trump negatively and 54% expressing similar sentiments about Mrs. Clinton. But that tally marks an improvement for Mr. Trump since April, when some 65% of voters expressed an unfavorable opinion about him.
""Either one is a terrible choice,"" said Steve Swanstrom, 78, a Republican in Fort Myers, Fla., who favored Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the primary and isn't sure what he will do in November.
A more favorable view of Mr. Trump among Republicans is primarily responsible for his improved image. In April, GOP voters split 42% to 42% between those who viewed him favorably and those who saw him in a negative light. This month, after Mr. Trump essentially sealed the nomination, the split was 58% positive to 25% negative.
Mr. Trump also enjoys a slightly better -- if still overwhelmingly negative -- image among independent voters, with 58% viewing him negatively and 26% viewing him positively. Independents now see him slightly more positively than they do Mrs. Clinton, helping the Republican open a 5-percentage-point lead over the likely Democratic nominee among these voters.
""Again, Donald Trump defies the conventional wisdom by consolidating the GOP support early, but a much steeper hill lies ahead with independents and persuadable voters,"" said Peter Hart, a Democrat who is part of the Journal/NBC News polling team.
Perhaps the best news in the survey for Mr. Trump is that he outpaces Mrs. Clinton, 46% to 43%, in the 12 most competitive presidential battleground states -- states that President Barack Obama won by 1.5 percentage points in 2012. He does particularly well in the South and Midwest.
But national polls such as this don't fully capture the two candidates' standing in these 12 states because they aggregate the numbers, which can vary dramatically from one state to the next.
The share of Democratic primary voters who view Mrs. Clinton favorably dropped from 84% last June to 65% in the latest poll, while the share who view her negatively jumped from 7% to 21%.
A chief task for any nominee is to unify his or her party ahead of the general election. In the new survey, some 83% of Democrats said they prefer Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump, down slightly from 87% in April.
A remarkable 1-in-10 voters say they wouldn't vote for either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump, and 47% say they would consider an independent or third-party candidate in the fall, up from 40% in the spring of 2012.
Mr. Yang, the Democratic pollster, said that ""despite a rough couple weeks and the prospect of a tough campaign ahead, the fundamentals look favorable for Hillary Clinton. Her advantage in the trial heat against Trump for the most part mirrors the Obama '12 numbers among key constituencies; in fact, Trump is doing slightly less well among white voters overall than Romney did four years ago.""
The survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted May 15-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Declarations: Clinton-Sanders: Maybe That's the Ticket,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790317520?accountid=12768,"Let's begin with a prophecy: It is not only the Republican Party that is breaking and perhaps re-forming. The Democratic Party is also starting to come apart. We're seeing the first signs of it now.
A significant part of the base is going left. Bernie Sanders took off because they want a socialist. The party is going left for a host of reasons: the crash of 2008, economic strain, eight years of President Obama, trends within American culture and education. Hillary Clinton's struggles this year are connected in part to her ideological unreliability, to the sense that she's a generation behind ideologically, that she's got the wrong attitude toward Wall Street and the use of military power. She's old school; we're entering something new.
Here's what I suspect is coming whatever happens this year. Just as a portion of Republicans -- nobody knows how big -- will break from the GOP over Donald Trump, some percentage of Democrats, especially among the affluent, will, in the next cycle, start to peel off from their party over its lurch leftward. They will not be at home in a party of smiley-face socialism that threatens to become actual socialism. They will not want the American economy destroyed. They will not be comfortable in a party that supports the most extreme political correctness; they do not want their 10-year-old daughters using transgendered bathrooms with men. They will find themselves increasingly opposed to the political correctness that has swept the universities. They will have increasing qualms about spending $60,000 a year to have their bright, kind children turned into leftist robots.
So they will start to split off from the Democrats, and they will find the Republicans who split off in 2016, and together, in 2020 or so, they will attempt to create their own party. It will be pro-growth, moderate on social issues, more or less neoconservative in its foreign policy. It will be smallish but well-heeled. It will try to hold together and grow.
That is my prophecy. Everything is in play.
I mentioned the strains, shifts and breakage within the Democratic Party that you can see right now. Nothing illustrated it like what happened last Saturday in Las Vegas, when a state Democratic Party convention turned violent, with chairs thrown, fists shaken, curses screamed. Sen. Barbara Boxer, longtime California liberal and Clinton supporter, was heckled and booed. She later said she'd feared for her safety. The state Democratic chairwoman reported threats of bodily harm, including a text message that said: ""We know where you live . . . Where your kids go to school/grandkids. We have everything on you.""
It doesn't get much uglier than that. At issue, procedures surrounding the delegate-selection process and Sanders supporters' claim that the deck was stacked against them. This was the local expression of a larger national argument over whether the Democratic National Committee and its chairman, Hillary friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz, were, as Donald Trump used to say, rigging the system.
After the Vegas melee Mr. Sanders was relatively unrepentant. He blandly said a few days later that he opposes all forms of violence. He told a California rally that the Democratic Party ""can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real social and economic change.""
The Democratic divide can be seen in other ways. Dante Chinni of this newspaper took a dive into the demographics of Kentucky, whose primary this week ""shows how deep divisions are within the Democratic Party."" A racially diverse segment, ""located in cities and their surrounding suburbs, is largely behind Mrs. Clinton, while a less-diverse and largely rural part of the party backs Sen. Sanders."" Mrs. Clinton won narrowly, carrying the most populous counties and most of those with the largest African-American populations, Mr. Sanders the least populous and all the least diverse counties. His voters in Kentucky were rural and white, which was true also in Michigan and New York. ""The tensions within the party aren't likely to lessen,"" Mr. Chinni concluded.
California votes June 7. A journalist this week speculated in conversation that if Mrs. Clinton underperforms or even loses there, it could be a gift. It will make her desperate. Presuming she goes on to win the nomination, her desperation might prompt her to make Bernie Sanders her vice presidential nominee.
Why not? It would hold the party together for this cycle. It would help keep Sanders voters, who often threaten to go elsewhere if Mrs. Clinton is the nominee, in the tent. It would also unsettle Trumpworld. They see Bernie supporters as potential Trump supporters in the general election, and Mr. Sanders as having an appeal that overlaps with their own. They see his outsider mystique and his appeal to the young.
Would Mrs. Clinton do it? If it were the only choice, she would. Would he? He hasn't ruled it out. In early May, Mr. Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he was ""focused"" on winning the nomination, and, if he does not succeed, ""we are going to fight as hard as we can"" to make the Democratic platform more ""progressive."" ""Then, after that,"" he said, ""certainly Secretary Clinton and I can sit down and talk and see where we go from there.""
Maybe he'd hold Mrs. Clinton hostage on the platform before he would agree to be her vice president. Maybe she'd accept a more left-wing platform to get the vice president she thinks she needs.
A Clinton-Sanders ticket would be the oldest presidential ticket in U.S. history, totaling a combined 142 years. You can characterize that as ancient and out of it, or you can see it as mature, experienced. Up against Mr. Trump, the latter might not look so bad.
Mr. Trump too is looking for a vice president. I don't understand those who say he should get an attack dog, since he is an attack dog. He doesn't need a dramatic Northeastern governor with a reputation as a bully, he already has a reputation as a bully. Nor do I understand why they say Mr. Trump needs someone exciting. He's quite exciting enough. He doesn't require someone who can help him with the ins and outs of Capitol Hill. That would be nice and come in handy, but it's also the kind of talent he can hire as staff.
What he needs is Stable Man or Stable Woman. He needs someone with real and obvious political accomplishment -- a longtime senator or, less attractively, a representative, or a governor, preferably a current one. John Kasich says he isn't interested, but maybe he will get interested. Newt Gingrich is on the list, which is understandable in many respects, but he has the same slightly mad quotient as Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump needs ""He's not crazy.""
Big ships need ballast to keep the ship upright, to keep it from tipping over when a high wave comes. Ballast is by its nature uninteresting. Mr. Trump needs ballast. He would benefit from a solid, uninteresting running mate.
Uninteresting would come as such a relief this year. It would be like the old days, when people were boring.

"Melania, Bill and Kids Belonged Off-Stage; When Clinton and Trump call on family to make them seem human, it backfires--at least on me.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807806951?accountid=12768,"My best guess is that watching the Republican and Democratic Party conventions changed no one's mind. At the conclusion of the performances people who were dubious about either candidate remained dubious, and people who had signed on in support of one or the other candidate were reinforced in their decision. A lot of huff, a lot of puff, but no doors were blown down.
What I found new, and more than a touch appalling, was the dragging in of family members in support of each candidate. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were introduced for their final speeches by daughters. Mr. Trump's wife and Mrs. Clinton's husband each spoke on behalf of his or her spouse. The idea behind this rallying of family, of course, was to make the candidate seem warmer, more intimate, more human--not, given who they really are, an easy assignment.
Nor, if I may say so, one successfully carried out during either convention. When Bill Clinton spoke of his courtship of Hillary, of what a remarkably bright young woman and splendid wife and mother she was, I was waiting for him to end by adding: ""And she gave me plenty of latitude to philander pretty much to my heart's content."" When Chelsea Clinton talked about her lovely full-court-press mother leaving her notes, all I could think of was a note that read: ""Your dumb father has apparently exposed himself in front of a woman named Paula Jones. I don't know what we're going to do about that s.o.b.""
When Donald Trump's sons spoke about what a splendid role-model their father was, I wondered which son was of which of Trump's three trophy marriages. When his daughter introduced him on the final night, I wondered if her mother was at home laughing, an ample alimony check on the coffee table before her. When his current wife spoke about his many virtues and the promise of America, I wondered about the size of her eventual divorce settlement.
In brief, the attempt to make these two rather inhuman political candidates seem human entirely backfired, at least on me. I like to think that my countrymen and countrywomen are not so naive that they bought a word of any of this balderdash. Yet the television cameras--I watched as much as I could bear of either convention on PBS--played on faces of the true believers in the audience. When Mr. Trump's children spoke, admiration beamed from the crowd; in the case of Chelsea Clinton's talk, much tearing up was in evidence. When the camera returned to the panel of pundits high above the convention halls, I expected at least one among to exclaim, ""A joke, right?"" But of course, going along with the game, none did.
What point can there possibly be in attempting to humanize politicians? Deciding to run for office, at least under current arrangements, means retiring from some of the principal requirements of most human beings: a need for privacy, a desire to be honest, regard for one's personal integrity. Contemporary politics, let us agree, does not allow much leeway for any of these. It requires instead the ability to be at ease during personal exhibitionism, to evade the most obvious truths and spin every story to benefit one's own career, to profess continuously one's own extraordinary virtue.
I prefer politicians who do not relentlessly insist that they are caring, sharing persons. I much prefer politicians whose only claim is that they have a vision for the country and believe they have some talent at helping to bring this vision to life in legislation. I prefer candidates who, always indirectly, make plain that they love this game--the game of politics--and believe they are good at it. Whether they are also great wives, devoted husbands, the most sensitive mothers and fathers does not really interest me. If I want good mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, I'll start attending PTA meetings.

Glass-Steagall-Trump-Clinton Act; The GOP joins Sanders and Warren in pointless re-regulation.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807429941?accountid=12768,"The Republican and Democratic Party platforms don't agree on much, so what does it mean that this year they both call for reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933? It means that as both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton pursue Bernie Sanders voters, they can be equally irrelevant to our current financial era.
On Monday night Mr. Sanders celebrated an endorsement in the Democratic Party platform for reinstating Glass-Steagall, which had been one of his campaign themes. This followed last week's last-minute addition of a similar plank into the Republican platform. The GOP move was hailed by Mr. Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort, who probably maneuvered it to appeal to the Sanders voters who Mr. Trump is courting.
Glass-Steagall separated commercial banking--i.e., taking deposits and making loans--from investment banking businesses like trading stocks and bonds. Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have flogged the belief that when Bill Clinton repealed what was left of Glass-Steagall in 1999, he opened the door for banks to gamble on Wall Street and thus caused the 2008 financial panic.
Too bad there's no evidence that this had anything to do with the crisis. The panic started in investment firms like Bear Stearns that were not commercial banks. Ditto for Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. They failed because they ran into liquidity crises due to over-leverage and a portfolio of bad mortgage securities. AIG also wasn't a bank.
The commercial banks that contributed most to the panic--including Wachovia and Washington Mutual--made too many bad mortgage loans. Bank of America got into trouble buying Countrywide Financial, which had issued too many bad mortgages. Citigroup made a mess with off-balance sheet assets that also included too much real estate.
The real source of the crisis was the Federal Reserve's monetary policy that subsidized excess credit and federal affordable-housing goals that with the help of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encouraged subprime and ""liar"" mortgage loans. Plenty of small banks with little exposure to the capital markets but too much to real estate also failed. Glass-Steagall was irrelevant.
With taxpayer backing and thin capital levels, bankers and financiers can find all kinds of trouble, whether on Wall Street or any other street, and regardless of the size of their firms. Having a regulator decide which risks to avoid creates its own risks, as when capital rules and credit-ratings requirements herded much of the financial world into supposedly safe mortgage-backed securities before the panic.
The Volcker Rule that is part of Dodd-Frank is supposed to prevent commercial banks from risky securities trading, though it is so complicated it's hard to tell. Banks today are highly integrated and breaking them up would be difficult and highly disruptive. The better solution is to shrink the taxpayer safety net, raising capital standards high enough so that banks that take insured deposits can better withstand trading or lending mistakes. Outside the safety net, let companies take greater risks but also let them fail.
This is the solution that House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling is promoting, and it doesn't include reinstating Glass-Steagall. If a new President insists on reinstating it anyway, then we trust Mr. Hensarling will exact a heavy negotiating price such as privatizing Fannie and Freddie, among other reforms.

Election 2016: Clinton Defends Her Email Practices,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791555739?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton, speaking a day after a critical report from a government watchdog about her email practices as secretary of state, said her use of a private email server for official business was permitted at the time, but was a mistake in judgment.
""It was allowed,"" she said in a Thursday television interview in Las Vegas, according to a transcript provided by ABC News. ""And the rules have been clarified since I left about the practice. Having said that, I have said many times it was a mistake and if I could go back, I would do it differently.""
State Department Inspector General Steve Linick, in a report sent to Congress Wednesday and released publicly Thursday, sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server as a breach of record-keeping rules, internal State Department information technology policies and cybersecurity practices.
""Department employees must use agency-authorized information systems to conduct normal day-to-day operations because the use of nondepartmental systems creates significant security risks,"" the report concluded.
The inspector general noted that Colin Powell also exclusively used private email for government business when he was secretary of state, but added the rules had grown ""considerably more detailed and more sophisticated"" by the time Mrs. Clinton came into office.
The report said that while occasional use of personal email was widespread in the government, Mrs. Clinton's exclusive reliance on a home-based server for all her official business was rare. The inspector general identified Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Powell and a U.S. Ambassador to Kenya as officials who exclusively used private email. The ambassador later resigned after the department attempted to initiate disciplinary proceedings over his email usage.
State Department officials proposed setting up a separate computer system to allow Mrs. Clinton to check non-State Department email at her office, according to testimony released Thursday from Lewis Lukens, a State Department official who worked on logistical issues for Mrs. Clinton. But the plan was never implemented.
The State Department plans to make clear that employees could face penalties for use of a private email account for day-to-day operations, according to the report.
Mrs. Clinton conducted the interview with ABC on condition that the network distribute it to other news outlets. She told ABC that ""the report is consistent with what I have been saying, that the use of personal email was a practice by other secretaries of state, and the rules were not clarified until after I had left.""

Trump Rakes the Clinton Muck,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791555681?accountid=12768,"If the political class had a theme song, it would be that old Toby Keith tune, ""I Wanna Talk About Me."" Donald Trump knows the feeling, though of late he has been focusing on others. He wants to talk about Bill. He wants to talk about Hillary. He wants to talk about the 1990s, and Vince Foster, and Juanita Broaddrick.
He wants to talk about things that could help him win an election.
That Hillary Clinton today has a shot at the White House comes down to one reality: People forget. This is a politician utterly defined by scandal, and with more baggage than the carousels at Dulles International. She ought to be disqualified. And yet the Clintons thrive, the beneficiaries of forgetfulness. They've spent decades bulling through their messes, blaming their woes on right-wing plots, and depending on a fickle press and a busy nation to lose interest in their wretchedness. It works every time.
Yet Mr. Trump has a way of disrupting the status quo. He does this in part by behaving in ways most politicians wouldn't or couldn't. Unlike Republicans who may be wary of resurrecting the Clinton past, for instance, Mr. Trump is not afraid of being labeled ""obsessive."" But there is usually a method to his madness. And his current let's-campaign-like-it's-1999 strategy has purpose -- it's part offense, part defense.
On offensive, Mr. Trump's goal is to play off the soaring distrust Americans have in Mrs. Clinton by tying the past to the present. He wants voters to realize that the Whitewater land deal and Paula Jones aren't dusty, closed chapters in the Clintons' history. They are, rather, markers on a long continuum, one that begins with young Bill's draft-dodging and continues today with mature Hillary's private-email-server deletions and Clinton Foundation money-grubbing. And those scandals would accompany the Clintons back to the White House and define the next eight years, a prospect that Mr. Trump hopes will depress the entire nation.
""[W]hether it's Whitewater or whether it's Vince or whether it's Benghazi. It's always a mess with Hillary,"" said Mr. Trump in a recent interview.
The Clintons will claim that nobody cares. It's also possible that younger Americans -- some of whom were in diapers during the Clinton administration -- can't figure out why people are suddenly talking about blue dresses. Still, give Mr. Trump marks for doing more than any politician in recent memory to educate. The newspapers are suddenly brimming with synopses of Filegate, Chinagate, Travelgate, cattle futures, the Marc Rich pardon, Kathleen Willey and White House looting.
Which is also part of the Trump offense: Energizing GOP base voters. Older Republicans in particular remain frustrated that the Clintons have never been held to account, and that the media so easily lost interest in the scandals. So to hear a Republican nominee take it to the Clintons -- and on the sort of bare-knuckle terms that only they understand -- is exciting.
Mr. Trump's hits about the 1990s are also defensive moves, against what might otherwise be Mrs. Clinton's biggest strength -- the ""women's issue."" Democrats have used the ""war on women"" theme against Republicans for more than a decade, and for the most part successfully. Mrs. Clinton is already playing the women's card, accusing Mr. Trump of insulting women. His response goes like this: ""You want to talk about women? Awesome. Let's talk about Bill.""
His ad on Instagram, featuring Bill Clinton chomping on a cigar, with the voices of women describing his unwanted sexual advances in the background, along with an ominous Hillary cackle, was a study in full-throttle bluntness.
You can debate whether Mr. Trump, given his colorful past, has much of a leg to stand on here. But the point is that the Clintons are, if anything, worse. What's Hillary going to do? Defend Bill? That might not go over well with women, including survivors of sexual assault, who, Mrs. Clinton said last year, ""have the right to be heard . . . the right to be believed."" So far Mrs. Clinton has been forced to sit silent, gritting her teeth as the media run fresh interviews with Mrs. Broaddrick, who says that Mr. Clinton raped her in 1978 when he was the Arkansas attorney general.
Mrs. Clinton now knows that attacking Mr. Trump about women will invite a counterattack from him citing Paula Jones, another of Bill's accusers. So perhaps Mrs. Clinton will lay off that front. Which is Mr. Trump's goal. He's playing for a draw on this issue.
Does Mr. Trump's Bad Bill approach risk making Mrs. Clinton look like a victim? It might, if this were the 1990s, and she were still viewed as the victim of a philandering husband. But Hillary has spent the past 16 years embracing her womanizer, using his fame and fortune to bolster her presidential run. And this is the woman who, according to her longtime friend Diane Blair, railed that Monica Lewinsky was a ""narcissistic loony-tune."" It's hard to feel sorry for a woman willing to blame her husband's dishonor on a 22-year-old intern.
What matters most about this Trump strategy is that it's a marker of what's to come. The Clintons play hardball. Mr. Trump intends to play smashball. For them, that's new.

Robots for Trump (and Clinton),http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791555645?accountid=12768,"No matter what happens in November, one big winner has already emerged from the ruins of America's 2016 election: the robot. Both major candidates have embraced policies that will ensure the accelerating replacement of low-wage workers with no-wage workers.
Under President Donald Trump, illegal immigrants and possibly even legal migrants will have a harder time finding work, meaning the businesses that now rely on their labor will turn to machines. Under President Hillary Clinton, a big increase in the minimum wage is certainly in the cards, in which case get used to ordering your Big Mac on a touch screen.
At the same time, robotics is advancing technologically by leaps and bounds. Driverless cars are looking more and more like the future of the taxi industry, thus cutting off one of the typical routes to employment for immigrants. Truck-driving, meatpacking, fast-food preparation and hotel cleaning are ripe for automation as well.
The robotics industry has so far concentrated on relatively high-end work -- vehicle-assembly systems or medicine. But the combination of the minimum-wage hikes in cities and states dominated by Democrats and new pressures on immigrant workers will create a set of incentives for the world's robot-builders. They will begin to concentrate their efforts on building new categories of affordable and reliable machines to replace what used to be called entry-level jobs.
Medical robots have rapidly improved over the last decade, and systems that assist surgeons in complex operations such as spinal fusion are now common. In the near future autonomous robots will be able to perform simple procedures such as biopsies at a fraction of the cost of a fully manned operating room. From there the possibilities are endless: The technology needed to replace a hotel maid or a fast-food chef should be relatively simple.
Since 9/11, the U.S. military has poured billions of dollars into robotics research. The benefits from that investment are beginning to reach the civilian world. Robots that can walk on four or two legs have been built and tested, and although they have not yet been approved for use on the battlefield, no one in the military doubts that soon such systems will be widespread.
The societal effects of this robotics revolution are likely to be less benign than the results of the information revolution, but just as unstoppable. Young people will find it even harder to find entry-level jobs. Will unemployable youth turn to drugs and crime, or will they simply waste away in their parents' basements playing videogames?
One already troubled government program, Social Security, could be devastated by the robotics revolution. If ever-fewer human workers are paying into the system while larger and larger numbers of seniors are getting benefits, bankruptcy seems inevitable. Unless we can tax the robots?

Election 2016: Clinton Seeks Momentum in California Race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791224653?accountid=12768,"RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Hillary Clinton is seeking to close out a surprisingly contentious presidential primary with a victory here that would send her into the general election with momentum and mute Democratic rival Bernie Sanders's argument that she's a weak front-runner.
""I need your help in this upcoming primary because we want to finish strong,"" Mrs. Clinton told supporters Tuesday at a rally here. ""We want to send that message that we are going to fight every day.""
Both candidates are working hard for the 475 delegates at stake in the June 7 primary in California. There are also contests in five other states, and barring a total collapse, Mrs. Clinton is likely to capture enough delegates that night to claim the presidential nomination, possibly before the polls close in the Golden State.
Confident in her position, Mrs. Clinton declined to participate in a final debate and she ignored questions about a State Department report released Wednesday that found her private email system violated agency policies.
But her campaign said Wednesday it would start airing TV ads in three markets, a ""six-figure"" buy and a proposition her campaign had hoped to avoid. It also appears to be running an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation. It has nine field offices, and an aide said phone banks in seven languages and door-to-door visits have been under way for two weeks.
Mrs. Clinton has also pressed her advantage with party leaders. Elected officials at every level, union leaders, women's rights activists and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have headlined events.On Wednesday, she was introduced by actress Jamie Lee Curtis.
The state should set up well for Mrs. Clinton. She easily won the 2008 primary. That year, nearly half the electorate was nonwhite, and she has done well with minority voters this year.
At rallies, Mrs. Clinton doesn't even mention Mr. Sanders, focusing instead on the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump.
But even as Mrs. Clinton looks to the fall, many of her backers remain uneasy with Mr. Sanders's continued presence in the race.
""He should just stop,"" said Conni Lira, 70 years old, of Pico Rivera, who saw Mrs. Clinton at a union organizing eventTuesday. ""He's just making it more difficult for her when he doesn't have a chance.""
Mr. Sanders isn't going away. He has 17 rallies planned or completed over an 11-day stretch. He projects he will have spoken to 200,000 people by June 7. He has four field offices and 80 paid workers.
Mr. Sanders has already spent about a half-million dollars on satellite-TV ads, which can be carefully targeted, according to tracking by Kantar Media CMAG. The campaign says it has bought $1.5 million on its new buy.
Mr. Sanders released a new TV ad this week that urges voters to think beyond the nomination contest itself to what has become a broader effort to transform the Democratic Party. The unspoken message is that a Sanders vote isn't wasted, even if he can't win.
""What choice do Californians have in this election?"" Mr. Sanders asks in the ad. ""The biggest one of all: You have the power to choose a new direction for the Democratic Party.""
As Mr. Sanders campaigned in recent days in liberal strongholds of California, he drew crowds of thousands; his supporters treat him like a rock star, chanting his name.
Mr. Sanders has built a grass-roots operation aimed at tapping into the enthusiasm that runs strong for him and his cause. That includes a Bay Area campaign headquarters in Oakland, a storefront where three dozen people were working on phone banks one recent weekday morning.
They were focusing heavily on voter registration, working up against a deadline just four days away for voters to change their party registration and become eligible to participate in the Democratic primary.
Iris Safar, of Modesto, was among the volunteers. A 36-year old yoga instructor, Ms. Safar said the only time she has voted in a presidential race was in 2000 when she voted for Ralph Nader's third-party bid.
""I'd never marched, never protested, never been involved in anything political,"" Ms. Safar said. ""When I go to a Bernie event, I'm with a group of people that have a higher level of consciousness. You are with kindred spirits.""

Clinton Violated Policies On Email,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791222963?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and her lax record-keeping while secretary of state violated the department's policies, an independent watchdog said Wednesday, a rebuke that keeps the issue alive as she campaigns for president.
Inspector General Steve Linick contradicted Mrs. Clinton's argument that her exclusive use of a private email server while running the State Department was permitted, but offered her some cover by faulting previous secretaries of state for similar breaches. It also criticizes broader lapses at the State Department, especially regarding failures to keep adequate records of electronic communications including email dating back nearly 20 years.
He said Mrs. Clinton had an obligation to discuss her email setup with the officials responsible for security and information management at the State Department, but found no evidence that she had done so.
The report also found evidence that several hacking attempts were made against her home server, though the inspector general didn't determine whether they were successful.
The findings are a reminder that the issue isn't likely to fade as the presidential campaign moves toward the November election. More significant hurdles are ahead, particularly the decision by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department about whether to pursue any legal action in connection with the emails.
The report -- sent to several congressional committees with oversight over the State Department -- makes no recommendation that Mrs. Clinton or any other former secretary of State be investigated or punished. Mrs. Clinton has maintained that her server didn't put sensitive information at risk, and her campaign stressed Wednesday that the review showed her four immediate predecessors followed similar practices.
In part because of the email controversy, Mrs. Clinton has struggled with voters on issues of honesty and trust. In an April Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, 60% of voters gave the Democratic candidate poor marks on being honest and straightforward, while only 19% give her high ratings on those traits. She is also likely to face an onslaught of attacks from presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has taken to calling her ""crooked Hillary.""
Mrs. Clinton has long denied any wrongdoing. ""Hillary Clinton's use of personal email was not unique, and she took steps that went much further than others to appropriately preserve and release her records,"" Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said.
Mr. Trump described the inspector-general report as ""not good"" for Mrs. Clinton.
In April, most of Mrs. Clinton's senior aides from her time at the State Department were interviewed by the FBI, and agents are expected to interview Mrs. Clinton in coming weeks. There has been no indication a grand jury has heard evidence from anyone in the matter -- a necessary step before the consideration of an indictment.
Both Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey have said they won't be rushed by the political calendar or outside pressure to resolve the case.
Separately, Mrs. Clinton's top aides are being interviewed under oath as part of two civil lawsuits brought against the State Department by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which is seeking records from Mrs. Clinton's time in office.
Congressional panels also are expected to conduct further scrutiny of the Clinton emails in the coming months, House aides said.
Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican and chairman of the committee that first revealed Mrs. Clinton's private email account, said the inspector general's findings vindicated his panel's work. ""Any truly comprehensive review of what happened before, during, and after the 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya must include public records from the former secretary of state and her senior staff,"" he said.
The report contradicted Mrs. Clinton's argument that her exclusive use of a private email server was permitted, but offered her some cover by faulting several previous secretaries of state for using personal email. It also criticizes broader lapses at the State Department, especially regarding failures to keep adequate records of electronic communications including email dating back nearly 20 years.
The report said former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who served under Republican President George W. Bush, exclusively used a personal email account while at the department. The report notes Mr. Powell and staff to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, may not have archived emails and other materials properly.
""These problems have transcended administrations -- both Democratic and Republican,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.).
Still, inspector general Linick, appointed by President Barack Obama, singled out Mrs. Clinton for the security risks involved in using a private email account as well as her failure to immediately turn over thousands of pages of work emails upon leaving government in 2013.
The inspector general noted internal rules about email and cybersecurity had grown ""considerably more detailed and more sophisticated"" by the time Mrs. Clinton came into office. ""Secretary Clinton's cybersecurity practices accordingly must be evaluated in light of these more comprehensive directives,"" the report said.
In one instance, the inspector general found that in 2011, a technical staffer wrote that ""someone was trying to hack us and while they did not get in i (didn't) want to let them have the chance to."" The same staffer wrote later that day: ""We were attacked again so I shut [the server] down."" In another instance in 2011, two of Mrs. Clinton's staff wrote that they were concerned someone was ""hacking into her email.""
As a result of the inspector general's findings, the State Department will make clear that employees could face penalties for use of a private email account for day-to-day operations at the department, according to the inspector general's report.
""Department employees must use agency-authorized information systems to conduct normal day-to-day operations,"" the report concluded.
Mrs. Clinton has said she used a single private email for ""convenience"". Emails reviewed by the inspector general also show that her concerns about privacy played a role.
When a top staffer suggested that she either share her email address with staff or get a government account, Mrs. Clinton wrote: ""Let's get separate address or device but I don't want any risk of the personal being accessible.""
That email wasn't included as part of the 55,000 pages turned over by Mrs. Clinton's attorneys -- raising questions about her disclosures. In addition, emails from Mrs. Clinton's early months in office weren't preserved. Mrs. Clinton has also come under fire for erasing roughly 30,000 emails that her attorneys deemed purely personal.

Clinton's Email Deceptions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791222051?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton has said for more than a year that her use of a private email server as Secretary of State violated no federal rules and posed no security risk. Only the gullible believed that, and now everyone has proof of her deceptions in a scathing report from State Department Inspector General Steve Linick.
The report obtained by news outlets Wednesday is ostensibly an audit of the email practices of five secretaries of State. But the majority of the report, and the most withering criticism, focuses on Mrs. Clinton. The IG concludes that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee broke federal record-keeping rules, never received permission for her off-grid server, ignored security concerns raised by other officials, and employed a staff that flouted the rules with the same disdain she did.
""Secretary Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary,"" says the report. ""At a minimum, Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and, because she did not do so, she did not comply with the Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.""
State still has never received emails from her private account for the first six weeks after she became Secretary, and the IG notes that it found (by other means) business-related emails that Mrs. Clinton did not include among the emails she has turned over.
The report says she has also stonewalled requests to obtain her server. And ""through her Counsel, Secretary Clinton declined [the IG's] request for an interview."" Former Secretaries Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and current Secretary John Kerry all sat for interviews.
Mrs. Clinton's staff abetted her bad practices. The report says the IG ""learned of extensive use of personal email accounts by four immediate staff members (none of whom responded to the questionnaire). . . . The material consists of nearly 72,000 pages in hard copy and more than 7.5 gigabytes of electronic data. One of the staff submitted 9,585 emails spanning January 22, 2009 to February 24, 2013, average 9 emails per workday sent on a personal email account.""
The IG -- who had better hire a food-taster -- also found that Mrs. Clinton neither sought nor received permission for her private communications. The former Secretary also understood the security risks this posed because she was warned several times.
In March 2011 the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security sent Mrs. Clinton an email that warned of a ""dramatic increase"" in attempts by ""cyber actors to compromise the private home e-mail accounts of senior Department officials,"" with an eye toward ""technical surveillance and possible blackmail.""
Following that memo, security staff twice briefed Mrs. Clinton's immediate staff on this threat. A June 2011 cable, sent over Mrs. Clinton's name to all diplomatic and consular posts, warned of this new threat to home accounts, as well as the news that Google had reported cyber attacks on the Gmail accounts of U.S. government employees. Mrs. Clinton and her staff ignored her own warnings.
One official suggested State set up a stand-alone computer for Mrs. Clinton in her office to check the Internet and private email. That never happened. A different official suggested she have two mobile devices -- one for personal use and one with a ""State Department email account"" that would ""be subject to [Freedom of Information Act] requests."" Her team said no.
As for Mrs. Clinton's claim that her private account was secure, the report cites several instances of techies shutting down her server due to hacking concerns. ""Notification is required when a user suspects compromise of, among other things, a personally owned device containing personally identifiable information,"" says the report. But the IG says it found ""no evidence"" that Mrs. Clinton or her staff filed such reports.
---
The Clinton campaign is resorting to its familiar strategy of calling this old news while saying everybody does it because Mr. Powell also failed to keep records of private email while he was in office. ""GOP will attack HRC because she is running for President, but IG report makes clear her personal email use was not unique at State Dept,"" tweeted Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon. But Mr. Powell's use of private email was limited, and he never set up an unsecure server in his home.
All of this should bear on the FBI's email probe and whether Mrs. Clinton understood the security risks she was running. On the IG's extensive evidence, she clearly did -- and then she lied about it. Voters should understand that this is precisely the kind of governance Mrs. Clinton would return to the White House.",2016-08-03
Election 2016 -- The Wall Street Journal / NBC News Poll: Clinton or Trump? Voters Say No,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790561271?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump share a defining asset that is fueling support for both in the 2016 presidential race: voters' animus toward the other candidate.
More than half of registered voters in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll who said they plan to cast ballots for Mrs. Clinton this fall say their decision is more about opposing Mr. Trump than supporting the likely Democratic nominee. A slightly larger share of Trump backers says the same about their vote for the Republican candidate.
That finding underscores just how discouraged many voters are about the likely choices in a general-election showdown that would pit the two least-popular presidential candidates in modern history in a race already defined by frustration and anger over the status quo.
The WSJ/NBC News poll found Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump, 46% to 43%, among registered voters, down from her 11 percentage-point lead a month earlier. The race has grown tighter in large measure because Republicans are rallying around Mr. Trump.
Clear dividing lines have emerged between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on what comes down to energy versus experience, the poll suggests.
Mr. Trump starts with a lead over Mrs. Clinton on the question of who would do a better job in handling the economy, protecting the U.S. on trade and dealing with Wall Street. His biggest advantage comes on the question of who would do a better job ""changing business as usual in Washington,"" a key attribute in a year when 53% of those polled want the next president to bring major change to government.
Mr. Trump's advantage on economic issues could give him a boost at a time when half of registered voters rank job creation and economic growth among their top-two issues and 61% say they are still feeling some impact from the recession that ended in 2009, including 69% of Trump supporters and roughly half of Clinton backers.
Two-thirds of voters who want to see major changes in the way government operates favor Mr. Trump.
Mrs. Clinton, in turn, wins a similar share of those voters who prefer a ""steady approach.""
Overall, poll participants give Mrs. Clinton the edge on which candidate is looking out for the middle class, who would appoint the best Supreme Court justices and who would deal with issues of concern to women.
The former secretary of state also has big advantages when it comes to foreign policy -- a potential liability for Mr. Trump -- with voters giving her higher marks at this early stage for being able to serve as commander-in-chief and the ability to navigate the world stage.
The Democratic Party's biggest advantage down the stretch may be structural. President Barack Obama is enjoying a significant uptick in public approval during his final year in the White House, with 51% approving of the job he is doing, the highest tally since his second inauguration in January 2013.
More of those surveyed want a Democrat than a Republican in the White House next year, and the Democratic Party has a much better image than the GOP.
While both candidates have a negative public image among voters overall, nearly half of all registered voters think the results in November will make ""a great deal of difference"" in their daily lives.""
The survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted May 15-19 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
It would be hard to overstate voter unease with the two likely nominees. Asked what words best describe a Clinton presidency, ""liar"" and ""not trustworthy"" were mentioned the most, while ""scared"" and ""disappointed"" were frequently associated with the idea of a President Trump.
More voters expressed very negative views about Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton than they did about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""She's the lesser of two evils,"" said Cesar Saez, 26, of Las Vegas, who favors Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary but would back Mrs. Clinton in a matchup with Mr. Trump. ""She has a much better temperament than Donald Trump.""
""It's not like that I like him, I just don't like her,"" said Charles Kafami, 36, of Fairfax, Va., referring to Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. ""I would vote for a can of Coke over her.""
Some 48% of voters in the survey said they dislike Mr. Trump's approach and style and disagree with him on most issues, while 45% offered similar views about Mrs. Clinton. An additional 26% said they dislike Mr. Trump's style and approach but agree with him on the issues. Some 15% said so of Mrs. Clinton.
More voters in the poll (38%) are indifferent about Mrs. Clinton becoming the first female president than those who express enthusiasm about that prospect (22%), while 16% of registered voters said it makes them uncomfortable.
And the survey suggests Mr. Trump may need to calm concerns about his lack of experience, with 42% saying they are ""very uncomfortable"" that he would be the first president without previous government or military service. Another 19% express some reservations about that.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 respondents who use only a cellphone. It was conducted from May 15-19, 2016, by the polling organizations of Bill McInturff at Public Opinion Strategies and Fred Yang at Hart Research Associates. Individuals were selected proportionate to the nation's population in accordance with a probability sample design that gives all landline telephone numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance to be included. Registered voters age 18 or older were selected by a systematic procedure to provide a balance of respondents by sex. The cellphone sample was drawn from a list of cellphone users nationally. Of the 1,000 interviews, 450 respondents were reached on a cellphone and screened to ensure their cellphone was the only phone they had. In addition, 46 respondents were reached on a cellphone but reported also having a landline. Overall, the data's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The margin of error for subgroups is larger.

Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Hillary Clinton's Complicated Path to Center,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790560660?accountid=12768,"Let's deploy a football metaphor to describe one of Hillary Clinton's dilemmas: There is a great opening for her in the ideological center of the presidential playing field. But right now she is trapped in the backfield by Sen. Bernie Sanders and his supporters, and it's unclear she can break free to seize the opening.
This may be one of the biggest prices Mrs. Clinton is paying for the continuing challenge posed by Mr. Sanders. By pushing her to the ideological left and making clear he will make her pay a price if she doesn't keep pointed that direction, he is standing in the way of her moving toward what should be a natural constituency in the center, and one that Donald Trump may be making more available than usual.
In the normal order of affairs, a presidential candidate tacks to the left in Democratic primaries or to the right in Republican primaries to win over each party's ideological activists and win the nomination. Then a nominee moves subtly back toward the center to broaden his or her appeal to the general-election crowd.
In some ways, Mr. Trump is having to do the opposite. He has sewn up the Republican nomination, but now finds that he has to reassure his party's suspicious conservatives to pull them into line behind him. So in the past week or so he actually has moved to the right, pleasing social conservatives by offering a list of conservative judges he would consider for appointment to the Supreme Court and making a full-throated appeal for gun rights before the National Rifle Association.
That leaves an opening for Mrs. Clinton in the place where she ought to have strong support anyway: among moderates in the political center.
This is where she probably belongs, logically. She is heiress to the Bill Clinton center-left ideology and coalition. She wants an increase in the minimum wage but not a giant increase. She wants to raise taxes on the wealthy but not as much as liberals would like. She favors government activism but proposes ways to pay for it. She is more willing to intervene abroad than is President Barack Obama.
Moreover, she has been reasonably friendly to the business community, which is under attack from both sides and available for the wooing.
So the opening is there, particularly because 57% of self-described moderates hold a negative view of Mr. Trump in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, as do a third of ""soft"" Republicans. More than most groups surveyed, moderates said they are looking for a president with a steady approach rather than one who will bring great change. That sounds like Mrs.Clinton.
But it isn't that easy. Not by a long shot.
Mrs. Clinton is trapped at the moment defending her left flank against continuing attacks from Mr. Sanders, and that figures to be the case right up until the Democratic convention at the end of July. So to the extent she moves to the center, she risks losing her already-tenuous hold on Sanders voters. She will need those liberal Sanders voters at least as badly -- perhaps more badly -- than she will need moderates in a general-election matchup against Mr. Trump.
Moreover, any shifts in position Mrs. Clinton makes as the campaign goes on will risk exacerbating her broader problem, which is that many voters don't see her as honest and trustworthy. That is a potential trap.
Heading toward that trap, Mrs. Clinton would find that her standing in the political center isn't as strong as one might expect, given her background and profile. Among political moderates, she leads Mr. Trump by a mere 2 percentage points, 45% to 43%. By contrast, Mr. Obama won moderates by 15 percentage points over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, exit polls indicated.
Mr. Sanders actually does better among moderates in a hypothetical matchup against Mr. Trump than does Mrs. Clinton, a head-scratching finding if there ever was one.
Six in 10 of those moderates supporting Mrs. Clinton say they actually are opposing Mr. Trump more than supporting her. By a 53% to 32% margin, moderates say they have negative feelings toward Mrs. Clinton personally.
The upshot is that Mrs. Clinton faces competing and contradictory needs. She has to up her appeal among moderates, which should be a natural base of support. Yet she also may find herself in the same kind of position as does Mr. Trump, having to reassure her party's ideological base to ensure its active support despite having won the nomination.
In sum, the opportunity here is very real for Mrs. Clinton. But so is the danger that she ends up in a kind of no-man's-land ideologically,not fully pleasing either those on the left or those in the center.

"Main Street: Sex, Bill Clinton and Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790560377?accountid=12768,"Those of a certain age will recall the 1990s, the good old days when James Carville warned America that only ""an abusive, privacy-invading, sex-obsessed"" hypocrite could even think a president's personal behavior toward women had anything to say about his fitness for public office.
Today it seems like ancient history, now that Donald Trump's treatment of women has become a political issue. True enough, there was a day when Americans would have blanched at the thought of a candidate bragging about his adultery or using a presidential debate to boast about his genitalia. But in the 1990s we learned that only bluenoses care about these things.
We had it from no less than the Big Dawg himself. On Aug. 17, 1998, just hours after a grand jury session in which he'd tussled with prosecutors asking about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, he delivered a defiant, nationally televised address admitting his earlier denials had been misleading. Still, he insisted, whatever he had done with that young intern was between him and his family.
""It's nobody's business but ours,"" he said. ""Even presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on with our national life.""
Even perjury didn't matter in this case, because, as New York Congressman Jerrold Nadler put it, it was ""perjury regarding sex."" All that mattered was that Mr. Clinton was good at his day job.
The American people seemed to agree, with a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll on the eve of the House vote to impeach showing only a third of the public in support.
Here's the kicker: Donald Trump was on the Bill Clinton side of the argument.
For Mr. Trump, this was all much ado about Monica. Mr. Clinton's mistake, he said, was that he'd lied about the sex instead of sticking with the argument it was irrelevant. In a September 1998 New York Times forum that ran under the headline ""Can Clinton Find the Road Back?"" Mr. Trump gave this advice:
""Accept complete responsibility for personal failures, be lucky enough to have enemies with their own shortcomings, and hold steadfast to your political agenda. After the initial shock is past, the American people are less interested in sexual transgressions than they are in public achievements.""
Nearly two decades later, Mr. Trump continues to live by this reading of the American people.
This past week brings more evidence it's working. For no sooner had the New York Times published an expose subtitled ""How Donald Trump Behaved with Women in Private,"" than two women featured complained the Times had twisted their words to fit the reporters' negative narrative. So scarcely a week after it appeared, it is the Times story that has now blown up, not Mr. Trump.
But if Mr. Trump is winning this fight, it's not just because the Times ought to have been more careful. It appears to have escaped the Hillary faithful that Mr. Trump may be winning in good part because he has proved a more steadfast adherent of the Clinton argument of the 1990s than she has.
While at Wellesley, a young Hillary Clinton famously wrote her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky, the community organizer and author of ""Rules for Radicals."" The two kept up a correspondence after she entered law school at Yale, and Alinsky is said to have been a great influence on her thought.
But while Mrs. Clinton may have studied Alinsky, Mr. Trump is showing himself the better Alinskyite. Especially with his use of Rule No. 4: Force your opponents to live up to their rules and values.
There's no better example than the war on women. Mrs. Clinton started out all set to run the standard playbook against what she presumed would be a standard Republican opponent. But Mr. Trump has now turned it on her, putting her in the position of running against her husband.
Whenever Mrs. Clinton brings up women, Mr. Trump throws Bill Clinton right back at her. Indeed, on Monday Mr. Trump released a new attack on Instagram featuring an audio of Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick over the caption: ""Is Hillary really protecting women?""
Mr. Trump is doing all this, moreover, without the slightest apology for his own playboy boorishness. Think of him as Mr. Clinton minus the credible rape and harassment allegations.
The difference is that where Bill lies, The Donald boasts. ""Beautiful, famous, successful, married,"" Mr. Trump wrote about women in his 2008 book ""Think Big."" ""I've had them all.""
In the 1990s, when President Clinton found himself fighting for his presidency after he was caught in a sexual relationship with an intern, he and his allies relentlessly pushed the idea that a pol's private life was just that, private, and all that mattered was his agenda.
These many years later, by choosing Mr. Trump, GOP primary voters have given their answer: Message received.

"Election 2016 -- Analysis: Trump, Clinton Both In Popularity Pickle",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792119334?accountid=12768,"By now, it is broadly accepted that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump generate a lot of negative vibes among voters. Less appreciated, perhaps, is how broad those bad vibes are, and how much they extend into segments of the electorate that normally would be more enthused.
A look deeper into the sentiments of key electoral groups in the latestWall Street Journal/NBC News pollgives a fuller picture of just how unusual the public's views of the two parties' presumptive nominees really are. Mr. Trump generates more negative than positive feelings among groups usually sympathetic toward a Republican presidential contender, and Mrs. Clinton does the same among groups normally upbeat about a Democratic presidential front-runner.
""I have never seen anything like this,"" says Bill McInturff, a veteran Republican pollster who conducts the Journal/NBC News survey with Democrat Fred Yang.
In each Journal/NBC News poll, Americans are asked to rate their feelings toward a group of prominent figures as positive, negative or neutral. A lot of attention has been focused on the fact that, overall, those surveyed report net negative feelings toward each candidate, and by a wide margin. For Mrs. Clinton, 34% of respondents overall said they had positive feelings, while 54% said they had negative feelings. For Mr. Trump, the reading was even worse: 29% positive, 58% negative.
Such readings might not be so bad for each candidate if the negative sentiment were all coming from groups that you would expect to be hostile to a Republican or a Democrat. The problem each has right now is that the bad vibes are coming in part from some groups that ought to be more positive.
Mr. Trump, for example, has net positive ratings among Republicans by a 33-point margin -- though that is well below the 52-point net positive reading Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, had at this point. Mr. Trump also has a net 13-point positive rating among self-described conservatives, though again, that is almost 20 points lower than Mr. Romney had.
The problem lies in the sentiments found in some groups that have been key for Republican contenders in recent cycles. His rating is a net negative of 28 points among suburban voters, 29 points among those in households with more than $75,000 in annual income, and a whopping 36 points among whites with a college education.
For her part, Mrs. Clinton isnet positive among a handful of core groups: Democrats generally, self-described liberals, Latinos and black voters. Among African-Americans, her net positive is a healthy 63 points, though the same group gave President Barack Obama a net 89-point reading at this point in 2012.
The problems for Mrs. Clinton lie elsewhere. Young voters aged 18 through 34, with whom she has struggled to gain ground against Sen. Bernie Sanders, give her a net negative rating of 21 points. Women age 50 or older are negative by 15 points, a reflection of the fact that Mrs. Clinton, though on her way to becoming the first female nominee of a major party, lags among married women. And self-described independent voters give her a net negative rating of 40 points. Mr. Obama had a net positive rating of 11 points in 2012.
Still, there may be a silver lining in all those clouds for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. Their standing with such groups may be low now, but those also are audiences that should be open to revising their views toward the Democratic or Republican standard-bearer. And the two presumptive nominees have more than five months remaining before Election Day to make that happen.

Declarations: Clinton Embodies Washington's Decadence,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792119123?accountid=12768,"The most interesting thing Donald Trump has said recently isn't his taunting of Hillary Clinton, it's his comment to Bloomberg's Joshua Green. Mr. Green writes: ""Many politicians, Trump told me, had privately confessed to being amazed that his policies, and his lacerating criticism of party leaders, had proved such potent electoral medicine."" Mr. Trump seemed to ""intuit,"" Mr. Green writes, that standard Republican dogma on entitlements and immigration no longer holds sway with large swaths of the party electorate. Mr. Trump says he sees his supporters as part of ""a movement.""
What, Mr. Green asked, would the party look like in five years? ""Love the question,"" Mr. Trump replied. ""Five, 10 years from now -- different party. You're going to have a worker's party. A party of people that haven't had a real wage increase in 18 years.""
My impression on reading this was that Mr. Trump is seeing it as a party of regular people, as the Democratic Party was when I was a child and the Republican Party when I was a young woman.
This is the first thing I've seen that suggests Mr. Trump is ideologically conscious of what he's doing. It's not just ego and orange hair, he suggests, it's politically intentional.
It invites many questions. Movements require troops -- not only supporters on the ground, but an army of enthusiastic elected officials and activists. Mr. Trump doesn't have that army. Washington hates what he stands for and detests the idea he represents policy change. GOP elites will have to start thinking about two things: the rock-bottom purpose of the party and the content, in 2016, of a conservatism reflective of and responsive to this moment and the next. This will be necessary whatever happens to Mr. Trump, because big parts of the base are speaking through him. It is no surprise so many D.C. conservatives are hissing, screeching and taking names. They're in the middle of something epochal that they did not expect. They're lost.
To another part of the Trump phenomenon that does not involve policy, exactly:
When Mr. Trump went after Mrs. Clinton over her husband's terrible treatment of women -- she was his ""unbelievably nasty, mean enabler"" -- my first thought was: Man, I thought it was supposed to get bloody in October. This is May -- where will we wind up? But I was struck that no friend on the left seemed shocked or appalled. A few on the right were delighted, and some unsure. Isn't this the sort of thing that's supposed to turn women off and make Hillary look like a victim?
But so far Mr. Trump's numbers seem to be edging up.
I was surprised that if Mr. Trump was going to go there early, he didn't focus on a central political depredation of the Clinton wars. That was after Mrs. Clinton learned of the Monica scandal and did not step back, claiming a legitimate veil of personal privacy -- after all, it was not she who had been accused of terrible Oval Office behavior -- but came forward on ""Today"" as an aggressor. Knowing her husband's history, knowing his sickness, having every reason to believe the charges were true, she attacked her husband's critics, in a particular way: ""The great story here . . . is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president . . . . Some folks are gonna have a lot to answer for.""
She was speaking this way about conservatives, half or more of the country. At a charged moment she took a personal humiliation and turned it into a political weapon, which further divided the nation, pitching left against right. She did this because her first instinct is always war. If you have to divide the country to protect your position by all means divide the country. It was unprotective of the country, and so unpatriotic.
The lack of backlash against Mr. Trump's attacks on Mrs. Clinton, though, I suspect is due to something else. It's that the subject matter really comes down to one word: decadence. People right now will respect a political leader who will name and define what they themselves see as the utter decadence of Washington.
I don't mean that they watch ""Scandal"" and ""House of Cards"" and think those shows are a slightly over-the-top version of reality, though they do. Now and then I meet a young person who, finding I'd worked in a White House, asks, half-humorously and I swear half-curiously, if I ever saw anyone kill a reporter by throwing her under a train. I say I knew people who would have liked to but no, train-station murders weren't really a thing then. (Someday cultural historians will wonder if the lowered political standards that mark this year were at all connected to our national habit of watching mass entertainment in which our elites are presented as high-functioning psychopaths. Yes, that may have contributed to a certain lowering of real-world standards.)
But the real decadence Americans see when they look at Washington is an utterly decadent system. Just one famous example from the past few years:
A high official in the IRS named Lois Lerner targets those she finds politically hateful. IRS officials are in the White House a lot, which oddly enough finds the same people hateful. News of the IRS targeting is about to break because an inspector general is on the case, so Ms. Lerner plants a question at a conference, answers with a rehearsed lie, tries to pin the scandal on workers in a cubicle farm in Cincinnati, lies some more, gets called into Congress, takes the Fifth -- and then retires with full pension and benefits, bonuses intact. Taxpayers will be footing the bill for years for the woman who in some cases targeted them, and blew up the reputation of the IRS.
Why wouldn't Americans think the system is rigged?
This is Washington in our era: a place not so much of personal as of civic decadence, where the Lois Lerner always gets away with it.
Which brings us to the State Department Office of Inspector General's report involving Hillary Clinton's emails. It reveals one big thing: Almost everything she has said publicly about her private server was a lie. She lied brazenly, coolly, as one who is practiced in lying would, as one who always gets away with it could.
No, she was not given legal approval to conduct her business on the server. She was not given the impression it was fine. She did not comply with rules on storage and archiving. Her own office told U.S. diplomats personal email accounts could be compromised and they must avoid using them for official business. She was informed of a dramatic increase in hacking attempts on personal accounts. Professionals who raised concerns about her private server were told not to speak of it again.
It is widely assumed that Mrs. Clinton will pay no price for misbehavior because the Democratic president's Justice Department is not going to proceed with charges against the likely Democratic presidential nominee.
This is what everyone thinks, and not only because they watch ""Scandal."" Because they watch the news.
That is the civic decadence they want to see blown up. And there's this orange-colored bomb . . .

Donald Trump Says 'Second Amendment People' Can Stop Hillary Clinton From Curbing Gun Rights; GOP candidate made remark while warning supporters of rival's judge picks,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810155494?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday that ""the Second Amendment people"" could potentially stop Hillary Clinton from taking away gun rights should she become president.
""Hillary wants to abolish--essentially abolish the Second Amendment. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,"" he said at a rally in Wilmington, N.C. ""Although the Second Amendment people--maybe there is, I don't know.""
The remark, which Mrs. Clinton's campaign immediately charged was an incitement to violence, escalated the aggressive tone of a campaign in which Mr. Trump's appearances are regularly disrupted by protesters and Mr. Trump's supporters routinely chant ""Lock her up"" at campaign events.
Mr. Trump's spokesman Jason Miller responded in a statement: ""Second Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power. And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won't be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump.""
Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook said Mr. Trump's remark was ""dangerous.""
""A person seeking to be the president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way,"" Mr. Mook said in a statement.

Trump Defends Tying ISIS to Obama; Republican presidential candidate stands by remarks calling Obama the 'founder' of ISIS and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton the 'co-founder',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810713239?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump defended his remarks calling President Barack Obama the ""founder"" of ISIS and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton the ""co-founder.""
Mr. Trump first made the charge at a rally Wednesday in Florida, claiming the terror group, also known as Islamic State, or ISIL, ""honors"" Mr. Obama. In fact, the Obama administration has launched numerous attacks on ISIS in Iraq and Syria, harming the group.
Radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Thursday if he meant to say that Mr. Obama indirectly created ISIS by creating a power vacuum in Iraq when he pulled most troops from the country. ""No,"" Mr. Trump replied. ""I meant he's the founder of ISIS. He was the most valuable player.""
When Mr. Hewitt said Democrats would seize on the ""founder"" comment to attack Mr. Trump's foreign policy views, Mr. Trump repeated that he hadn't erred. ""Everyone's liking it,"" he said.
In a statement, Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan said: ""This is a false claim from a presidential candidate with an aversion to the truth and an unprecedented lack of knowledge.""
A White House spokesman declined to comment.
Asked in a CNBC interview how he plans to close the gap in recent polling that shows him falling behind in critical swing states, Mr. Trump said he didn't plan to change his campaigning style.
""Just keep doing the same thing I'm doing right now,"" he said about his efforts to win the race. ""And at the end it's either going to work, or I'm going you know, I'm going to have a very, very nice long vacation.""

Trump and Clinton Will Go Down in History--For a While; Politicians think the White House brings immortality. But the world has already forgotten President Hayes.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810982091?accountid=12768,"Somewhere in America, just after 2 o'clock on a steamy summer afternoon, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were out making their rounds, seeking to become a permanent part of the nation's history. On East William Street in Delaware, Ohio, I was the only person in front of the BP gas station, looking toward a small patch of dirt and sparse foliage.
Near the gas pumps, a Bud Light delivery truck had just parked. Its driver, on foot, noisily wheeled some silver-colored kegs of beer past where I stood. Traffic on William Street was fairly heavy, but as far as I could tell not a single motorist glanced over toward the object that had caught my eye.
""Very few people even realize it's here,"" the owner of the gas station, Jean Khanjian, told me. ""I don't think it has any effect on our business, either way.""
What I was looking at was a weathered plaque declaring that the spot where the pumps stand ($2.05 a gallon on this Midwestern day) was the birthplace of Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States. It has been almost a hundred years since the house where his mother gave birth to him--his father had died during her pregnancy--was torn down.
All the frenzied striving by a different crop of candidates every four years for the enduring eminence that comes with the presidency, all the time and hope put into overcoming the odds that will keep all but one from making it to the White House--all of it, as we're seeing this summer, is so perpetually present-tense and seemingly urgent. And yet. . .
The Upper Cut barber shop was next door, a pizza place called Amato's diagonally across the street. There was a black rubber hose snaked around the base of the plaque, which has been here since 1926 through a succession of different gas-station proprietors. No water emerged from the mouth of the hose, and some of the dirt had cracked in the heat.
Only 400 or so people lived in Delaware in 1822, when the baby was born to his just-widowed mother. Hayes is not a president about whom many people give much thought these days. He served a single term, from 1877 to 1881, preceded by Ulysses S. Grant and succeeded by James A. Garfield. But still, when a president comes from a small town, you might think his birthplace would be commemorated in grander fashion.
""Indeed,"" the head of the Delaware County Historical Society, Brent Carson, told me when I sought him out. ""It's not really befitting of a president of the United States. There's not even a place on the street for a car to park so a driver can get out."" Is there any presidential birthplace in the U.S. marked as modestly as this one at the gas station? ""I can't imagine,"" Mr. Carson said.
The cable newscasts on this afternoon were wall-to-wall with reports about Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton and their parallel quests to become the 45th president. One day the place where one of them was born will become a draw for sightseers, part of the immortality that automatically accompanies victory.
""We're proud that a president was born here,"" said R. Thomas Homan, the city manager of Delaware. ""But is that gas station a destination for tourists? I would have to say no.""
Not that the town is indifferent. Last year a committee was set up to devise a more proper tribute to President Hayes. The chairman of the committee was an 18-year-old senior at Rutherford B. Hayes High School, Cory Beam, who told me that he gave up playing varsity baseball this spring--he was a starting pitcher--to work on the project.
""The plaque's not even legible anymore,"" he said. ""You can hardly read it. People walk by like it's not even there. That's not the way a president from your town should be remembered.""
Mr. Beam--he's leaving Delaware to go to college this fall--and his committee recently presented a plan to the city's leaders. If funding can be found, a statue of Rutherford B. Hayes would be erected in a plaza that would be designed nearby, with a fountain and a place for visitors to sit. Although the plaza would not be on the precise site where Hayes was born, the statue's eyes would be looking directly at the BP station where the house once stood.
On this afternoon a woman gassed up her gray Toyota Camry. With a dog in her back seat she turned left onto William Street. She accelerated first past the plaque and then past St. Mark's Lutheran Church, and there is, in the end, an unexpected sort of grandeur to this place. It is the indisputable affirmation of an American truth. The old promise is real:
From a spot like this one, all the way to the White House. You can get there from here.

Clinton Abandons the Middle on Education; Most rank-and-file Democrats disagree with the party platform.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811235629?accountid=12768,"Throughout this campaign season, Democrats have feigned confusion about why disaffected Republicans have not embraced Hillary Clinton, given Donald Trump's character defects. But the K-12 education plank in the Democratic Party platform does a lot to explain the hesitance. The party's promises seem designed to satisfy teachers unions rather than to appeal to ordinary Democrats, much less opposition moderates.
Democrats say that they will ""recognize and honor all the professionals who work in public schools,"" including ""teachers, education support professionals, and specialized staff,"" suggesting that every teacher does a terrific job. The party also promises that it will ""end the test-and-punish version of accountability."" Only charter schools seem to need more scrutiny: The platform includes a full paragraph of ideas to regulate them.
Democrats nationwide seem to have a different view. Like Republicans, Democrats have a positive view of most teachers, but their confidence does not extend to all of them. Democrats and Republicans both think that nearly 60% of teachers in their local schools are either excellent or good, and another quarter at least satisfactory. But Democrats find up to 15% of teachers unsatisfactory. It doesn't seem like rank-and-file Democrats are ready to honor all teachers and simply trust them.
These are some of the data Education Next reveals in a survey to be published next week. Over the course of May and June our publication surveyed 700 teachers and 3,500 other Americans. The results demonstrate how out of touch the Democratic Party has become on education.
In contrast with platform-committee Democrats, 80% of rank-and-file adherents who took a position on the issue said they backed the federal requirement that ""all students be tested in math and reading each year,"" with only 20% disagreeing. Republicans had similar responses: 74% and 26%, respectively.
As for punishing and rewarding teachers, 57% of Democrats nationwide said they supported ""basing part of the salaries of teachers on how much their students learn."" Fifty-nine percent said teacher tenure should be eliminated.
For their platform, party insiders voted to ""support enabling parents to opt their children out of standardized tests."" But Democrats nationwide do not share this view. When asked whether they favored ""letting parents decide whether to have their children take state math and reading tests,"" 71% of Democrats said they did not. So did 69% of Republicans.
Democrats in Philadelphia also suggested that they ""will end the school-to-prison pipeline by opposing discipline policies which disproportionately affect African-Americans and Latinos."" But 61% of Democrats around the country oppose federal policies that ""prevent schools from expelling and suspending black and Hispanic students at higher rates than other students."" So do 86% of Republicans, and a majority of both African-American and Hispanic respondents who take a side.
Democratic honchos qualify their support for charter schools by asserting that they ""should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools""--not a good sign since it is impossible for charters to enroll more students without contraction elsewhere. But when Democrats nationwide were asked whether they supported ""the formation of charter schools,"" 58% of those with a position said yes, as did 74% of Republicans.
It isn't clear who wrote these lines in the Democratic Party platform. But teachers unions have for years battled testing, accountability and merit pay. They push parental ""opt out"" as a backdoor way to kill testing, and the unions are doing their best to prevent charter schools from expanding. On discipline policies, the support is coming from civil-rights groups and the Obama administration.
If the views of rank-and-file Democrats don't count, and party leaders care little about the political center, it's hard to see how Mrs. Clinton could turn victory into a governing majority.

Clinton Shifts to California,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793067384?accountid=12768,"California is shaping up as a showdown between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, with Tuesday's primary threatening to prevent Mrs. Clinton from a strong finish to the long primary season that would make it easier for her to unify the party ahead of the general election.
Mrs. Clinton cut short a campaign swing this week in New Jersey, where she is favored in its Tuesday primary, so that she could spend more time stumping in California. The campaign also announced on Wednesday that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, would be in the state from Thursday through Monday, helping to reach more voters.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll found the former secretary of state and the Vermont senator deadlocked in the state, raising the possibility of a win by Mr. Sanders, which would give him confidence to carry his campaign into the party's Philadelphia convention next month.
Mrs. Clinton leads the Vermont senator by just two percentage points among likely Democratic primary voters, 49% to 47%, well within the survey's margin of error. The poll signals a closer contest than was expected just a few weeks ago.
Mrs. Clinton essentially has the nomination locked up, thanks to her lead in pledged delegates and the strong support of superdelegates, who are mostly Democratic elected officials. Because pledged delegates are awarded proportionate to the vote, Mrs. Clinton can lose the California primary and others on June 7 and still win the final delegates she needs to clinch the presidential nomination.
Currently, Mrs. Clinton has 2,312 delegates, or 71 short of the 2,383 needed, according to the Associated Press's tally. Mr. Sanders has 1,545 delegates. Nearly 700 delegates will be allocated on June 7, including 475 pledged delegates from California.
Recent polls in California have produced widely varying pictures of the race, with some finding Mrs. Clinton holding a double-digit lead. Voter preferences may be changing as the vote nears, accounting for the differing results.
The fate of Mr. Sanders's presidential bid rides heavily on the outcome in California, the last major contest of the primary season. He has underscored the importance of the state by campaigning in California every day since May 21.
As the contest shifts to the general election, a Clinton loss in California would cast a shadow over her campaign while she tries to unify the Democratic Party after an unexpectedly competitive -- and divisive -- primary. In particular, she needs to make inroads among the younger voters and independent voters who have fueled Mr. Sanders's campaign, some of whom might back presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.
On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton will be in San Diego to deliver a speech expected to challenge the foreign-policy positions laid out by Mr. Trump. On the trail recently, she has directed her fire at Mr. Trump, not at Mr. Sanders.
The new Journal/NBC News/Marist poll found Mr. Sanders building big margins among younger voters, as he has in other states. Among Democratic primary voters age 18 to 29, the poll found, 80% favor Mr. Sanders, while Mrs. Clinton garners almost twice his support among primary voters age 45 and older.
Mr. Sanders also outpaces Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin, 72% to 28%, among those voters who would be participating for the first time.
""We are seeing a familiar pattern in what is the last major pre-convention collision between Clinton and Sanders,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ""Age is the story in this California toss-up. Sanders inspires younger or first-time voters, and Clinton relies upon those who are older or have participated in the last.""
The good news for Mrs. Clinton is that it looks like she has already banked a larger share of the early vote. She leads among those Californians who have already cast ballots, 58% to 41%.
Mr. Sanders holds a slight lead, 49% to 46%, among Latino voters, who account for more than a quarter of likely Democratic primary voters. Some of these interviews were conducted in Spanish.
The Clintons are well-known figures in California, with broad support in the entertainment and high-technology worlds. But Mr. Sanders has gained traction in the state as voters have gotten to know the self-described democratic socialist.
""The Democratic Party in California is probably the most liberal Democratic Party in the country,"" said John Burton, chairman of California's party.
Mr. Sanders has gone all-in, packing his schedule with appearances up and down the state. On Wednesday, at a news conference in Spreckles, Calif., Mr. Sanders criticized his rival for not supporting a nationwide ban on ""fracking.""
Mrs. Clinton has taken the position that she would support ""fracking"" under limited circumstances, and that, at present, the practice is not ""sufficiently regulated"" in certain locations.
The poll casts doubt on Mr. Trump's recent claim that he will make California competitive in the fall. Mrs. Clinton leads him by 24 percentage points, 55% to 31%, with 6% undecided and 8% saying they would not vote for either. Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump by an even wider margin, 62% to 28%, with 10% saying they were either undecided or not supportive of either.
In the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, Democrat Kamala Harris, the state's attorney general, leads the field as the preferred pick of 37% of primary voters. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a fellow Democrat, is in a solid second place, with 19%.
California's open primary system allows the top two finishers in next week's Senate primary to advance to the general election.
California is one of six states to hold Democratic nominating contests on June 7, along with Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.
The poll of 557 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted May 29-31 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

Election 2016: Clinton Hits Trump Over His Defunct School,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793063304?accountid=12768,"NEWARK, N.J. -- Hillary Clinton seized on Donald Trump's legal troubles over a defunct real estate school on Wednesday, calling him a ""fraud"" who is ""trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U.""
""Trump and his employees took advantage of vulnerable Americans, encouraging them to max out their credit cards, empty their retirement savings, destroy their financial futures -- all while making promises they knew were false from the beginning,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said at a rally ahead of New Jersey's primary on Tuesday.
Mrs. Clinton's comments -- some her sharpest rebukes to date of the presumptive Republican nominee -- came a day after documents were made public by Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California that disclosed some of the aggressive sales tactics the school used to entice prospective students.
The documents relate to a California lawsuit brought by ex-students that accuses Mr. Trump and his former Trump University of tricking people into spending thousands of dollars on seminars with false promises of access to Mr. Trump and his real estate secrets.
Mr. Trump also faces a separate case in New York, where state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's civil lawsuit alleges Trump University lacked proper licensing and defrauded thousands of students.
Mr. Trump has denied the allegations, saying Trump University students got their money's worth. ""She's got it wrong,"" he said in a statement Wednesday, in response to Mrs. Clinton's comments. ""I will win my case in court. Thousands of people signed student evaluations saying the courses were excellent.""
Mrs. Clinton, referring to the New York case, told the crowd: ""I want you to hear this: His own employees testified that Trump U -- you can't make this up -- that Trump U was a fraudulent scheme where Donald Trump enriched himself at the expense of hardworking people.""
Mrs. Clinton, who made no mention of her Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, attacked Mr. Trump on other fronts Wednesday, including foreign policy and what she described as his sensitivity to media coverage.
Referring to a news conference the New York businessman held Tuesday in which he excoriated reporters for examining his record of charitable donations, among other matters, Mrs. Clinton said: ""If you're in public life you're not always going to like what the press says about you. I have some experience with that. But part of the genius of our democracy, our system, is we have a free press.""
Meanwhile, President Barack Obama stepped into the 2016 campaign Wednesday, offering voters an optimistic vision of the country's economic future and delivering a harsh critique of Mr. Trump, though he didn't mention him by name.
Mr. Obama, speaking in Elkhart, Ind., said the GOP agenda is ""antigovernment, anti-immigrant, antitrade"" and serves as cover for policies that benefit the wealthy over the middle class while preying on Americans' lingering economic anxiety to win votes.

Why Clinton Should Fear ObamaCare,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793056943?accountid=12768,"Will ObamaCare be a top issue in this fall's presidential and congressional campaigns? Republicans better make it one if they want to prevail.
The continuing unpopularity of President Obama's signature domestic achievement gives Republicans an enormous opportunity. Only 39.2% of Americans favor ObamaCare in the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls; nearly half, 48.8%, oppose it. There's also a sharp partisan divide that benefits the GOP: While 78% of Democrats approve of ObamaCare, according to an April survey from the Pew Research Center, 58% of independents and 89% of Republicans disapprove of it.
Those numbers are unlikely to improve as insurers are forced to ask for drastic premium increases, driven by the fact that ObamaCare policyholders are older and sicker than the government had forecast.
Take Florida, this year's most critical presidential battleground, which also features an open race for Marco Rubio's U.S. Senate seat. Insurance companies there are asking regulators for an average premium increase of 17.7% for individual coverage under ObamaCare and 9.6% for small-group plans.
Or check out other key battleground states, many with marquee Senate races as well: The largest insurer in Virginia is seeking a 15.8% premium increase, while another major provider is requesting 16.6%. In Iowa, Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield has written customers to warn premiums might rise by 38% to 43% next year. The company says that last year it spent $1.27 on ObamaCare policies for every $1 in premiums.
The second-largest ObamaCare provider in New Hampshire is seeking a premium increase of 45.2%. Pennsylvania's insurers have so far asked for increases averaging 23.6% for the individual market and 7.9% for small-group plans. Moreover, fewer insurance companies are offering ObamaCare policies, reducing competition.
This is a national trend as insurers discover that all the federal tax dollars being lavished on ObamaCare plans don't make them profitable. Many insurance companies lose money on each ObamaCare policy they issue, weakening their long-term finances. The largest health insurer in the country, UnitedHealth, pulled out of ObamaCare in 27 states after losing $475 million on that business last year. The company may quit most of the remaining exchanges, too.
Ohio is the quintessential and near-eternal presidential tossup. This year it also has a critical Senate contest. Insurers there have yet to file rate requests for next year, but last week the state's nonprofit ObamaCare co-op shut down. Simply to break even, it reportedly would have needed premium increases of 60%. Twenty-three states organized such co-ops: 13 have closed. Of the 10 still standing, all are in financial difficulty and Illinois's has stopped writing new policies.
Most voters will not be directly affected by these events. Only roughly 6% of Americans participate in ObamaCare (including those added to the Medicaid rolls), and many receive generous taxpayer subsidies that shelter them from premium increases.
But news of ObamaCare's troubles -- along with bigger copays and deductibles in private plans -- stirs up Republicans and independents. It reminds them of Mr. Obama's many other broken promises, such as when he said that he would ""cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year,"" or the infamous pledge that ""if you like your plan, you can keep your plan."" ObamaCare is a gateway to the broader issue of the president's lack of credibility, on this and many other issues.
Republicans and their presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, have aimed most of their fire in recent months at Mrs. Clinton, allowing the president partial obscurity that helped him improve his favorable ratings. Attacking ObamaCare can drive those numbers down again and remind voters that a first term for Mrs. Clinton is a third term for Mr. Obama.
Raising ObamaCare in the election also forces Hillary and every Democratic Senate and House candidate to defend the indefensible. This further paints them as creatures of the status quo, when voters desperately want change.
But to exploit this opportunity, Republicans must campaign on credible, substantive alternatives to ObamaCare. Thankfully, conservative think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and GOP lawmakers -- including Reps. Tom Price, Pete Sessions and Mike Burgess and Sens. Bill Cassidy and John Barrasso -- have churned out proposals and drafted legislation.
It will take a willingness to engage on health care and a confident mastery of the alternatives for Republicans to make ObamaCare's massive failures a big political winner. With five months until Election Day, there's still time -- but not that much -- to study up.

Clinton Launches Broadside At Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793509429?accountid=12768,"SAN DIEGO -- Hillary Clinton delivered an opening salvo in her expected November showdown with Donald Trump, a withering portrait of his foreign-policy positions as uninformed, unsophisticated and ""dangerous.""
In an address Thursday before a crowd of supporters here, the Democratic presidential front-runner used humor, contempt and the presumptive Republican nominee's own words to make her case that America would make a ""historic mistake"" by electing Mr. Trump president and making him the commander in chief.
""Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different,"" she said. ""They are dangerously incoherent. They are not even really ideas -- just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.""
Mr. Trump -- who has argued that America's standing in the world has declined under President Barack Obama and would continue to slide if Mrs. Clinton is elected -- slammed Mrs. Clinton's speech in an interview on Thursday. ""It wasn't a foreign-policy speech, it was a hate speech,"" he said. ""She can't talk about foreign policy because she's made so many mistakes.""
Mr. Trump, speaking Thursday evening in San Jose, echoed those points later and called Mrs. Clinton's speech ""pathetic.""
Mrs. Clinton's address likely marks the beginning of a general-election debate that will be bruising. Mr. Trump already has begun portraying Mrs. Clinton as untrustworthy, a tack designed to play on her biggest vulnerability with voters.
Mr. Trump also has highlighted the attack on a U.S. compound in Libya that led to the death of a U.S. ambassador and others while Mrs. Clinton was head of the State Department. In a March debate, he accused her of failing to intervene to save those who were killed in Benghazi. ""Guess what, when the phone rang, she wasn't there,"" he said.
The speech came as Mrs. Clinton is locked in a tough race with Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of California's primary on Tuesday. Mr. Trump was scheduled to speak Thursday night at a campaign rally in San Jose, Calif.
Mrs. Clinton made clear on Thursday her principal line of attack will be on Mr. Trump's temperament and unpredictability. ""He is not just unprepared -- he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,"" she said. Noting that the president has the power to launch nuclear weapons, she added: ""Do we want him making those calls -- someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?""
In his interview, Mr. Trump dismissed Mrs. Clinton's questions about his temperament. ""If people want to win, they need a temperament like mine,"" he said. ""If people want to stagnate and go down, they need a temperament like Crooked Hillary.""
Polls show that foreign policy is one of Mrs. Clinton's biggest advantages over Mr. Trump. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last month found 56% of voters said Mrs. Clinton would be better able to handle foreign policy, compared with 29% who picked Mr. Trump. The survey gave her a 10-point advantage on who would be the better commander in chief.
The two candidates' approaches to foreign policy are markedly different. Mrs. Clinton is considered a hawk of the left, willing to take risks and engage in overseas skirmishes in order to project U.S. power and protect key alliances. She has spent more than two decades criticizing China's human-rights record and has referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""bully.""
But she has faced criticism for not anticipating the chaotic results of the Arab spring that began in late 2010, which toppled several governments and continues to fuel Mideast wars. Republicans will also highlight Mrs. Clinton's support for the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump called a disaster on Thursday, and the scandal over her use of a private email server as secretary of state.
Mr. Trump has characterized his foreign-policy vision as ""America First."" He has called for increasing the size of the U.S. military, but using it more sparingly. He would pull back from global conflicts that he believes don't serve any U.S. interest, and let foreign countries defend themselves.
Mrs. Clinton questioned Mr. Trump's seemingly admiring comments about Mr. Putin, which Mr. Trump has said were taken out of context; his dismissal of the threat posed by North Korea leader Kim Jong Un; and his statement that the Chinese government acted with strength in ending protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. She added that she would ""leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.""
Mrs. Clinton's speech was equal parts talking up her own record and trying to shred her GOP rival's. She mentioned twice that she was in the White House's Situation Room when Mr. Obama gave the order to kill Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and she contrasted this with Mr. Trump's business career, which has included the development of golf courses and casinos.
""There's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf course deal, but it doesn't work like that in world affairs,"" she said.
Just a few hours before Mrs. Clinton's broadside, Mr. Obama offered a more subtle critique of Mr. Trump's foreign-policy approach. ""We cannot turn inward, we cannot give in to isolationism,"" Mr. Obama told graduates at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. ""That's a false comfort.""
Mr. Trump has, at times, backtracked on some of his more controversial statements. He had insisted that he would direct the U.S. military to torture terror suspects, but reversed course and said he would instead seek to change the Geneva Conventions to allow more aggressive interrogation techniques.
Mr. Trump has said his readiness to challenge existing U.S. policy is what is needed to reassert global leadership and prevent other countries from ""laughing at us.""
""When you rattle someone, that's good,"" Mr. Trump said recently in North Dakota. ""If they're rattled in a friendly way, that's a good thing.""
He has also said that Mexico and China fleece the U.S. with dodgy trade practices, and that terror groups have exploited weak immigration laws to infiltrate European and U.S. cities. He has demanded that countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia pay the U.S. for military protection, or he will withdraw military support.

"Clinton's Lawyer, Under Oath",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793508854?accountid=12768,"The news out of last week's Cheryl Mills deposition was that the Clinton confidante didn't say much about Hillary's email server. Which only goes to show that Mrs. Clinton has a serious problem -- and she knows it.
This is, after all, Cheryl Mills. For more than 20 years, she has served as the Clintons' very own Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel in ""Pulp Fiction"") -- their fixer, their problem-solver. From impeachment right up through Benghazi and the server, Ms. Mills is the one constant in the behind-the-scenes obstruction. The less she talks, the more alarm bells ought to ring.
This was the measure to watch when Ms. Mills arrived last Friday to sit for an interview with attorneys for Judicial Watch, which has sued the State Department over missing federal records.
In early May the oversight group convinced a federal judge to order discovery into the creation and operation of Mrs. Clinton's private server. Judicial Watch was granted permission to depose seven central figures, including Ms. Mills, who served as Hillary's aide at the State Department and later as her private lawyer.
Mrs. Clinton claims she set up the home-brew server in an innocent act aimed at convenience, so it was notable that Ms. Mills marched into her deposition accompanied by no fewer than seven lawyers -- three representing Ms. Mills herself, and two each from the Justice and State departments. Two of the government lawyers made clear that they were not only representing their departments but also guarding Ms. Mills in her capacity as a former federal employee. This is President Obama's assist for Mrs. Clinton.
The lawyers earned their pay. The entire 270-page transcript of the deposition, which Judicial Watch released Tuesday, has an almost eye-glazing repetition about it.
A persistent Judicial Watch attorney attempts to ask Ms. Mills a straightforward question. Before she even finishes, Ms. Mills's army of attorneys falls all over itself to object, to insist that the query is outside the ""scope"" of the inquiry or too vague, and to instruct the witness not to answer.
On the rare occasions that they do allow Ms. Mills to open her mouth, it is only after coaching her on what is a permissible response. Not that they need to worry, as Ms. Mills appears to have lived on a distant planet the past several decades.
She doesn't ""know"" or can't ""recall"" even basic facts or conversations. ""I don't recall having such discussions."" ""I can't speak"" to that. ""I don't have a recollection of doing so."" ""I don't know the answer to that question.""
She can't, or won't, make a direct statement even about her own honesty. ""Are there any reasons why you would not be able to answer truthfully here today?"" asks the Judicial Watch attorney. ""Not that I know of,"" Ms. Mills responds, suggesting that there may be reasons she's lying, but that she probably won't recall them until later.
In the spirit of looking cooperative, Ms. Mills did on occasion natter away, filling time with utterly irrelevant factoids about State Department org charts and her interest in Haiti and food security. In this way, she managed to spend most of a day evading and stonewalling every relevant question.
Ms. Mills can barely recall any conversation with anyone while at the State Department about a server, or email, or anything. She is clueless or mum on why the server came to be or who knew about it, or how it worked.
Notably, the Mills team spends much of the interview suggesting she had no real knowledge of the system while on the federal payroll. Why does the timing matter? Because Ms. Mills began working as a private lawyer for Mrs. Clinton after they left government. Anything she learned at that point is therefore protected by attorney-client privilege. Which is convenient.
Frustrating as this surely was for Judicial Watch and the nation, it can't have been surprising. The Clintons haven't survived all these years without the support of talented people, and Ms. Mills -- give her credit -- is unrivaled when it comes to protecting her bosses. Her deposition was something approaching performance art, a perfectly crafted mix of polite ignorance, purposeful misdirection and clever defense.
Yet the presence of all those lawyers proves that Ms. Mills knows she, and her boss, could have a major problem.
What is Bryan Pagliano, the former Clinton IT specialist, telling the FBI under his reported immunity deal? Will it conflict with the Mills deposition? (Interestingly, Mr. Pagliano recently announced he intends to plead the Fifth at his upcoming Judicial Watch deposition.) And what does federal Judge Emmet Sullivan think when he reads the transcript of the Mills runaround? He ordered this discovery to get answers, and it's eminently clear that Ms. Mills is deliberately not giving them.
Her performance is all anyone needs to know about Mrs. Clinton's guilt in the server scandal. Someone who set up a home-brew email system for ""convenience"" wouldn't need people like Cheryl Mills.

Election 2016: California's Brown Endorses Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792700753?accountid=12768,"Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, dwelling less on her credentials for the job than on the need to stop Republican Donald Trump.
Mr. Brown, a popular governor who ran against Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential race, said he would vote for Mrs. Clinton in next Tuesday's California primary. He also praised her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying Mr. Sanders's focus on income inequality echoed his own message in the 1992 race.
In a statement, Mr. Brown recited the Democratic primary vote and delegate totals that have vaulted Mrs. Clinton to what he described as an ""insurmountable"" lead. Democrats, he wrote, have shown ""that they want her as their nominee.""
""This is no time for Democrats to keep fighting each other,"" Mr. Brown said. ""The general election has already begun. Hillary Clinton, with her long experience, especially as secretary of state, has a firm grasp of the issues and will be prepared to lead our country on Day One.""
Mr. Brown criticized Mr. Trump's positions on climate change, citing past comments in which Mr. Trump referred to global warming as a ""hoax."" He also faulted Mr. Trump for calling for the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and for saying that more allies should acquire nuclear weapons so that the U.S. doesn't have to shoulder so much of the cost.
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are competing hard in the June 7 primary in California. At stake are 475 delegates, the most of the 57 Democratic contests.
With Mr. Brown enjoying a high approval rating in the nation's largest state, his endorsement has the potential to make a difference.

Clinton Might Not Be the Nominee,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792700554?accountid=12768,"Correction
Data from mid-May show that in California 1.5 million voters have newly registered since Jan. 1. The June 1 op-ed ""Clinton Might Not Be the Nominee"" mischaracterized the voters' party affiliation.
(WSJ June 3, 2016)
There is now more than a theoretical chance that Hillary Clinton may not be the Democratic nominee for president.
How could that happen, given that her nomination has been considered a sure thing by virtually everyone in the media and in the party itself? Consider the possibilities.
The inevitability behind Mrs. Clinton's nomination will be in large measure eviscerated if she loses the June 7 California primary to Bernie Sanders. That could well happen.
A recent PPIC poll shows Mrs. Clinton with a 2% lead over Mr. Sanders, and a Fox News survey found the same result. Even a narrow win would give him 250 pledged delegates or more -- a significant boost. California is clearly trending to Mr. Sanders, and the experience in recent open primaries has been that the Vermont senator tends to underperform in pre-election surveys and over-perform on primary and caucus days, thanks to the participation of new registrants and young voters.
To this end, data from mid-May show that there were nearly 1.5 million newly registered Democratic voters in California since Jan. 1. That's a 218% increase in Democratic voter registrations compared with the same period in 2012, a strongly encouraging sign for Mr. Sanders.
A Sanders win in California would powerfully underscore Mrs. Clinton's weakness as a candidate in the general election. Democratic superdelegates -- chosen by the party establishment and overwhelmingly backing Mrs. Clinton, 543-44 -- would seriously question whether they should continue to stand behind her candidacy.
There is every reason to believe that at the convention Mr. Sanders will offer a rules change requiring superdelegates to vote for the candidate who won their state's primary or caucus. A vote on that proposed change would almost certainly occur -- and it would function as a referendum on the Clinton candidacy. If Mr. Sanders wins California, Montana and North Dakota on Tuesday and stays competitive in New Jersey, he could well be within 200 pledged delegates of Mrs. Clinton, making a vote in favor of the rules change on superdelegates more likely.
Another problem: In recent weeks the perception that Mrs. Clinton would be the strongest candidate against Donald Trump has evaporated. The Real Clear Politics polling average has Mrs. Clinton in a statistical tie with Mr. Trump, and recent surveys from ABC News/Washington Post and Fox News show her two and three points behind him, respectively.
Then there is that other crack in the argument for Mrs. Clinton's inevitability: Bernie Sanders consistently runs stronger than she does against Mr. Trump nationally, beating him by about 10 points in a number of recent surveys.
The worries about Mr. Sanders's strength have stirred the beginnings of a capitulation to him -- by the Clinton camp, in league with the Democratic National Committee -- at the convention. To placate him, they have already granted Mr. Sanders greater influence over the party platform. Two divisive figures, Cornel West and Rep. Keith Ellison, have been added to the platform committee, ensuring that the party will be pulled further left. In addition to putting Mr. Sanders's socialist nostrums on display, the platform negotiations are likely to spur an ugly fight over the U.S. relationship with Israel.
Mrs. Clinton also faces growing legal problems. The State Department inspector general's recent report on Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state made it abundantly clear that she broke rules and has been far from forthright in her public statements. The damning findings buttressed concerns within the party that Mrs. Clinton and her aides may not get through the government's investigation without a finding of culpability somewhere.
With Mrs. Clinton reportedly soon to be interviewed by the FBI, suggesting that the investigation is winding up, a definitive ruling by the attorney general could be issued before the July 25 Democratic convention in Philadelphia. Given the inspector general's report, a clean bill of health from the Justice Department is unlikely.
Finally, with Mrs. Clinton's negative rating nearly as high as Donald Trump's, and with voters not trusting her by a ratio of 4 to 1, Democrats face an unnerving possibility. Only a month or two ago, they were relishing the prospect of a chaotic Republican convention, with a floor fight and antiestablishment rebellion in the air. Now the messy, disastrous convention could be their own.
There are increasing rumblings within the party about how a new candidate could emerge at the convention. John Kerry, the 2004 nominee, is one possibility. But the most likely scenario is that Vice President Joe Biden -- who has said that he regrets ""every day"" his decision not to run -- enters the race.
Mr. Biden would be cast as the white knight rescuing the party, and the nation, from a possible Trump presidency. To win over Sanders supporters, he would likely choose as his running mate someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren who is respected by the party's left wing.
Where is President Obama in all this? So far he has largely stayed out of the campaign, other than to say that he doesn't believe Mrs. Clinton compromised national security with her home-brew email server. But with her poll numbers dropping, her legal headaches increasing, the Sanders candidacy showing renewed vigor, and Donald Trump looming as a wrecking ball for the president's legacy, Mr. Obama and adviser Valerie Jarrett might begin sending signals to the Democratic National Committee and to the vice president that a Biden rescue operation wouldn't displease the White House.
All of these remain merely possibilities. But it is easier now than ever to imagine a scenario in which Hillary Clinton -- whether by dint of legal or political circumstances -- is not the Democratic presidential nominee.

"Donald Trump Expresses Regret for Past Comments; At campaign event in Charlotte, candidate nods to his tendency to say controversial things, then goes on to attack Hillary Clinton and the media",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812349928?accountid=12768,"CHARLOTTE, N.C.--Donald Trump, bolstered by an overhauled campaign staff brought on to turn the page of his troubled candidacy, tried something totally new Thursday night: He expressed regret.
""As you know, I'm not a politician,"" he said at a campaign event here. ""Sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and, believe it or not, I regret it.
""And I do regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain.""
Mr. Trump didn't indicate which of his many provocative comments he regrets. One of his most recent and protracted controversies arose from his
criticism of a family of a Muslim U.S. soldier who died in Iraq.
After the brief nod to one of the marquee features of his campaign--his penchant to go off-script and say controversial things--he went on to attack his Democratic rival and the media in his usual, emphatic fashion.
He called on Hillary Clinton to apologize for what he sees as her mistakes in handling emails and policy while secretary of state.
""The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them,"" he said. ""Has she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?""
In another departure from his signature, boisterous rallies, Mr. Trump for the fourth time in less than two weeks spoke from a prepared text and read from a teleprompter. He drew on elements of his last three speeches--one last week on economic policy, one on terrorism, and a speech Tuesday in Wisconsin on law enforcement that included a new pitch to African-American voters.
In another moment of seriousness, he opened the speech by expressing condolences for the people of Baton Rouge, who have been hit by devastating floods . That stood in contrast to his controversial response to another tragedy--the massacre in an Orlando nightclub , which he responded to with partisan comments and a Twitter message that seemed to be bragging that he had predicted that acts of terrorism would occur.
Mr. Trump, in a departure from his planned campaign schedule, is expected to fly to Baton Rouge on Friday to tour the city with his running mate, Mike Pence.
The speech, in a cavernous hall at the Charlotte Convention Center, came two days after Mr. Trump overhauled his campaign staff and installed as chief executive Stephen Bannon, a conservative media executive who some Republicans believed would reinforce Mr. Trump's penchant for combativeness. Mr. Trump also promoted pollster Kellyanne Conway to be campaign manager.
Confounding expectations after Mr. Bannon's hiring, Mr. Trump in Charlotte struck a controlled posture and remained strictly on the message his Republican colleagues have been urging him to deploy--attacking Mrs. Clinton.
It is not clear how long this low-key approach will last for a candidate who has said he doesn't want to ""pivot"" to a more presidential persona, or whether it will cost him support among the voters who found his more boisterous approach appealing. But some in the audience in Charlotte appreciated the change of demeanor.
Kevin Higgins, 38, a small-business man from Charlotte, said he welcomed the shift of tone from what he saw as a more ""arrogant"" stance in the past. Now that Mr. Trump is down in the polls, Mr. Higgins said, ""It seems he's a little worried.""

"Law and Order: Trump Unit; For global and domestic disorder, Trump's answer looks better than Clinton's answer.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811951828?accountid=12768,"Richard Nixon, law and order's most famous practitioner, used the reality of domestic unrest to defeat Hubert Humphrey in the annus horribilis, 1968. President George W. Bush persuaded voters in 2004 that John Kerry would provide uncertain leadership in the post-9/11 war on terror.
Donald Trump, always willing to test the limits of any thought, is campaigning for law and order on a global scale. He's accusing Hillary Clinton of being soft on crime at home and soft on terror everywhere in the world. It's ""Law and Order: Global Victims Unit,"" Donald J. Trump producer.
Tuesday in Milwaukee, which last weekend looked a lot like Baltimore's 2015 street riots, Mr. Trump said: ""The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most. There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members and felons to prey on innocent people. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe.""
In Monday's foreign policy speech he pledged to do a reverse-Obama by keeping Gitmo open and trying accused terrorists in military tribunals. Likening his strategy to ""the effort to take down the mafia,"" he said ""this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country.""
With most of the battleground states looking more like Republican burial grounds, it may be pressing the membrane of believability to say the Trump law-and-order strategy just might work. That said, Mr. Trump's naming this week of the adept Republican political strategist Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager means he may yet give his supporters a competitive presidential campaign.
Democrats deserve to have a Trumpian version of ""law and order"" unloaded on them. I don't think the Democrats are soft on crime and terrorism. They're just ambivalent. Ambivalence can get you killed, especially around people with guns and bombs.
Asked after every primary to rank four issues, Democrats nearly always put terrorism fourth. It hardly came up in the Clinton-Sanders debates.
And whether the domestic shooters are San Bernardino's terrorists, Orlando's nut or Chicago's gangs, the Democrats' offer the same silver bullet: gun control.
The problem with how they've teed up the cops has been the nonexistence of any Democratic alternative beyond patrolling the toughest streets with a blue version of Casper the Friendly Ghost.
On national security, an example of progressive foreign policy's half-in, half-out attitude was former Attorney General Eric Holder's remark in May that the traitorous Edward Snowden ""actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made."" No, it was not worth anything.
In a Journal article last month, an administration official summarized the Obama anti-terror policy. It reads like aggression with footnotes:
""Not just in Afghanistan, but in Iraq and Syria, it's very evident what his approach is, which is to make sure we're doing everything necessary to disrupt and ultimately defeat terrorist networks while significantly reducing the role of the U.S. military in terms of the ground presence and also reducing the resources associated with that presence.""
There is a specific, well-known reason for a Democratic policy of ""reducing the resources associated with that presence,"" one that 50 former Bush officials should have thought about before unfurling their Hamlet-like statement last week on the election and national security.
The reason is guns versus butter, military spending versus always unsated domestic needs. The liberals' battle for butter began in the 1960s, when they vilified Lyndon Johnson for spending on Vietnam and the Cold War rather than the Great Society.
Right now, foreign-policy liberals and some conservatives are pushing sotto voce assurances that Hillary will ""get it right"" on national security. They had better go line-by-line through the economic-policy speech she gave last week in Michigan. After the greatest outlay on infrastructure spending ""since World War II,"" tuition-free college for the middle class and ""debt-free for everyone,"" plus uncountable tax credits, anything Mrs. Clinton gets right will be on the cheap. Like her ""intelligence surge.""
This isn't Bill Clinton's center-left Democratic Party. It's the left-only party of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama. What they want is butter, lakes of it. Anti-terrorism gets to tread water, alongside the cops.
Defeating Islamic terror is a rare unifying issue for conservatives and indeed for the world. Unlike any conceivable Democratic president, Donald Trump is at least willing to lead this battle, reflecting the truth that it won't happen without active, unrelenting U.S. leadership.
No doubt this is yet another issue with which voters have to struggle, wanting an alternative to the Obama-Clinton Democrats but burdened with misgivings that are of Mr. Trump's own creation.
But Donald Trump didn't create the law-and-order issue. Cities and nations under assault did that. Just now, his answer for both looks better than her answer.

Clinton Makes History With Win,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794399292?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- Hillary Clinton declared victory Tuesday night in the Democratic presidential primary race, emerging from a bruising battle as the first woman within striking distance of the Oval Office.
Her rise came exactly eight years after she ended her 2008 bid by saying primary voters had, with their votes, put 18 million cracks in the ""highest, hardest"" glass ceiling that prevented women from winning the presidency.
""Tonight's victory is not about one person,"" she told a crowd of supporters in Brooklyn who chanted ""Madame President!"" before she took the stage. ""It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible.""
President Barack Obama called both Mrs. Clinton and rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to thank them for running ""inspiring campaigns,"" according to White House press secretary Josh Earnest.
""Her historic campaign inspired millions,"" Mr. Obama said about Mrs. Clinton. The president thanked Mr. Sanders for ""energizing millions of Americans."" Messrs. Obama and Sanders will meet at the White House Thursday, at Mr. Sanders's request. The president is expected to endorse Mrs. Clinton as soon as this week.
Mr. Sanders aimed to throw up one last roadblock by winning the California Democratic primary on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton's victory, however, was cemented with wins in New Jersey and New Mexico before the polls closed in California. She also won in South Dakota.
Mrs. Clinton used her remarks to reach out to supporters of Mr. Sanders, who won the North Dakota caucuses Tuesday night. She said their debate had been good for the party and asked them to ""remember all that unites us.""
She also turned attention to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying he was ""temperamentally unfit"" to hold the nation's highest office, and charging him with wanting to take America backward.
Earlier in the night, Mr. Trump, who won all five GOP contests Tuesday, promised to deliver his first major general-election speech next week. He said he would accuse Mrs. Clinton and her husband of using their public positions to enrich themselves.
In setting the stage for an expected brutal general election against Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton said, it wouldn't be ""about the same old fights between Democrats and Republicans. This election is different. It really is about who we are as a nation. It's about millions of Americans coming together to say we are better than this. We won't let this happen.""
Ellen Dubois, a professor of history at the University of California-Los Angeles, said the unique road Mrs. Clinton walked underscored the transformation of women's roles. ""There's been a gradual movement of women into meaningful positions in political parties and elected offices,"" she said. ""Whatever happens in this election, it will not completely clear the path, but it does open the path.""
Women helped propel Mrs. Clinton to victory in the Democratic primary, exit polls taken this primary season in 27 states showed. While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders split men's votes nearly evenly, the polls found the former secretary of state won 61% of women, while the Vermont senator won just 37%.
But Mrs. Clinton still has work to do to shore up potential advantages with women voters as she pivots to the general election. A May Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that she leads among women by 13 percentage points; among women with college educations she's ahead by 24 percentage points. But Mr. Trump leads among white women with less than a college education by 11 percentage points -- more than his 9-point advantage among men.
For his part, Mr. Trump appears determined to confront the gender issue head-on. ""I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry, and my relationship, I think, is going to end up being very good with women,"" he told Fox News.
Although Mrs. Clinton was long viewed as the inevitable Democratic nominee, the road during this primary season was much rockier than anticipated, with Mr. Sanders posing an unexpectedly persistent and formidable threat.
The self-described democratic socialist from Vermont won more than 20 contests along the way and -- until this week -- denied her the pledged delegates needed to become the party's standard-bearer.
Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator, maintained a lead among superdelegates, party leaders who can back whomever they want, and that gave her an advantage throughout the race. They put her over the 2,383 delegate threshold on Monday, prompting the Associated Press to declare her the presumptive nominee.
Mr. Sanders has long objected to the influence of superdelegates, who will officially cast their votes at the July convention in Philadelphia, and he has vowed to try to take some from Mrs. Clinton. It is unclear whether he will continue to woo them.
From the start, Mrs. Clinton embraced the historic nature of her candidacy, a sharp contrast to 2008, when advisers concluded her priority should be to project toughness and assure voters she was prepared to be commander in chief. With four years as secretary of state on her resume, advisers saw her gender in this campaign as a selling point for older women, who came of age at a time when women had fewer opportunities.
On the campaign trail, she has talked frequently about women and children's issues, including equal pay for women. She reminded voters she was a new grandmother. In the campaign's online store, T-shirts made to look like her signature pantsuits were for sale, along with a pillow with the words,""A woman's place is in the White House.""
When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused her of ""playing the gender card,"" the campaign decided to highlight his words. Mrs. Clinton would recount the charge at rallies, adding that if sticking up for women's rights was playing the gender card, then ""deal me in!""
The Clinton campaign released a video featuring words and images of American women who have made history, including feminist Gloria Steinem and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
At the polls Tuesday, some voters said they were motivated by the chance to cast a historic vote -- and they weren't all women. Andrew Rind, a 56-year-old Montclair, N.J., resident, said he voted for Mrs. Clinton. ""I'm kind of tired of the prototype of the privileged, white male president.""

Election 2016 -- Analysis: Insider Clinton Runs in Year of Outsiders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794399274?accountid=12768,"When Hillary Clinton first burst onto the national political scene, Barack Obama was a rookie law lecturer, Bernie Sanders was an obscure back-bencher in the House of Representatives and Donald Trump was an over-extended developer trying to keep unhappy banks and bondholders at bay.
It has been a long, quarter-century's journey from those early days -- when she famously declared that she was more than a Tammy Wynette knockoff standing by her man, Bill Clinton -- to Tuesday night, when she celebrated becoming the first woman to accumulate the delegates needed to secure a presidential nomination. It's an achievement that would have been impossible half a century ago, was unlikely two decades ago, and proved just beyond reach eight years ago.
By now, of course, it's almost a cliche to say that Hillary Clinton has been preparing her whole life for this moment, but in many ways that is true. The question now is whether she has arrived at the right time -- or, if not, whether she can adjust to the times at which she has arrived.
Put differently, can Mrs. Clinton now convince the country that a profile that has made her life difficult for much of this year -- establishment figure, experienced in the ways of Washington, serious to the point of severity -- work in her favor in the next five months? Will running against Donald Trump, a fellow baby boomer with essentially the opposite profile, make that task easier for her, or harder?
The questions arise because, just beyond the history-making character of her candidacy, and the early fights she had to wage to earn her own spot on stage, Mrs. Clinton has taken on the look of a thoroughly conventional politician who has checked all the boxes needed to create a strong presidential-campaign resume:
Ivy League education? Check. Experience in the Senate? Check. Experience in the cabinet? Check. Foreign-policy experience? Check. A raft of mainstream policy experts? Check. Book about your government record and philosophy? Check. Top-tier list of donors? Check.
There was a time, and not so long ago, when such a resume would have been enough to ward off pesky unconventional challengers and guarantee a respectable reception, at least within one's own party. But 2016 isn't such a time, and Mrs. Clinton has had to face the reality that such a resume, for at least some voters, isn't an asset to be burnished but a problem to be overcome.
""I honestly believe that we are in one of the most populist eras in modern American history,"" says Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic Party official and Clinton supporter who now is executive director of the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University. ""The old left-right paradigm is gone, and it doesn't exist outside of the"" New York-Washington axis.
He adds: ""Left and right has been replaced by up and down."" Voters across the land believe that ""the people above me are getting all the breaks, the people below me are getting all the handouts. Who in the hell is going to look out for me?""
What voters in 2016 are looking for, Mr. Elleithee says, is ""a champion"" for them.
Sen. Bernie Sanders found that the things he had been saying to no great effect for years -- Wall Street greed is ruining the economy, rich people need to pay more to help everybody else -- made him into such a champion figure. Mr. Trump, despite his billions and his lavish lifestyle, found that attacking foreign trade deals and illegal immigrants has made him such a champion in the eyes of millions.
The 2016 landscape is littered with other conventional politicians who couldn't pull that off: Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie and so on.
Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has survived, which alone is saying something this year. She's suffered damage along the way, though. Many voters say they don't find her honest and trustworthy, a problem exacerbated by the nagging questions over her decision to use her own email system while secretary of state. There's an inescapable whiff of Clinton fatigue.
Yet her biggest problem in the general isn't likely to be winning over Bernie Sanders, or wooing Sanders voters, or making an ideological shift to the center, or finding the right tone for attacking Donald Trump. Odds are that she will find a way to do all those things.
Her problem is going to be finding a way to connect with skeptical middle Americans in revolt against the political establishment, and convince them that she can be the economic champion they seek. Mr. Elleithee says he has seen flashes of that Hillary Clinton in the primary season -- but also warns she won't be able to make that case if she allows the campaign to be an extended national conversation about Mr. Trump.

Election 2016: Early Clinton Call Was a Surprise,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794311419?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- The decision by media outlets on Monday night to declare Hillary Clinton the winner of the Democratic nomination on the eve of the last major primaries caught both Democratic candidates off guard and led Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign to call the projection premature.
Just hours before voters in six states would head to the polls, the Associated Press on Monday night declared Mrs. Clinton the winner, citing a flurry of late commitments to her from Democratic superdelegates. Its call was confirmed by several television networks, designating Mrs. Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee.
The Associated Press report came as a surprise. Mrs. Clinton, who leads in both the popular vote and delegate count, had been expected to win enough delegates to claim the nomination on Tuesday, after Democratic voters in six states cast ballots.
Both campaigns were eager to play down the designation of a victor. For Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton's apparent win undercut his rationale for continuing his campaign to the Democratic convention. Mrs. Clinton's campaign treaded lightly, fearing her supporters wouldn't turn out for Tuesday's elections.
Though Mrs. Clinton could win the nomination without victories in those primaries, a loss to Mr. Sanders in New Jersey or in a big, diverse state such as California would have ended her primary campaign on a sign of weakness.
""It's a really big deal for California to vote, because California is about the future,"" Mrs. Clinton said on Monday in urging supporters to go to the polls, after the Associated Press designated her the presumed nominee.
Mr. Sanders's campaign portrayed the AP designation as incorrect and premature, arguing that the media calculations relied on reports of the preferences of superdelegates, who won't vote until the party convention in July.
The Sanders campaign said Tuesday that Mr. Sanders wouldn't leave the race after the day's elections. AfterTuesday, only the District of Columbia'sJune 14primary remains.
""What I was upset [by] is what the AP did,"" Mr. Sanders told NBC on Tuesday. ""They got on the phone, as I understand it, and they started hounding superdelegates to tell them in an anonymous way who they'd be voting for. And the night before the largest primary, biggest primary in the whole process, they make this announcement.""
The Associated Press decision to call the race was based on interviews with superdelegates, a longstanding practice at the outlet. Mrs. Clinton was about two dozen delegates short of clinching the nomination afterSaturday'sprimary in Puerto Rico.
On Monday, Associated Press reporting turned up enough commitments from previously unpledged superdelegates to declare Mrs. Clinton the likely winner.
The organization has conducted delegate surveys during presidential election cycles going back decades, said executive editor Kathleen Carroll. The process entails reporters in the news services' bureaus aroundthe country talking to superdelegates from both parties on a regular basis and asking them whom they plan to support at the convention.
""We've been talking with them since last year,"" she said.
When a superdelegate says he or she unequivocally supports a particular candidate, that person is added to the AP's overall delegate vote count, a tally that is updated regularly throughout the primaries.
Ms. Carroll said it was a coincidence that the combined count of pledged delegates and confirmed superdelegates backing Mrs. Clinton crossed the 2,383 mark lateon Monday,just a day before the last set of primaries was to be held. It takes 2,383 delegates, a majority of the total, to claim the nomination.
What pushed Mrs. Clinton over the top was combination of additional superdelegates pledging their support on Monday and the final results from Puerto Rico's primary, which Mrs. Clinton won decisively.
""We reported this when we did because that was when the threshold was crossed,"" Ms. Carroll said. ""There was no way we could have reached that point and have waited to report it. That's not how news organizations operate.""

Trump vs. Clinton on Gun Rights,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793166382?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is famous for his flights of political exaggeration, but every so often he lands on the truth. Witness his claim to the National Rifle Association on Friday that ""the Second Amendment is on the ballot in November"" and that Hillary Clinton ""wants to abolish the Second Amendment.""
This has offended Mrs. Clinton's media bodyguards who claim she merely favors background checks and minor regulation. Mrs. Clinton took to Twitter to claim that Mr. Trump is ""wrong,"" and ""We can uphold Second Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence.""
Let's go to the audiotape. If Mrs. Clinton ""gets to appoint her judges, she will as part of it abolish the Second Amendment,"" Mr. Trump told the NRA. He added that Mrs. Clinton had rebuked the Supreme Court for its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller establishing that the Second Amendment included an individual right to bear arms.
At a private fundraiser last year Mrs. Clinton did criticize the Supreme Court for being ""wrong on the Second Amendment."" One of her policy advisers, Maya Harris, tried to muddy that position this weekend by telling Bloomberg Politics that Mrs. Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.""
But that is a fudge. Heller explicitly allowed that the ""right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited."" Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion did not sort through every possible regulation, but it did say that the individual right covers guns that are ""in common use for lawful purposes."" And it overturned the District of Columbia's handgun ban. By implication Heller would also disallow the Clinton Administration's ban on semi-automatic rifles used for hunting. That ban has since expired, though Mrs. Clinton supports reinstating it.
The question Mrs. Clinton is ducking is whether she agrees with Heller's ruling that individuals can bear arms. The political left has long held that such a right under the Second Amendment belongs only to a ""well regulated Militia.""
This distinction matters because Mrs. Clinton knows that four liberal Justices dissented from Heller on precisely this point about an individual right. And apparently they still do. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the dissenters, told a luncheon of the Harvard Club in 2009 that their dissent was crafted with an eye to helping a ""future, wiser court"" overturn Heller.
Sonia Sotomayor replaced David Souter in 2009, but she joined the liberal bloc on guns. The Supreme Court has over the years applied the Bill of Rights to the states as relevant cases presented themselves. Once Heller established an individual right to bear arms, every Court precedent called for applying it to the states in McDonald v. Chicago in 2010. The vote should have been 9-0. Yet the four liberals still dissented in McDonald -- confirming Justice Ginsburg's Harvard boast that they are waiting to overturn Heller.
Justice Elena Kagan (who replaced John Paul Stevens) hasn't had a chance to rule on the individual right to bear arms, but don't expect her to be different. If Mrs. Clinton selects Antonin Scalia's replacement, she knows the Court's liberals will get their opportunity to overturn Heller. The Second Amendment really is on the ballot this November.

"In Clinton vs. Trump, the Overlooked Impact of Asian-Americans; Republican nominee tries to court blacks and Hispanics, but another group that leans Democratic gets less attention",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812981629?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has made overtures in the last few days to Hispanic and African-American voters, trying to whittle away the giant advantages Hillary Clinton enjoys among them.
There is a third group that gets less attention, but one that provides Democrats a similar strategic edge: Asian-Americans.
Asian-Americans are the nation's fastest-growing racial group. More than nine million of them will be eligible to vote in November, up 16% from four years ago.
The bad news for Republicans is that this growth in the Asian-American electorate appears to be accompanied by an increasing tilt toward the Democrats. One national poll of Asian-American voters earlier this year found a 12-point increase in those who identify as Democrats since 2012, to 47% from 35%.
Can that matter? Ask Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. He won re-election two years ago by the narrowest of margins, defeating Republican Ed Gillespie by fewer than 18,000 votes out of 2.18 million cast. Virginia's large population of Asian-Americans likely provided the difference. They make up 5% of the state's electorate, and a pre-election poll showed them going for Mr. Warner by a 2-to-1 margin.
For Mr. Trump and his party, Asian-Americans are another example of how his get-tough stance on immigration represents a two-edged sword. It has helped galvanize support and drive up enthusiasm among working-class whites, many of whom think immigration has damaged them economically and undermined the American culture they have known. Meanwhile, on the sliding scale of the diverse American electorate, votes gained there are offset by votes lost to groups who hear chants of ""build that wall"" as an ominous sign.
Mr. Trump and his supporters insist that his policies are directed not at immigration generally but at illegal immigration specifically, but they have had a hard time getting that message across. Over the weekend, his campaign appeared to begin softening its tone; his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Mr. Trump wouldn't necessarily stick with his pledge to seek deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants.
Still, the hole he and his party faces appears to be deep, including with Asian-American voters.
A survey earlier this year by the Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote project, a nonpartisan organization that works to mobilize voters of Asian heritage, found that 61% of Asian-American registered voters held an unfavorable view of Mr. Trump, while a nearly identical share held a favorable view of Mrs. Clinton. The same survey found that 40% said they would vote against a candidate who expressed ""strongly anti-immigrant views,"" even if they agreed with that candidate on other issues.
Such readings frustrate Republicans who think Asian-Americans ought to have a more natural affinity with the GOP. While Asian-Americans are hardly monolithic--they include those with roots in the Philippines, Korea, China and Vietnam as well in the Asian subcontinent countries of India and Pakistan--many have a wide entrepreneurial streak that would seem in sync with Republican policies.
Surveys suggest they aren't strongly rooted in either party, and aren't especially liberal. The APIAVote survey showed 23% called themselves liberal, 19% conservative and a whopping 48% moderate.
But many of these Asian-Americans also are making their marks in the high-tech world, where Mr. Trump's immigration policies are unpopular. Moreover, there are signs that Democratic outreach to Asian-Americans has simply been better than that of the Republicans.
So what difference does all this make, now and in the future? Nationally, the impact of Asian-Americans isn't huge. They make up only about 4% of eligible voters. But in some key battleground states their impact will be significantly larger. In addition to Virginia, Asian-Americans make up 9% of the electorate in Nevada, 7% in New Jersey and 3.1% in Minnesota. In California, they make up almost 15% of the electorate.
Like Hispanics, Asian-Americans' political activism hasn't always matched their numbers, but that may be changing. The number of Asian-Americans running for Congress rose to 40 this year from eight just eight years ago. In one of the nation's most prominent Senate races, Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Asian-American fluent in Thai and Indonesian, is seeking to knock off Republican Sen. Mark Kirk.
Long-term trends mean the impact of Asian-Americans will only rise. Immigration from Asia is rapidly overtaking immigration from Latin America as the largest source of new arrivals. The Pew Research Center says Asians already outnumber Hispanics among immigrants who have arrived in the last five years, partly because of a sharp drop in immigration from Mexico. By 2065, a Pew Research Center study says, Asians will outnumber Hispanics among all immigrants.
That's the real reason Republicans ought to be worried about their standing with Asian-Americans. They are arriving as a full-fledged political force, and 2016 is only the start.

Virginia's large population of Asian-Americans likely provided the difference. They make up 5% of the state's electorate, and a pre-election poll showed them going for Mr. Warner by a 2-to-1 margin.
For Mr. Trump and his party, Asian-Americans are another example of how his get-tough stance on immigration represents a two-edged sword. It has helped galvanize support and drive up enthusiasm among working-class whites, many of whom think immigration has damaged them economically and undermined the American culture they have known.
Meanwhile, on the sliding scale of the diverse American electorate, votes gained there are offset by votes lost to groups who hear chants of ""build that wall"" as an ominous sign.
Mr. Trump and his supporters insist that his policies are directed not at immigration generally but at illegal immigration specifically, but they have had a hard time getting that message across. Over the weekend, his campaign appeared to begin softening its tone; his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Mr. Trump wouldn't necessarily stick with his pledge to seek deportation of 11 million undocumented aliens.
Still, the hole he and his party faces appears to be deep, including with Asian-American voters.
A survey earlier this year by the Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote project, a nonpartisan organization that works to mobilize voters of Asian heritage, found that 61% of Asian-American registered voters held an unfavorable view of Mr. Trump, while a nearly identical share held a favorable view of Mrs. Clinton. The same survey found that 40% said they would vote against a candidate who expressed ""strongly anti-immigrant views,"" even if they agreed with that candidate on other issues.
Such readings frustrate Republicans who think Asian-Americans ought to have a more natural affinity with the GOP. While Asian-Americans are hardly monolithic--they include those with roots in the Philippines, Korea, China and Vietnam as well in the Asian subcontinent countries of India and Pakistan--many have a wide entrepreneurial streak that would seem in sync with Republican policies.
Surveys suggest they aren't strongly rooted in either party, and aren't especially liberal. The APIAVote survey showed 23% called themselves liberal, 19% conservative and a whopping 48% moderate.
But many of these Asian-Americans also are making their marks in the high-tech world, where Mr. Trump's immigration policies are unpopular. Moreover, there are signs that Democratic outreach to Asian-Americans has simply been better than that of the Republicans.
So what difference does all this make, now and in the future? Nationally, the impact of Asian-Americans isn't huge. They make up only about 4% of eligible voters.
But in some key battleground states their impact will be significantly larger than that. In addition to Virginia, Asian-Americans make up 9% of the electorate in Nevada, 7% in New Jersey and 3.1% in Minnesota. In California, they make up almost 15% of the electorate.
Like Hispanics, Asian-Americans' political activism hasn't always matched their numbers, but that may be changing. The number of Asian-Americans running for Congress rose to 40 this year from eight just eight years ago. In one of the nation's most prominent Senate races, Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Asian-American fluent in Thai and Indonesian, is seeking to knock off Republican Sen. Mark Kirk.
Long-term trends mean the impact of Asian-Americans will only rise. Immigration from Asia is rapidly overtaking immigration from Latin America as the largest source of new arrivals. The Pew Research Center says that Asians already outnumber Hispanics among immigrants who have arrived in the last five years, partly because of a sharp drop in immigration from Mexico. By 2065, a Pew study says, Asians will outnumber Hispanics among all immigrants.
That's the real reason Republicans ought to be worried about their standing with Asian-Americans. They are arriving as a full-fledged political force, and 2016 is only the start.

Election 2016: Clinton Hoping for a Surge in Support --- Polling will signal whether win prompts reluctant Democrats to come on board,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794728077?accountid=12768,"Tuesday's primaries secured Hillary Clinton's status as the Democratic Party's presumed nominee for president. But it is still unclear whether that will prompt reluctant Democrats to support her or help improve her public image.
Recent polls showed Republicans closing ranks behind Donald Trump after he won his party's primaries. The coming days will show whether Mrs. Clinton will benefit from a similar rallying effect.
The race has tightened in many surveys, with Mrs. Clinton's lead over Mr. Trump shrinking from 11 percentage points in April to two points in the Real Clear Politics average of national polls. But it is hard to tell whether that is the true starting point for the general election without knowing whether Mrs. Clinton will gain a bounce from the end of the Democratic primary season and whether Mr. Trump's recently improved numbers are durable.
One reason for the tightening poll numbers: Nearly 20% of Sen. Bernie Sanders's backers said in the last Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, in mid-May, that they wouldn't back Mrs. Clinton in a general election against Mr. Trump. If even half of those voters swung behind Mrs. Clinton, they would substantially restore her lead.
Mrs. Clinton, who captured the biggest prize of Tuesday's primary contests with a victory in California, may have some persuading to do. More than half of the Sanders-but-not-Clinton voters are under age 40, a group that resisted her in the primaries.About a third are independents, suggesting they may want to keep some distance from her party.
Here are some questions to consider as new polls arrive:
How big could the rally be?
After Mr. Trump's GOP rivals abandoned the primary race, the share of Republicans who said they would back him against Mrs. Clinton jumped in Journal/NBC polling to 86% in May from 72% in April.
Mrs. Clinton had the support of 83% of Democrats in May's Journal/NBC survey, a slight decline from April and well behind the level of support she likely will need in November.
The good news for her is that members of each party are likely to return to their corners come Election Day. In 2012, 93% of Republicans backed GOP nominee Mitt Romney, while 92% of Democrats backed President Barack Obama. A similar showing would work to Mrs. Clinton's advantage, because there are more Democratic than Republican voters.
Will she improve her standing with white voters?
Polling consistently shows minority voters view Mr. Trump in a negative light. But his strength among white voters could offset that weakness. Given that whites account for nearly 70% of the electorate, Mrs. Clinton would be in trouble if Mr. Trump builds too big a margin among them.
In May's Journal/NBC poll, Mr. Trump led by 16 points among white voters, up from seven points in January. His lead among working-class white men grew substantially from early in the year, into a remarkable 48-point advantage over Mrs. Clinton. And he significantly narrowed his deficit against Mrs. Clinton among white women with college degrees.
Will Mr. Trump retain his image as a good steward of the economy?
Voters trust him more than Mrs. Clinton to handle the economy, especially voters struggling most. But instead of focusing on last week's weak report showing employers added only 38,000 jobs in May, he created a controversy by questioning whether a federal judge could be impartial to him in a civil suit because of the judge's Mexican heritage.
That revived questions about his temperament and risked reversing the recent improvement in his public image as shown by polls.
Can President Obama help Mrs. Clinton?
Mr. Obama's job-approval rating is at its highest since early 2013, about the time of his inauguration to a second term. That improves his ability to campaign for Mrs. Clinton, a role he is expected to take on energetically, motivating African-American voters and others in the Democratic base who have stood by him throughout his presidency.
But Mr. Obama's improving numbers have come when he has been overshadowed by the presidential campaign. Once he returns to the rough and tumble of the political brawl, a drop in his approval could make him a less successful advocate among voters more loosely attached to the party or the political process.

"Clinton Grooves a Pitch, Trump Whiffs",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794723670?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have pivoted to the general election -- and their attacks on each other so far suggest that the next 152 days will be ugly.
Start with Mrs. Clinton. Last week in San Diego she gave what was billed as a major speech on foreign affairs. Yet in about 4,000 words she devoted only 714 to defending her record as secretary of state and 961 to articulating future policies. She spent 2,115 words -- 51% -- bashing Mr. Trump.
Mrs. Clinton lacerated him for holding ""dangerously incoherent"" ideas and described him as ""temperamentally unfit"" for the presidency, ""not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes."" Her speech was focused, well constructed and (for her) adequately delivered. But in this era of social networks, voters collect information in diffuse ways; it will take more than one speech to firmly plant these impressions with voters.
In turn, Mr. Trump must answer attacks more effectively. His response was surprisingly weak for someone who prides himself on being a counterpuncher. Mrs. Clinton's speech provided a treasure trove of subjects for him to punch back on: He could have attacked her for failing to reset U.S.-Russia relations, to end North Korea's nuclear program, to stop Libya from descending into chaos after Moammar Gadhafi's removal, or to keep ISIS from establishing a Middle East caliphate.
Mr. Trump could have criticized her for backing the Iranian nuclear deal. He could have undermined her claim that she fought for ""better services for our veterans"" by quoting her statement last year that problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs weren't ""as widespread as it has been made out to be.""
He could have offered voters a simple choice: If you like America's standing in the world today and believe in the Obama administration's foreign policy, vote for Hillary; if not, vote for Trump.
Instead, Mr. Trump raged that her ""pathetic"" speech ""had nothing to do with foreign policy."" He then offered the press his chin. In her speech, Mrs. Clinton said that he would encourage Japan to acquire nuclear weapons. This, Mr. Trump, replied, was a lie. But in an April 3 interview on Fox News Sunday, he said that Japan might be better off defending itself, ""including with nukes.""
Mr. Trump also attacked Mrs. Clinton for voting in favor of the Iraq war, boasting, ""I'm the one who didn't want to go in Iraq."" The record shows otherwise. After supporting the Iraq war before its 2003 start, Mr. Trump publicly opposed it only in the late summer of 2004.
These missed opportunities suggest that Mr. Trump doesn't have advisers who look at Mrs. Clinton's utterances and suggest ways to go after her -- or who track his utterances and tell him to stop contradicting himself. His campaign badly needs discipline, a plan of attack, loads of research and robust rapid-response capability.
In the months ahead, Mrs. Clinton will say that she is experienced and qualified, while Mr. Trump is risky, dangerous and repulsive. He will say that he represents the change voters crave, while she would be a third term for President Obama. They can't make these points only once or even episodically: Winning presidential candidates methodically and relentlessly prosecute their campaign's narrative, freshening and extending it every week.
Both may find it difficult to mitigate their weaknesses. Mrs. Clinton must demonstrate that she understands and has something to say about the angst of voters who are concerned the country is rapidly going in the wrong direction. Mr. Trump must reassure Americans that he will bring change responsibly and safely, and will surround himself with qualified, experienced advisers.
The candidates' speeches Tuesday showed they understand there's work to do. Mrs. Clinton's emphasized national unity, saying that America can move forward only if all its people prosper. Mr. Trump was modest and humble, inviting like-minded Americans to join his movement.
This was welcome after a perfectly awful stretch in which the Republican obsessed about a ""Mexican"" judge (who was actually born in Indiana) that he claimed was treating him badly in the case against Trump University. (If that's true, protest in court: otherwise shut up.) Mr. Trump's reprehensible talk could have crippled him, and the next time it might. No more playing Lone Ranger: He must recruit truth-tellers and pros to his team.
Mr. Trump has promised to give a major speech about Hillary on Monday, and the quality of his attack will speak volumes. Focusing on Vince Foster's death, Bill Clinton's adultery and a judge's ethnicity won't do it. Substantive attacks on her record, however, could keep the race close going into the conventions.

Election 2016: Democrats Strive for Party Unity --- Pressure builds for Sanders to rally behind presumptive nominee Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794723189?accountid=12768,"A Democratic Party that split over the fiercely contested presidential primary fight took its first steps toward uniting Wednesday, with prominent Bernie Sanders supporters conceding he had lost the race and saying they would rally behind the presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton.
A day after Mrs. Clinton won California and three other states, Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who was the lone U.S. senator to endorse Mr. Sanders, said she has earned the party's nomination.
""Once we have a candidate who has won the majority of the pledged delegates and the majority of the votes, we have a nominee,"" Mr. Merkley said. ""I had hoped the outcome would be that Bernie Sanders would win. In a democracy, one wins and others don't.""
Aides to Mr. Sanders said he would stay in the race at least through June 14, when Washington, D.C., holds the final Democratic primary. Mr. Sanders was scheduled to hold a campaign event in Washington on Thursday and was also to meet privately with President Barack Obama.
Before the voting on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders had said that he would carry the fight all the way to the convention next month in Philadelphia and would try to pry the nomination from Mrs. Clinton by urging her superdelegates to back his candidacy.
A liberal group that had endorsed Mr. Sanders, Democracy for America, said Wednesday that if Mr. Sanders follows through on such plans, it wouldn't go along. With Mrs. Clinton leading by 376 pledged delegates -- the kind elected by voters -- it would be wrong for superdelegates to step in and effectively overturn the popular vote, the group said.
""We believe [Mr. Sanders] has the right to do that, but we do not plan to help him do that,"" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the group, which recruits and promotes liberal candidates for elective office.
Stepping off the sidelines, Mr. Obama is set to endorse Mrs. Clinton as early as Thursday. The pair will later make a joint campaign appearance in a battleground state targeting independent voters, people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Obama seems prepared to play peacemaker and ensure the party is unified in the general election showdown with Republican Donald Trump.
In an interview Wednesday on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" Mr. Obama said: ""It was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary. I thought that Bernie Sanders brought enormous energy and new ideas."" He said his hope is ""that over the next couple of weeks we're able to pull things together.""
The president has spoken to Mr. Sanders at least twice in recent weeks, hoping to gauge what Mr. Sanders might want from the party. The two are scheduled to meet Thursday, and the president is expected to say it is time for Democrats to set aside differences and embark on the larger project of defeating Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.
Even some of Mr. Sanders's advisers aren't entirely sure what he'll do next. He left California and was scheduled to spend the night at his home in Burlington, Vt., on Wednesday.
It was unclear whether Mr. Sanders intended to carry out his plan to peel away Mrs. Clinton's superdelegates, or if the four defeats he suffered had caused him to rethink his options.
""What he said before June 7th may not be the case after June 7th,"" said Sanders pollster Ben Tulchin. ""The reality is he's going back to Vermont. And he has to absorb it and take it in. . . . He's got to figure out how he can continue this progressive movement in the most effective and impactful way.""
Behind the political drama is the disappointment surely felt by a candidate who was never expected to get this far. A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders wound up winning 22 states. Both the Clinton campaign and Mr. Sanders's allies have sought not to antagonize him by pressuring him to drop out.
Mrs. Clinton knows firsthand how difficult it is to accept defeat. In her 2008 campaign against Mr. Obama, she stayed in the race until the final contests and then waited four days before giving a speech bowing out.
Although the two have a strained relationship, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Sanders on Tuesday evening, part of a series of overtures the Clinton campaign has been making to Mr. Sanders as the race nears the end.
In an interview, Mrs. Clinton said: ""I called him to really express my appreciation and congratulate him on running a hard-fought and very determined campaign that I thought added a lot to the Democratic Party and to our debate in the country.""

Clinton Swipes at Trump on Economy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794723184?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- With the Democratic primary behind her, Hillary Clinton said she now plans to put Republican Donald Trump's business record and economic agenda at the center of her campaign, calling his ideas ""deeply misguided"" and ""dangerously incoherent.""
In an interview Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said she would deliver an economic speech soon contrasting Mr. Trump's record and policies with her own. It will be modeled after a foreign-policy speech she gave last week where she used sometimes identical language to offer a biting critique of the presumptive Republican nominee, charging he was unfit to serve as commander-in-chief.
""While he may have some catchy sound bites, his statements on the economy are dangerously incoherent,"" she said in the interview. ""They are deeply misguided, and they reflect an individual who is temperamentally unfit to manage the American economy.""
Mr. Trump is hardly shrinking from the fight. He promised Tuesday night to deliver a ""major speech"" as early as Monday laying out the case for how Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have perfected what he called the ""politics of personal enrichment.""
With the general election in effect now under way, the exchanges left no doubt that the next five months will be particularly bitter and divisive as both candidates strive to patch up divisions within their own parties while asserting the other shouldn't be president.
For her own part, Mrs. Clinton promised in the interview to put forth a middle-class tax-cut plan, which she said would be a critical part of the case she makes to voters. She wouldn't say whether she supports bipartisan efforts to overhaul the corporate tax code by lowering rates and eliminating some tax breaks, but she promised more details in the weeks ahead.
The interview came a day after the former first lady, senator and secretary of state made history as the first woman to claim the nomination of a major political party. She plans to travel to Ohio and Pennsylvania next week, two states where some analysts have predicted that Mr. Trump's brand of economic populism will resonate, particularly with white, working-class men.
Mrs. Clinton said she was also working to unify Democrats. She spoke to rival Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator, on Tuesday evening and said she would continue making the case to his supporters that there is more that unites than divides them.
While Mr. Sanders lost the contest, he succeeded in helping to push Mrs. Clinton to the left on some issues, including her stance on possible changes to the Social Security program, though she was also responding to a changing Democratic Party.
During the long primary campaign, Mr. Sanders repeatedly hit Mrs. Clinton for her ties to Wall Street, including donations from employees of big banks and paid speeches.
Asked if she would consider including people who have worked on Wall Street in her economic team, she said the question was premature but that she was ""not ruling in, not ruling out"" such an appointment.
""I will always look for the best people when and if that opportunity arises, and I think there's a lot of people around the country, not just in one place in our country, with the kind of experience that would be useful,"" she said.
Her economic address will come later this month, an aide said, but the candidate offered an unsparing preview on Wednesday, pointing to Mr. Trump's plan for large tax cuts, threats made to trading partners and his suggestion, later rescinded, that the U.S. might seek to renegotiate the national debt.
""It's not hard to see how a Trump presidency couldactually lead to a serious global economic crisis,"" she said.
A Trump spokeswoman said Mr. Trump, in his speech next week, would respond to ""the many inaccurate statements"" made by Mrs. Clinton.
Polling suggests the Democrat has a tough task on the economy. While she is seen by voters as better able to handle foreign policy, on economic issues, Mr. Trump opens the general election with the edge, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling last month found.
Asked about four economic issues, voters rated Mr. Trump as better equipped to handle three: dealing with Wall Street, trade and the economy overall. Mrs. Clinton drew the stronger marks only on which candidate could best look out for the middle class.
Running for a third-straight Democratic term, Mrs. Clinton regularly says that President Barack Obama doesn't get the credit he deserves for rescuing the economy from the brink of collapse. But economic headwinds remain, and Mr. Trump has aimed his campaign squarely at voters who feel deep anxiety.
""We are going to have fantastic trade deals,"" he said Tuesday evening. ""We're going to start making money and bringing in jobs.""
Mrs. Clinton's style could hardly be more different. Over the course of the primary, she announced 53 different policy proposals totaling 201 pages, an aide said. She would use the tax code to deter short-term investing, encourage companies to share profits with their workers and ease burdens on the middle class through targeted credits.
The open question is whether this raft of ideas is sufficiently blunt for the large chunk of voters who have lost confidence in the political system's ability to improve their lives. Facing an unconventional opponent in an unpredictable year, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that her approach might require deeper explanation. But she suggested the fact that she garnered more primary votes than either Mr. Trump or Mr. Sanders means Americans may be drawn to her wonkier approach.
""I think it's clear we've got a lot of work to do, we're going to have a lot of explaining to do,"" she said. ""But it's important that voters know that, No. 1, I am listening, and I'm also learning about what will work . . . to make the economy stronger.""

The Clinton Restoration,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794722227?accountid=12768,"That was an impressive performance by Hillary Clinton Tuesday, announcing her presumptive presidential nomination as an historic first for womankind and something new and wonderful for American democracy. Watching her arms outstretched like Moses, you could almost forget that she first came to national prominence 25 years ago and is the very soul of the Washington status quo.
The Republican tumult this year has masked that Mrs. Clinton represents the triumph of the Democratic establishment. The party's interest groups coalesced around her, and her most prominent opponents declined to run, leaving only a 74-year-old socialist to contest the nomination. Democratic elites are getting what they want: Another identity-politics candidacy wrapped around a relentless will to power.
---
Yet this attempt to restore the Clinton dynasty is no mere replay of the 1990s. This time America is being offered the familiar Clinton ethics, but without Bill Clinton's bow to center-right policy. This time we are getting the grasping and corner-cutting of the Clinton entourage with economic policies somewhere to the left of President Obama's.
This carries no small political risk. Democrats have had to accept the uncertainty of an FBI investigation into her private emails, about which she has lied repeatedly, and Bill Clinton's fundraising from foreign donors with business before the State Department when she was Secretary. Cheryl Mills, her close aide, said 38 times under oath that she could not ""recall"" answers to email questions, much as Harold Ickes could remember little about his Teamsters mediation in the 1990s.
All of this has produced unfavorable ratings second only to Donald Trump's in modern presidential polling, and even a sizable plurality of Democrats think Mrs. Clinton can't be trusted. Mr. Trump can get away with calling her ""Crooked Hillary"" because voters know the insult captures a fundamental truth.
Even her claim as a political pioneer is half phony because she rose to power as a spouse. Many other women -- Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel -- have succeeded on their own account. A woman will become U.S. President, sooner rather than later, which may be why younger women are less motivated by the ""first woman"" narrative. The question they ask, more wisely than the Baby Boomers, is whether this woman should be President.
What Mrs. Clinton has left behind from the 1990s is her husband's New Democrat politics. The former first lady said on Tuesday that her party had benefitted from a ""vigorous debate"" during this year's primaries, but if there was a debate Bernie Sanders won it.
Mrs. Clinton made the decision to accommodate, rather than rebut, his socialist policy direction. She didn't challenge his premises so much as meet him halfway. Thus she favors higher taxes on capital while her husband cut them. She frowns on charter schools while her husband and even Mr. Obama favor them. She wants to expand Medicare and Social Security while her husband wanted to reform them before impeachment made it impossible.
She favors debt-free college while Bernie wants it all ""free"" on the taxpayer dime. Like Bernie, she wants to phase out all fossil fuels. And like Bernie, but unlike her husband, she now frowns on free trade.
Some wishful Republicans say this is merely campaign positioning, and that Mrs. Clinton will move to the center and govern that way. But more likely is that the Hillary of the primaries is closer to her genuine beliefs. Long before her White House days she was widely known as a woman of the left. She tried to deliver HillaryCare in 1993, only to adopt her husband's centrist stylings after the Republicans took Congress in 1994. Perhaps she would be more pragmatic in dealing with Congress than Mr. Obama has been -- a low bar -- but only if forced by the political mood.
---
The exception may be foreign policy, where her personal instincts have been hard to separate from Mr. Obama's broad strategic retreat. She was along for the ride as Secretary of State on the failed Russian ""reset,"" though she now says Vladimir Putin can't be trusted. She has embraced the Iran nuclear deal, which is consistent with her misguided faith in arms control with adversaries.
On the other hand, Mrs. Clinton seems to believe that American leadership is essential to resisting rogue and authoritarian regimes. She was right to support the rebels in Syria, but she was overruled by Mr. Obama to catastrophic effect in the Middle East, Africa and increasingly Europe. We have some hope that she would come around to support the Pacific trade deal. In this respect she offers a sober alternative to Mr. Trump's frequent rejection of alliances and global engagement.
All of this adds up more or less to a third Obama term, especially on the home front. She is offering more of what hasn't worked on the economy, and a continuing drive left on the identity politics of gender and race. The country wants change she isn't promising, so she will have to run a campaign that seeks to disqualify Mr. Trump as too erratic, divisive and dangerous. He may be the only Republican she could beat, and vice versa.",2016-08-23
"Hillary and Bill Clinton, Inc. No other couple in American politics can offer what the Clintons have to sell.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812973794?accountid=12768,"Many Clinton scandals ago, when Hillary Clinton was trying to explain how she'd parlayed a $1,000 stake in cattle futures into $100,000 in 10 months (by talking to other people and reading The Wall Street Journal) folks were skeptical. How, they asked, could a novice make so much money in so short a time in such a risky market?
Turns out Mrs. Clinton is a better learner than she's given credit for, and the Clinton emails released by Judicial Watch on Monday prove it. The emails were pried out of the system by Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, and they suggest why the Clinton Foundation could be so attractive to the rich and mighty. When a donor had a problem that required the secretary of state's attention, there was Doug Band--a Clinton Foundation exec--emailing Hillary's top staffers at the State Department to ask a favor.
Take a June 23, 2009, email from Doug Band to Huma Abedin. In his email Mr. Band noted that the Crown Prince of Bahrain (a ""good friend of ours"") was asking to see Mrs. Clinton. There are, of course, many ways to be a ""good friend,"" but one sure way would be to contribute between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, as the kingdom of Bahrain had done. Not to mention that the prince had also spent $32 million on a scholarship launched through the Clinton Global Initiative.
Ms. Abedin responded that the prince had sought a meeting through ""normal"" channels but had been shot down. Less than 48 hours after Mr. Band had asked her, Ms. Abedin reported that ""we have reached out through official channels."" The meeting was on.
It isn't the only favor Mr. Band requested. A month earlier, he had emailed Ms. Abedin to ask her help in getting an English soccer player a visa to the U.S. The player was supposed to come to Las Vegas for a team celebration, but he needed a special interview with the visa section at the American Embassy in London due to a ""criminal charge"" against him.
Because of this, the office of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) had refused to intervene. Mr. Band's email made clear the request was on behalf of Casey Wasserman, a sports and entertainment exec who had contributed between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation via the Wasserman Foundation.
These are only two of the many email exchanges in which Ms. Abedin was asked to intervene on behalf of some Clinton Foundation donor. These latest emails fit the same pattern as another batch released earlier this month, which showed Mr. Band asking Ms. Abedin and longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills for a meeting with a U.S. ambassador on behalf of a foreign businessman, as well as seeking a job for someone he described as ""important to take care of.""
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton sums it up this way: ""It looks like the State Department was outsourcing its work to the Clinton Foundation.""
The model worked well for the Clintons, and some believe the Clinton Foundation will be copied by other pols, who will set up spouses or friends with foundations in hopes of attracting the big dollars that they can use to advance their brands, reward their friends and operate as a de facto permanent political campaign--all under the garb of charity.
No doubt some will try. But no one will be as successful as the Clintons have been.
The reason is simple. The Clintons are a business partnership with something that no other political couple has to sell. True, all ex-presidents hit the speaking circuit and have charities and foundations. Even so, the Clintons are unique in having an ex-president with a spouse in play, not only as secretary of state but as a possible president herself. If you are a foreign government or a wealthy businessmen, a donation to the Clinton Foundation might look like an excellent investment at just about any price.
Quid pro quo is notoriously hard to prove in such cases, and we will never know what (if anything) Mrs. Clinton or State delivered in return. We're asked to believe that it was somehow an accident that so many of the millions former President Bill Clinton raked in from speaking fees would come from companies, countries or people who had business before a State Department run by his wife. The truth is, this was inevitable under the Clinton Foundation business model. And it beggars belief to think all these dollars were being given out without an expectation of something in return.
In the meantime we are back to a presidential campaign in which Donald Trump's critics attack his business record by pointing out that the New York City real-estate mogul doesn't even own many of the buildings that bear his name. What he's selling is the Trump brand.
Then again, when it comes to dubious branding for profit, these latest emails make Mr. Trump look like a piker compared with Mrs. Clinton.

Clinton Emails Dealt With Drones --- Messages sent from Pakistan on planned strikes moved on a less-secure system,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795448439?accountid=12768,"At the center of a criminal probe involving Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information is a series of emails between American diplomats in Islamabad and their superiors in Washington about whether to oppose specific drone strikes in Pakistan.
The 2011 and 2012 emails were sent via the ""low side"" -- government slang for a computer system for unclassified matters -- as part of a secret arrangement that gave the State Department more of a voice in whether a Central Intelligence Agency drone strike went ahead, according to congressional and law-enforcement officials briefed on the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe.
Some of the emails were then forwarded by Mrs. Clinton's aides to her personal email account, which routed them to a server she kept at her home in suburban New York when she was secretary of state, the officials said. Investigators have raised concerns that Mrs. Clinton's personal server was less secure than State Department systems.
The vaguely worded messages didn't mention the ""CIA,"" ""drones"" or details about the militant targets, officials said.
The still-secret emails are a key part of the FBI investigation that has long dogged Mrs. Clinton's campaign, these officials said.
They were written within the often-narrow time frame in which State Department officials had to decide whether or not to object to drone strikes before the CIA pulled the trigger, the officials said.
Law-enforcement and intelligence officials said State Department deliberations about the covert CIA drone program should have been conducted over a more secure government computer system designed to handle classified information.
State Department officials told FBI investigators they communicated via the less-secure system on a few instances, according to congressional and law-enforcement officials. It happened when decisions about imminent strikes had to be relayed fast and the U.S. diplomats in Pakistan or Washington didn't have ready access to a more-secure system, either because it was night or they were traveling.
Emails sent over the low side sometimes were informal discussions that occurred in addition to more-formal notifications through secure communications, the officials said.
One such exchange came just before Christmas in 2011, when the U.S. ambassador sent a short, cryptic note to his boss indicating a drone strike was planned. That sparked a back-and-forth among Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers over the next few days, in which it was clear they were having the discussions in part because people were away from their offices for the holiday and didn't have access to a classified computer, officials said.
The CIA drone campaign, though widely reported in Pakistan, is treated as secret by the U.S. government. Under strict U.S. classification rules, U.S. officials have been barred from discussing strikes publicly and even privately outside of secure communications systems.
The State Department said in January that 22 emails on Mrs. Clinton's personal server at her home have been judged to contain top-secret information and aren't being publicly released. Many of them dealt with whether diplomats concurred or not with the CIA drone strikes, congressional and law-enforcement officials said.
Several law-enforcement officials said they don't expect any criminal charges to be filed as a result of the investigation, although a final review of the evidence will be made only after an expected FBI interview with Mrs. Clinton this summer.
One reason is that government workers at several agencies, including the departments of Defense, Justice and State, have occasionally resorted to the low-side system to give each other notice about sensitive but fast-moving events, according to one law-enforcement official.
When Mrs. Clinton has been asked about the possibility of being criminally charged over the email issue, she has repeatedly said ""that is not going to happen."" She has said it was a mistake to use a personal server for email but it was a decision she made as a matter of convenience.
Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said: ""If these officials' descriptions are true, these emails were originated by career diplomats, and the sending of these types of emails was widespread within the government.""
U.S. officials said there is no evidence Pakistani intelligence officials intercepted any of the low-side State Department emails or used them to protect militants.
State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the agency ""is not going to speak to the content of documents, nor would we speak to any ongoing review.""
The email issue has dogged Mrs. Clinton for more than a year. Despite her success in nailing down the Democratic presidential nomination, polls show many voters continue to doubt her truthfulness and integrity. Her campaign manager has acknowledged the email matter has hurt her.
Republican rival Donald Trump has attacked Mrs. Clinton repeatedly on the issue, calling her ""Crooked Hillary,"" saying what she did was a crime and suggesting the Justice Department would let her off because it is run by Democrats.
Beyond the campaign implications, the investigation exposes the latest chapter in a power struggle that pits the enforcers of strict secrecy, including the FBI and CIA, against some officials at the State Department and other agencies who want a greater voice in the use of covert lethal force around the globe, because of the impact it has on broader U.S. policy goals.
In the case of Pakistan, U.S. diplomats found themselves in a difficult position.
Despite being treated as top secret by the CIA, the drone program has long been in the public domain in Pakistan. Television stations there go live with reports of each strike, undermining U.S. efforts to foster goodwill and cooperation against militants through billions of dollars in American aid.
Pakistani officials, while publicly opposing the drone program, secretly consented to the CIA campaign by clearing airspace in the militant-dense tribal areas along the Afghan border, according to former U.S. and Pakistani officials.
CIA and White House officials credit a sharp ramp-up in drone strikes early in Mr. Obama's presidency with battering al Qaeda's leadership in the Pakistani tribal areas and helping protect U.S. forces next door in Afghanistan. Targets have also included some of the Pakistan government's militant enemies.
In 2011, Pakistani officials began to push back in private against the drone program, raising questions for the U.S. over the extent to which the program still had their consent.
U.S. diplomats warned the CIA and White House they risked losing access to Pakistan's airspace unless more discretion was shown, said current and former officials. Within the administration, State Department and military officials argued that the CIA needed to be more ""judicious"" about when strikes were launched. They weren't challenging the spy agency's specific choice of targets, but mainly the timing of strikes.
The CIA initially chafed at the idea of giving the State Department more of a voice in the process. Under a compromise reached around the year 2011, CIA officers would notify their embassy counterparts in Islamabad when a strike in Pakistan was planned, so then-U.S. ambassador Cameron Munter or another senior diplomat could decide whether to ""concur"" or ""non-concur."" Mr. Munter declined to comment.
Diplomats in Islamabad would communicate the decision to their superiors in Washington. A main purpose was to give then-Secretary of State Clinton and her top aides a chance to consider whether she wanted to weigh in with the CIA director about a planned strike.
With the compromise, State Department-CIA tensions began to subside. Only once or twice during Mrs. Clinton's tenure at State did U.S. diplomats object to a planned CIA strike, according to congressional and law-enforcement officials familiar with the emails.
U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and Washington usually relayed and discussed their concur or non-concur decisions via the State Department's more-secure messaging system. But about a half-dozen times, when they were away from more-secure equipment, they improvised by sending emails on their smartphones about whether they backed an impending strike or not, the officials said.
The time available to the State Department to weigh in on a planned strike varied widely, from several days to as little as 20 or 30 minutes. ""If a strike was imminent, it was futile to use the high side, which no one would see for seven hours,"" said one official.
Adding to those communications hurdles, U.S. intelligence officials privately objected to the State Department even using its high-side system. They wanted diplomats to use a still-more-secure system called the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Community Systems, or JWICs. State Department officials don't have ready access to that system, even in Washington. If drone-strike decisions were needed quickly, it wouldn't be an option, officials said.
Some officials chafed at pressure to send internal deliberations through intelligence channels, since they were discussing whether to push back against the CIA, congressional officials said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on the State Department-CIA tug-of-war over the drone program in 2011.
Under pressure to address critics abroad, Mr. Obama pledged to increase the transparency of drone operations by shifting, as much as possible, control of drone programs around the world to the U.S. military instead of the CIA. An exception was made for Pakistan.
But even in Pakistan, Mr. Obama recently signaled a shift. The drone strike that killed Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour last month was conducted by the military, not the CIA, and the outcome was disclosed.

"What Was the Clinton Foundation's Purpose? If the foundation is a charitable organization, then why will it now be rejecting some charitable donations?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813299297?accountid=12768,"In relation to your editorial ""Now the Clintons Tell Us "" (Review & Outlook, Aug. 20), the Clinton Foundation website touts: ""Everywhere we go, we're trying to work ourselves out of a job. Whether it's improving global health, increasing opportunity for girls and women, reducing childhood obesity and preventable diseases, creating economic opportunity and growth, or helping communities address the effects of climate change, we keep score by the lives that are saved or improved.""
I can't say I remember seeing a charitable organization refuse charitable grants. Last I looked, the foundation's stated objectives haven't been accomplished. Imagine the American Red Cross or Salvation Army turning away foreign or corporate donors. I can't.

Article I Section 9 of the Constitution is explicit about such matters: ""And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state."" It is difficult to understand how this leaves wiggle room for Hillary Clinton. Even if you stretch the point and claim that the Senate confirmation of Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state represented ratification of the foundation's dealings by the Senate, no action was ever taken by the House to consent to it. And a promise to get approval for any foreign donations implies recognition that a blanket approval wouldn't be invalid. Logically, each foreign donation would require congressional approval. The Clintons should divest themselves and their foundation of all monies they accepted from foreign governments without congressional approval.

State College, Pa.
Bill and Hillary Clinton have lied to protect their political power and leveraged their public positions to enrich themselves, since he was first elected to office in the late 1970s. While she was secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton said there wouldn't be conflicts of interest regarding the Clinton Foundation and Mr. Clinton. Instead, Mr. Clinton's pay and the donations to the foundation from companies, individuals and countries dealing with the State Department skyrocketed.
It really doesn't matter how many times Mrs. Clinton's image-makers work to reshape her. She isn't going to change what she does because she has been allowed to violate laws without repercussions.

"Election 2016: After Delay, AFL-CIO Prepares to Back Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795833983?accountid=12768,"The nation's largest federation of labor unions is preparing to endorse Hillary Clinton for president this coming week, giving her campaign a boost from one of the Democratic Party's key constituencies.
The AFL-CIO's decision to move toward an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton before Bernie Sanders -- a candidate many labor leaders said embodied more of unions' core values -- has competed in the final Democratic primary Tuesday in Washington, D.C., underscores the belief among union activists that Mrs. Clinton has locked up the nomination. The move also shows the urgency many in labor feel of unifying the party and defeating presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
The AFL-CIO's political committee held a conference call Friday during which members voted to recommend to the general board that the federation endorse Mrs. Clinton, according to a person familiar with the call. The board is expected to agree, as nearly 80% of the unions with officials who sit on the board have already endorsed Mrs. Clinton.
Though the political committee's vote to recommend an endorsement occurred on Friday, the AFL-CIO isn't expected to officially announce an endorsement until Thursday at the earliest, the person familiar with the call said. The political committee is headed by Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which backed Mrs. Clinton months ago.
The AFL-CIO endorsement could give Mrs. Clinton powerful support from union members and their families. Unions spend tens of millions of dollars on elections, mostly to back Democrats, and make millions of phone calls and visits to members' homes and work sites to encourage them to vote.
When the nation's top union officials huddled at an AFL-CIO executive council meeting in February, they decided to put off making an endorsement of any presidential candidate, a relief for Mr. Sanders's campaign and a disappointment for Mrs. Clinton's.
It wasn't clear whether the group had failed to reach the level of support it needed to endorse a candidate at that time, or whether it chose to delay because of splits among some union leaders and rank-and-file members about who to back.
What is clear is that Mr. Sanders's persistence in the race has pushed Mrs. Clinton further to the left on issues ranging from trade to minimum wage.
That could benefit labor unions that care deeply about such issues, and will help them garner votes for the candidate heading toward November.

"Clinton, Trump Duel on Abortion",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795833917?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton plunged into general-election combat on Friday, and immediately showed voters the starkly different choices they represent in their views of abortion, women's issues and the Supreme Court's future.
Speaking in Washington, D.C., to core political constituencies at almost the same time, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton tried to energize their supporters with a fearsome vision of what would happen if their opponent wins the presidential election in the fall.
The Republican Mr. Trump, speaking to a conference of evangelical conservatives, warned Mrs. Clinton would ""appoint radical judges"" to the Supreme Court -- the top concern for many of the antiabortion activists in the audience.
""She will push for federal funding for abortion on demand,"" he said at a conference organized by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a group of religious conservatives.
Mrs. Clinton, delivering her first campaign speech since wrapping up the Democratic contest this week, warned that abortion rights and other women's priorities would be imperiled under a Trump presidency.
""When Donald Trump says, 'Let's make America great again,' that is code for 'Let's take America backward,'"" she said in a speech to Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the political arm of the women's health organization. ""Well, Donald, those days are over.""
The split-screen day of campaign events was the first clear-cut round of general-election sparring, now that the two parties have their presumptive nominees. Mr. Trump cleared his field of rivals a month ago, whereas Mrs. Clinton conducted a two-front battle until this week against the New York businessman and her primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The dueling events underscore how a central issue for mobilizing voters in both parties will be concern about the future composition of the Supreme Court, which has been short one member since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this year.
President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, a U.S. appeals court judge, to succeed Justice Scalia. Republicans have said they won't hold a vote to confirm him, because they believe the next president should fill the vacancy that could shift the court toward a progressive stance or restore its previous conservative majority. Democrats say that the GOP refusal to act is politically motivated obstructionism.
Mr. Trump spoke to the evangelical group as part of a broader effort to win over a sometimes-wary core constituency that is important to GOP grass-roots mobilization.
Although Mr. Trump, the thrice-married billionaire who used to support abortion rights, isn't a natural fit for many social conservatives, he gained leverage from the fact that many in the audience cared more than anything about who will pick the next justices on the Supreme Court.
""It's down to two choices now, and he has to be our choice,"" said Debbie Lawrence, a 64-year-old from Arkansas. ""I'm not going to be on his campaign, but I will encourage conservative evangelicals to vote for him, even if we're not sure he's in the same camp with us.""
In his speech, Mr. Trump pointed to what was perhaps his most important step of his campaign toward easing concerns on the religious right: the list he released last month of judges with conservative credentials whom he would consider for the vacancy.
Mr. Trump made no mention of the controversy that has been dogging his campaign for weeks, the allegations of racism in response to his claim that the federal judge overseeing litigation about Trump University cannot be impartial because of the judge's Mexican heritage.
Mr. Trump read his speech almost entirely from a teleprompter -- the latest sign that he is taking seriously Republicans who have urged him to rein in his freewheeling speaking style.
For Mrs. Clinton, opening her face-off with Mr. Trump at a Planned Parenthood event drew attention to her historic status as the first female nominee of a major party.
The speech is part of a concerted effort by Mrs. Clinton and her campaign to rally support among women, where she enjoys an advantage, and in particular to win over Republican-leaning, suburban women who might otherwise not support a Democrat for president.
The former secretary of state and New York senator pointed to past comments where Mr. Trump insulted women as ""pigs,"" ""dogs"" and ""disgusting animals"" and called pregnant women an inconvenience for employers.
""Donald assures us as president he will be 'the best' for women,"" she said. ""Anyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood and wipe out safe and legal abortion has no idea what's best for women. It's kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights.""
Her remarks were a full-throated endorsement for her host, Planned Parenthood, which has come under attack from Republicans in Washington and many state capitals, because it is the nation's largest abortion provider, though most of its services are for other women's health issues. Eleven states have cut funding for the organization.
Democrats are counting on that becoming a winning issue, as it was in 2012, when the president made backing for the group central to his pitch to women. Many women associate Planned Parenthood with contraception, not abortion, and many have personally used its services at one time.
""I've been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time. And as president, I will always have your back,"" Mrs. Clinton said.
In pointing to the importance of the Supreme Court, Mrs. Clinton noted that a Texas law imposing strict requirements on abortion providers is now under review. She also criticized Mr. Trump's comments, later retracted, that women who have abortions should be penalized.
""Anyone who would so casually agree to the idea of punishing women . . . that is someone who doesn't hold women in high regard,"" she said. ""Because if he did, he'd trust women to make the right decisions for ourselves.""

Election 2016: Warren Set for Big Campaign Role --- Democrats see Friday's meeting with Clinton as a step toward party unity,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795613215?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton huddled for an hour Friday with Sen. Elizabeth Warren in what many Democrats see as an important step in unifying the party after its bruising presidential primary.
The Massachusetts senator is set to play a key role, both as a determined and pointed critic of Republican Donald Trump and as someone whom liberal supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders inherently trust. Friday's meeting also fueled chatter -- highly speculative -- that Mrs. Clinton would pick her as a running mate.
Before Mr. Sanders launched his long-shot run for president, the party's liberals had urged Ms. Warren to run. She declined, and she also wouldn't endorse either candidate in the long primary, making her one of the most prominent Democrats to remain neutral.
""The perfect person to be helpful is Elizabeth Warren, because she didn't take a stand for either one,"" Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) volunteered when asked about unification. ""I think that may be perfect for her.""
In recent weeks, Ms. Warren has been ramping up her role in the campaign, sharply attacking Mr. Trump without mentioning either Democrat, and then on Thursday endorsing Mrs. Clinton.
Mr. Sanders says he will continue to campaign through the last primary, on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., but he hasn't indicated what he will do after that. On Thursday, Ms. Warren declared flatly, ""Hillary Clinton won. And she won because she's a fighter, she's out there, she's tough.""
Mrs. Clinton returned the affection. Speaking before the Planned Parenthood Action Fund on Friday, she mentioned the Warren endorsement in the same breath as those from President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. ""So it's been a big week,"" she said.
In their meeting Friday at Mrs. Clinton's Washington home, she and Ms. Warren discussed working together over the coming campaign to advance their agendas and block Mr. Trump, officials said.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers view Ms. Warren as an ascending leader, whose liberal followers give her an influence well beyond her short Senate tenure. Lawmakers speak with reverence of her Facebook following and the fact that Mr. Trump regularly responds to her attacks.
Following the 2014 midterm elections, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid named Ms. Warren a top adviser to Senate Democrats' policy and communications arm.
Before being elected to the Senate in 2012, Ms. Warren had already made her mark. An expert on bankruptcy and a law professor at Harvard University, she served as chairman of the congressionally appointed watchdog panel of the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program and then set up the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she pushed Congress to create.
""Nobody has the integrity when it comes to Wall Street and reining in the excesses of our capitalist society . . . like Elizabeth Warren,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., Ill.) said Friday.
Republicans have said Ms. Warren is hypocritical for railing against Wall Street, then endorsing Mrs. Clinton, who has given highly paid speeches to big financial institutions.
At times, Ms. Warren's sharp political skills have complicated the life of Democratic leaders. In December 2014, she opposed a provision in a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would have scaled back language in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law, and nearly derailed the legislation.
Some liberal lawmakers said they would prefer Ms. Warren as a running mate over a more centrist Democrat such as Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.
""Sen. Kaine's a wonderful public servant, but if you really want to electrify the base, you've got to get somebody who's been speaking to the base and is going to turn the base out,"" Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Friday.

Election 2016: Clinton Urges Ban on Sales Of Certain Guns,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796116322?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- Democrat Hillary Clinton, in her first extended response to the massacre in Orlando, denounced ""inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric"" and pushed for stricter gun laws, including the reinstatement of a ban on the sort of assault weapons used by the Florida gunman.
""If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorists links, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun,"" she said here in a reference to two prior anti-terrorism investigations of Omar Mateen, the shooter who was killed Sunday by police. Those probes were eventually closed without action taken.
Her remarks Monday offered a sharp contrast to the reaction of her likely Republican rival, Donald Trump. He countered in Manchester, N.H., by blaming the weekend attack, in part, on lax immigration laws, and appeared to broaden his pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country by including immigrants from any country ""with a proven history of terrorism against the U.S., Europe or our allies.""
The dueling foreign-policy speeches, on a day when both candidates initially promised to avoid the typical campaign trail sniping, showed voters just how differently each candidate would respond to the kind of terror threat posed by the lone gunman who killed at least 49 people at a popular gay nightclub in Orlando over the weekend.
Mrs. Clinton avoided the kind of harsh rhetoric that has defined the early back-and-forth between the presumptive Democratic nominee and her likely GOP rival. But she did take some implicit swipes at Mr. Trump and his angry, partisan response to the Orlando shootings in a gay nightclub by a Muslim American who swore allegiance to ISIS. Among other things, he has called on President Barack Obama to resign and Mrs. Clinton to quit the presidential race.
Mrs. Clinton denounced ""inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric"" and politics of division saying, ""We are not a land of winners and losers."" She contrasted the current political climate with the bipartisan response in the days following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when she was a U.S. senator from New York, while New York City's mayor, the state's governor and the U.S. president were all Republicans.
""We did not attack each other; we worked together,"" she said. ""It is time to get back to the spirit of those days.""
Mrs. Clinton promised that, as president, she would beef up counterterrorism measures and make a top priority of ""identifying and stopping lone wolves"" -- domestic terrorists operating on their own, often with inspiration from ISIS.
She called for more resources for intelligence gathering and law enforcement at home, and working with allies to continue military attacks on ISIS abroad. She angrily called on the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other U.S. allies in the Middle East to stop allowing their citizens to finance extremists.
But her most impassioned -- and well received -- response was to make a link between stopping domestic terrorism and imposing new restrictions on guns. She renewed her call to revive a federal ban on so-called assault weapons.
In his speech, Mr. Trump attacked Mrs. Clinton's push to reinstate the long-lapsed ban.
Mrs. Clinton spoke as the 2016 campaign has been shaken by the Orlando shootings, turning the focus to national-security issues, gun control and questions about which candidate is better suited to be commander-in-chief and to combat terrorism at home and abroad.
Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump reworked their campaign schedules to address the Orlando massacre.
The adjustment on both sides was a reminder of how abruptly the course of the presidential campaign may yet be altered by world events.

Shooting Heightens Trump-Clinton Divide,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795819703?accountid=12768,"The mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., elevated an issue that Republican Donald Trump has been stressing throughout his presidential campaign: the threat posed by jihadists bent on killing Americans at home.
Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, on Sunday emphasized other dynamics. She said the U.S. must work with ""allies and partners"" to foil terrorists. She also made note of the gay and lesbian targets of the killings, denouncing ""an act of hate"" against a community that is part of the political coalition she hopes will help her defeat Mr. Trump.
""We will keep fighting for your right to live free, openly and without fear,"" she said.
With images from Orlando blanketing TV screens, Mr. Trump stressed in a series of tweets that the attack came from an Islamic extremist and suggested conventional Democratic policies backed by President Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton are inadequate to the task of wiping out terrorism.
""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,"" he wrote in one.
Mr. Obama condemned what he called an ""act of terror and an act of hate,"" calling on Americans to stand united in the wake of the deadliest shooting rampage in the country's history.
The Orlando attack is the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken Americans in recent years, including the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting and the Fort Hood shootings in Texas.
""Trump's strength arises from frustration and fear,"" said Michael Oren, a historian and former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. The Orlando massacre ""deepens the fear and heightens the frustration that many Americans do not feel safe.""
Mr. Trump has ground to make up when it comes to persuading voters he would do a better job than Mrs. Clinton keeping the nation safe. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last month showed that registered voters believed by a 10-point margin the former secretary of state would be a better commander-in-chief.
Since entering the race, Mr. Trump has taken a hard-line stance on terrorism that proved popular in the GOP primary fight. He called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and promised that he would ""quickly and decisively bomb the hell out of ISIS."" He also faulted Mr. Obama for a strategy that, he said, is ""losing the war on terrorism.""
The Muslim ban has come under widespread criticism and Mr. Trump last month described the ban as merely a proposal. But Trump advisers believe the mass slaughter at a gay bar in Orlando -- carried out by a man who pledged allegiance to Islamic State -- will help demonstrate that Mr. Trump is bringing a plain-spoken urgency to the issue of terrorism that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton both lack.
Indeed, he seems to be embracing the Muslim ban anew. In another tweet Sunday, he wrote: ""Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough."" In a separate statement Sunday, he said: ""I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct any more."" He said he planned a speech on terrorism, immigration and national security on Monday.
Not since 2004, when Osama bin Laden issued a videotape weeks before the contest between President George W. Bush and John Kerry, has terror been such a prominent campaign issue, said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University in Washington. ""It's in the interests of these groups to provoke polarization in our society,"" he said.
A former GOP rival whom Mr. Trump defeated, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, issued a statement calling for a more aggressive approach. ""It is a time for action,"" he said.
""We need a commander-in-chief who will speak the truth and who will unleash the full force and fury of the American military to utterly destroy ISIS and its affiliates.""
Americans rattled by deadly terrorist attacks, Trump advisers say, will see in his policies a course-correction that Mrs. Clinton is unwilling to take. ""People are concerned about the fact that this will happen everywhere. The question is not theoretical -- it's blood-covered,"" said Walid Phares, a Trump foreign-policy adviser.
Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri suggested Mr. Trump is trying to capitalize on the strategy.
While Mrs. Clinton ""has a comprehensive plan to combat ISIS at home and abroad,"" she said, ""Donald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes and self-congratulations. Trump has offered no real plans to keep our nation safe and no outreach to the Americans targeted, just insults and attacks.""

Election 2016: Clinton Ad Portrays Her as a Uniter,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795816863?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Democrat Hillary Clinton is launching her general election campaign in earnest this week with a speech Monday in the battleground state of Ohio and a new television ad that casts her as a leader who can bring the nation together, while Republican Donald Trump pits people against one another.
The TV spot, which will begin airing on Thursday, opens with an image of the Statue of Liberty, as Mrs. Clinton says ""we face a choice about who we are as a nation."" It then cuts to footage of Mr. Trump from a February rally where he says of a protester, ""I'd like to punch him in the face."" It also shows Mr. Trump imitating a reporter with a disability in what many saw as mocking.
Mrs. Clinton is shown with children, with workers, in a round-table discussion and walking off a U.S. government jet as she talks about working with allies around the world, an image that evokes her service as secretary of state.
""What kind of America do we want to be?"" she asks. ""Dangerously divided, or strong and united? I believe we are always stronger together.""
Mr. Trump criticized the ad in a tweet on Sunday. ""Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!""
An aide said Mrs. Clinton's speech in Cleveland would sound the same themes and frame her view of the choice now that both parties have effectively chosen their nominees.
While Mr. Trump is viewed poorly by a large number of Americans, Mrs. Clinton also has low favorability numbers, and the ad seems aimed at both highlighting what voters don't like about Mr. Trump while trying to show Mrs. Clinton in a warm light. It closes with her warmly putting her arm around a girl at a rally and pulling her close. In three other moments during the 60-second spot she is also shown hugging someone or with her arm on a shoulder.
In recent days, Mrs. Clinton has sharply criticized Mr. Trump, the billionaire businessman, calling his foreign policy ""dangerously incoherent"" and saying he would imperil women's rights. She also plans an economic speech that will cast his agenda as ""deeply misguided.""
But this week's message will deliver a positive view of her own vision along with the critique of his. In the TV spot, she mentions ending the ""partisan divide and gridlock,"" and building an economy that ""works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" themes she sounded during the primaries.
Ohio is a perennial battleground state and one that will be critical for Mr. Trump to win. On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton goes to Pittsburgh, and while Pennsylvania has voted Democratic in presidential elections since 1988, some have predicted that Mr. Trump's appeal to white working-class voters would put the state into play.
Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to campaign with President Barack Obama in Green Bay, Wis., on Wednesday, but the event was postponed because of the shootings in Orlando.
The new TV ad will begin airing Thursday in battleground states, the Clinton aide said.
Mr. Trump had said he would deliver a speech Monday on ""all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons."" But on Sunday, he said the speech would address the Orlando attack and his broader themes on immigration and national security.

Election 2016: Clinton Is Quiet on Business Taxes --- Democratic candidate hasn't said whether she backs Obama's proposal to cut rates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794080283?accountid=12768,"Democrats and Republicans are diverging on how to alter the business tax code, complicating the prospects for a deal in a policy area where a bipartisan agreement once looked possible.
The Democrats' new emphasis is most visible in the campaign of presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. She hasn't embraced President Barack Obama's proposal to cut the corporate tax rate to 28% from 35%, part of his broader framework that includes curtailing some tax breaks and reducing the U.S. tax code's preference for debt financing.
Meanwhile, Republicans are seeking even deeper rate cuts than they did two years ago.
Mrs. Clinton hasn't said whether or not she supports lowering the 35% rate, and her campaign hasn't responded to requests for comment. Her business-tax focus has instead included targeted tax credits for apprenticeships and profit-sharing with employees, paired with tighter rules to keep companies from putting their legal addresses outside the U.S. and pushing profits abroad.
The former secretary of state also has talked about ""business tax reform"" to pay for $275 billion in infrastructure spending. A rate-cutting revamp of the tax code could generate revenue for infrastructure by eliminating tax breaks and by imposing a one-time tax on more than $2 trillion that companies have stockpiled offshore.
Mrs. Clinton's approach on the rate cut could be strategic. If she is elected president, it could be a bargaining chip for her promised legislative push for infrastructure spending in early 2017. Republicans would face a choice of working with her or waiting at least four more years for a shot to make major tax changes.
""A Clinton presidency would lay down principles and set up the walls within which the debate would occur,"" said David Brown, deputy director of the economic program at Third Way, a center-left think tank. ""There is a lot of flexibility within that principle.""
Mrs. Clinton's lack of emphasis on cutting the statutory rate follows a strand of Democratic thinking that emphasizes closing gaps in the tax base and analyzing companies' effective tax rates, where the U.S. is less out of step with the rest of the world than it is with its world-high marginal rate of 35%.
""The last 12 months, I think, have illustrated how much Swiss cheese there is in our tax code and the ability of taxpayers to exploit loopholes,"" said Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, top Democrat on the House Ways and Means panel. ""That's why there's been less focus on exactly where tax reform is going.""
The case for lowering the rate -- pressed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Obama and Republicans -- is that the gap between the U.S. rate and other countries hurts U.S. companies in the global economy and encourages them to shift investment and profits overseas. Reducing that incentive, the president's tax plan said, would ""alleviate the significant economic distortions.""
It took Mr. Obama four years to move from campaign proposals that emphasized higher taxes on U.S. firms' foreign earnings to the rate cut. Since 2012, he has supported a 28% corporate tax rate with a 25% rate for manufacturers. For years, Republicans proposed a 25% rate.
That overlap never turned into law, blocked by disagreement on details and questions about whether to change the tax code for individuals as well. Efforts to change international tax rules without touching the corporate rate also haven't advanced.
Republicans are now advocating even bigger rate cuts. Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the Ways and Means panel, wants to ""leapfrog"" other countries by taking the rate to 20% or below, and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump favors a 15% rate as part of his tax-cut plan. House Republicans are slated to release a tax-overhaul blueprint soon.
Further, the idea of cutting the rate and removing wasteful tax breaks ran into the problem that there is no consensus on which tax breaks are wasteful. In 2014, then-Rep. Dave Camp's tax proposal would have raised more than $500 billion over a decade by requiring companies to spread out deductions for capital investments, research expenses and advertising costs, making up the majority of the financing for his corporate rate cut.
But manufacturers and many Democrats and Republicans are wary of repealing accelerated depreciation because of the potential negative effect on investment and jobs, and fiscal hawks warn that much of the revenue comes from shifting deductions outside the budgetary scoring window.
""If you eliminate that to pay for the rate cut, you're actually undermining the central goal oftaxreform, which is to promote that economic growth and job creation,"" said Kevin Dempsey, senior vice president for public policy at the American Iron and Steel Institute, who helps lead a coalition favoring accelerated writeoffs.

Election 2016: Clinton Crosses Threshold To Secure Nomination,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794079989?accountid=12768,"LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Hillary Clinton secured the delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination Monday night, according a tally by the Associated Press, crossing a historic milestone as she campaigned in California and pushed to end a long presidential primary campaign on a high note.
Mrs. Clinton, who was only 23 delegates shy of the 2,383 needed for victory after Sunday's Puerto Rico primary, received commitments from additional delegates late Monday. Just a day before Tuesday's contests in California and five other states, Mrs. Clinton emerged as her party's presumptive nominee and the first woman to lead the ticket for a major U.S. political party.
The former secretary of state had been expected to win the delegates needed to secure victory in Tuesday's primaries, but a last-minute show of support from a number of superdelegates pushed her across the finish line a day earlier.
After a protracted and contentious primary season, the battle for the Democratic nomination ended with little fanfare. Mrs. Clinton and her advisers declined to take a victory lap, saying that they remained focused on notching wins in Tuesday's contests.
Speaking in Long Beach, Calif., on Monday, Mrs. Clinton, said, ""According to the news, we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment, but we still have work to do, don't we?""
Sen. Bernie Sanders spent Monday in the San Francisco Bay area. While he said he would do ""everything I can"" to win the 475 pledged delegates up for grabs in California, he toned down his rhetoric on continuing his campaign, sounding less determined to fight through the Democratic National Convention in July.
Mr. Sanders's campaign rejected the assertion that Mrs. Clinton is now the presumptive nominee, noting that the delegate total includes superdelegates, who still could change their minds before the Democratic convention in July.
""It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgment, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee's clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,"" said Michael Briggs, Mr. Sanders's spokesman.
The last big primary day on the calendar comes as President Barack Obama is poised to enter the fray and endorse the party's presumed nominee. The president spoke over the weekend with Mr. Sanders, according to a person with knowledge of the phone call, but it isn't known what the men discussed.
The six states on Tuesday -- New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota are the others -- will award a combined total of nearly 700 delegates. Mrs. Clinton holds a substantial lead over Mr. Sanders both in pledged delegates and superdelegates, party leaders or elected officials who are free to support either candidate.
Polls show a race that is too close to call in California.
Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have campaigned separately across the state.The former senator and secretary of state on Monday was in the Los Angeles area, where she held rallies and planned to host a star-studded evening concert.
Mr. Sanders has planted a flag in California, focusing all of his attention and resources on the state during the past couple of weeks.
In a news conference Monday in Emeryville, Mr. Sanders declined to say whether he would consider endorsing Mrs. Clinton before the convention if he doesn't win Tuesday's contest.
""You're asking me to speculate,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Let me talk to you after the primary in California. Let's assess where we are after tomorrow before we make statements based on speculation.""
On Monday, the senator said he would continue to make his case to superdelegates, urging them to switch their allegiance to his campaign. But his remarks were devoid of declarations he had made previously that he would continue his campaign through the convention. During the weekend, he predicted the July convention would be a contested one and vowed to keep fighting after Tuesday's primaries.
Mrs. Clinton, for her part, said it was important for Democrats to unite during the coming weeks.
Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist who supports Mrs. Clinton, said Tuesday's results ultimately won't change the outcome of the primary campaign or have a significant impact on Mrs. Clinton's prospects in the general election.
""She is going to be the Democratic nominee for president whether she wins California or not,"" he said. ""It's always better to win than to lose, but at the end of the day, the process will be over.""

Competition Keeps Drugs Reasonably Priced; Hillary Clinton's price controls will only result in shortages of the medicine.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814470656?accountid=12768,"As the Journal points out (""Anaphylactic Political Shock ,"" Review and Outlook, Aug. 25), the most effective means of keeping vital drugs (or of anything, for that matter) reasonably priced is competition in a free market. Relying on human kindness to keep drug prices reasonable is grasping at a thin reed. But depending on regulation to achieve the same goal is fraught with unintended consequences, especially when administered by politicians and bureaucrats with a limited understanding of economics, as the EpiPen episode makes clear.
It is ironic that those screaming the most loudly about Mylan's unconscionable price increases for EpiPens are the same people who, by having the Federal Drug Administration kill off competition, provided Mylan with a monopoly for this type of product and the opportunity and incentive for such nefarious pricing behavior.
Mark Quinn
Naperville, Ill.
Epinephrine injections are a necessity for those with severe allergic reactions. These injections add a $750 yearly cost, $1500 if the patient is a school-age child.
At least part of this cost would be alleviated if schools could use one set of EpiPens for all students. But health-care laws prevent this and require the school store one set of EpiPens for each allergic student.
In 2011 Illinois made it possible for doctors to prescribe EpiPens to a school instead of to individual patients. In New Jersey a similar bill was proposed but hasn't been passed.
E. Gunnar Tarnow
Fair Lawn, N.J.
Steep price hikes from Mylan, manufacturer of EpiPens, put the adrenaline-filled injectors out of reach for many who suffer from allergies: a two-pack now goes for ""$500 or more after insurance discounts and coupons,"" the Journal writes in the editorial. Equally culpable, is the FDA, whose testing hurdles have prevented other manufacturers from bringing cheaper, generic equivalents to market.
What doesn't make sense is that preteenage girls can buy the morning-after pill for as little as $35, sometimes less. And naloxone (Narcan), a drug that reverses heroin overdoses, can be obtained for about $20 to $40 a dose.
Bill Apple
New York
Two of my children need EpiPens and I have to buy them when school starts every year, so I know that the price is becoming prohibitive. But Hillary Clinton's price controls will only result in shortages of the medicine. More families will be hurt than helped by Mrs. Clinton's policies

"Election 2016: Clinton Seeks Sanders Backing, Voter List --- Rival still not ready to endorse former secretary of state as she wins final primary",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796453031?accountid=12768,"The Democratic presidential race officially came to an end Tuesday with Hillary Clinton winning the primary in the District of Columbia, and now the negotiations with her rival Bernie Sanders begin in earnest.
Mrs. Clinton wants Mr. Sanders to endorse her for president and deploy his email list to persuade his supporters to unite behind her, campaign advisers say, in hopes of bridging differences within the party and leaving Democrats best positioned to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the general election.
But for now, Mr. Sanders is withholding his endorsement as he presses Mrs. Clinton and Democratic leaders to agree to some of the liberal policy goals and electoral changes he touted on the campaign trail.
The two met Tuesday night at a hotel near the White House as the votes were being counted in the last of the 57 Democratic contests. In similarly worded statements later, they said they had a positive discussion about how to unify the party, bring more people into the political process ""and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation.""
The two, joined by top campaign aides and Jane Sanders, the candidate's wife, also discussed the Democratic Party platform, which Mr. Sanders wants to tilt in a more liberal direction. ""Sanders and Clinton agreed to continue working to develop a progressive agenda that addresses the needs of working families and the middle class and adopting a progressive platform for the Democratic National Convention,"" the Sanders statement said.
Tuesday's Washington, D.C., primary results -- Clinton posted a 79% to 21% win -- had no practical effect on the race. With a combination of 2,784 pledged and superdelegates ahead of the result, Mrs. Clinton already had become the party's presumptive nominee, having easily cleared the 2,383 delegate threshold.
While Sanders aides say his campaign is still ""active,"" they indicated that he accepts the mathematical realities and understands he can no longer wrest the nomination from Mrs. Clinton. Speaking outside a campaign office in Washington earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders called for the ouster of Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, depicting her as more focused on raising campaign funds than expanding the party and imbuing it with fresh energy.
""We need a person at the leadership of the DNC who is vigorously supporting and out working to bring people into the political process,"" he said.
Ms. Wasserman Schultz told MSNBC Tuesday she wouldn't step down.
Mr. Sanders, who identified as an independent until entering the presidential race, also called for the elimination of superdelegates -- the hundreds of party leaders and elected officials who have an outsize influence on the nomination. Party officials created the superdelegate system to head off debacles such as Democratic Sen. George McGovern's landslide defeat in 1972. The idea is that superdelegates could intervene should voters produce a nominee seen as unelectable.
Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) took part in a meeting at Mr. Sanders's home in Burlington, Vt., over the weekend to talk about his next steps.
""He wants to spend a lot of time thinking about how to drive forward this agenda, to basically take on the big issues facing America,"" Mr. Merkley said in an interview.
Clinton aides seem willing to accommodate Mr. Sanders up to a point. But they also stress it's incumbent on him to help mobilize his supporters. One step they see as helpful is Mr. Sanders using his email list to help make the case for victory over Mr. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump in recent polls, and was up by more than four points in the average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics.
Mr. Sanders will be speaking to supporters via video message on Thursday evening to discuss his political future. ""I told you that I run not to oppose any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching policies to deal with the crises of our time,"" he said in a statement. ""After June 14, the voting is done, but our political revolution continues.""
Both candidates campaigned in the city in advance of the primary campaign, and touted their support for D.C. statehood, which would give city residents full representation in Congress.
Mr. Sanders held a rally outside of RFK Stadium, drawing a large crowd. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton visited a muffin shop in the city's rapidly developing Shaw neighborhood, flanked by city council members Jack Evans and Anita Bonds, as well as Washington's nonvoting delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton.

Politics & Ideas: Where Clinton and Trump Agree on Terror,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796399320?accountid=12768,"Monday's dueling speeches in response to the Orlando massacre offered a preview of the general election. Hillary Clinton attacked the problem without mentioning Donald Trump; Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton and, for good measure, Barack Obama, whom he addressed in terms too vile to be believed if uttered by anyone else. Conspiracy theory, the cesspool of conservative populism, is Mr. Trump's native habitat.
The presumptive presidential nominees disagree fundamentally about the origins of the threat we face. Mrs. Clinton believes that the current wave of violent extremism represents a perversion of Islam. The overwhelming majority of Muslims here and abroad, she insists, are ""peaceful people"" who reject this ideology. That is why it would be wrong to ""declare war on an entire religion.""
Mr. Trump believes that what he calls radical Islamic terrorism is an intensification of Islam rather than a distortion of it. In harmony with 68% of Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center in a December 2015 survey, he thinks that Islam is more likely than other faiths to encourage violence among its adherents.
This conceptual divide spills over into practice. Mr. Trump demands that Muslim communities in America cooperate with law enforcement ""to turn in the people who they know are bad."" This should pose no difficulty, he adds, because Muslims ""know what's going on,"" including the real intentions of the perpetrators of the horrors in Orlando and San Bernardino. Along with President Obama and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan, Mrs. Clinton believes that most homegrown terrorists keep to themselves, their inclinations known only to a few friends or no one at all. If so, insisting that Muslim communities know about the dangerous people in their midst will only diminish their willingness to cooperate with law enforcement.
There are other policy differences between the candidates. Mrs. Clinton believes that it should be more difficult to buy the assault weapons that have figured so prominently in recent episodes of mass carnage; Mr. Trump responds with an appeal to the Second Amendment, broadly construed. Mr. Trump wants a temporary ban on immigration from areas of the world with a history of terrorism against the U.S., a proposal Mrs. Clinton regards as self-defeating as well as a violation of core American principles. And Mr. Trump thinks that the words we use to characterize our adversaries matter a lot, while Mrs. Clinton wants us to focus on what we do to them: What matters is that we killed Osama bin Laden, not what we called him as we did the deed.
Still, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump agree on two important points.
The first is a shift in the kind of threat America faces. The U.S. response to 9/11 was designed to minimize the chance that acts of this sort -- attacks from abroad -- would happen again. We adopted new laws and procedures to meet new threats.
These antiterrorism efforts proved remarkably successful and have enjoyed a substantial measure of support across party lines. There have been fierce controversies about detention policies, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and using lethal force against American citizens abroad. But the policies have been sustainable because respected leaders in both parties agreed that they should continue.
Now, though, the candidates agree that we must pivot to meet a new threat, not from abroad, but from within. Homegrown terrorism is hard to anticipate, let alone prevent. All too often, the difference between spikes of anger and murderous intent is detectable only in retrospect. And American citizens are entitled to the full range of legal and constitutional protections, which rule out some tactics that might be effective.
This brings us to the second area of agreement between the candidates -- the need to reconfigure and intensify intelligence efforts in response to threats that are increasingly homegrown. Mrs. Clinton recommends an ""intelligence surge"" backed by the tools and resources needed to identify domestic extremists before they act. Mr. Trump says that we need an intelligence-gathering system that is ""second to none,"" with enhanced cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement at all levels of the federal system.
I have a suggestion that would, if accepted, drive down cable-news ratings: When the dust settles, refocus the discussion on these areas where the candidates and parties broadly agree. If the new threat is homegrown terrorism, how should laws, policies and practices be reconfigured to meet it? If the centerpiece of the response is improved domestic intelligence, what would this mean operationally?
The location of the line between measures that are aggressive but acceptable and those that breach legal or constitutional limits will be a matter of continuing controversy, but this is where the real work will be done once we stop yelling at each other -- if we ever do.

"Former Medical School Professor Arrested in Chappaqua, N.Y., Shooting; Dean of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and another person were wounded in shooting at deli near Clintons' home",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814765805?accountid=12768,"A former faculty member was arrested Monday in the shooting of a medical school dean and another person at a deli in Chappaqua, N.Y., the upscale Westchester County hamlet where presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lives.
One of the wounded is Dennis Charney, dean of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan.
""This is an extremely disturbing event,"" said Kenneth Davis, chief executive of Mount Sinai Health System. ""Fortunately, Dr. Charney's injuries are not life-threatening and we expect he will fully recover.""
The shooting took place around 7 a.m. Monday at Lange's Little Store & Delicatessen. Police said they responded to reports of shots fired and found two victims with gunshot wounds.
Police identified the alleged shooter as Chao Hengjun, 49 years old, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., who was arrested at the deli. He couldn't be reached for comment, and it wasn't clear if he had an attorney.
Mr. Chao was a Mount Sinai faculty member who was terminated for cause in 2010, according to Mount Sinai officials. Police said he appeared to be motivated by an old workplace dispute.
""I think he came up here intent on shooting someone,"" New Castle Police Chief Charles Ferry said during a news conference Monday. Chappaqua is in the town of New Castle.
Dr. Charney and the other victim, whose name wasn't released, were taken to Westchester Medical Center. The second victim was also expected to survive.
Mr. Chao sued Mount Sinai, Dr. Charney and others employed at Mount Sinai in 2010 for discrimination. According to court documents, Mr. Chao, formerly an assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai, filed the lawsuit following an internal investigation that found that he committed research misconduct. The lawsuit was dismissed.
Investigators recovered a shotgun in Mr. Chao's car, which, based on an initial investigation, had been fired once or twice, police said. Chief Ferry said Mr. Chao was arrested without incident and was cooperating with police.
Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have lived in Chappaqua for several years. Their home is about a mile away from the shooting scene.

Hillary Clinton Aide Huma Abedin Says She Is Separating From Husband Anthony Weiner; Move follows a report that he exchanged sexually-charged messages and photos with another woman,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814726415?accountid=12768,"Huma Abedin, a top aide to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, said Monday that she is separating from her husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner, following a report that he had exchanged sexually-charged messages and photos with another woman.
""After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,"" Ms. Abedin said in a statement. ""Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.""
The behavior reported by the New York Post was similar to previous incidents in which Mr. Weiner sent messages and photos to various women. He resigned from Congress in 2011, after the first reports of these incidents occurred.
He attempted a political comeback, running for mayor of New York City in 2013. He was running near the top of the polls when new reports of online sexual flirtations surfaced. At that time, Ms. Abedin stood by him. The race and the scandal that engulfed was featured in a documentary movie , ""Weiner,"" released this year.
On Monday, the New York Post reported a series of messages that the paper described as between Mr. Weiner and a woman it didn't identify. His toddler son was visible in one of the photos he sent her.
Mr. Weiner told the Post that he had never met the woman and that they ""have been friends for some time.""

"Election 2016: Campaigns Target Economy --- Clinton to swipe at Trump's business record, while he readies his response",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797844263?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton will target Donald Trump's business record on Tuesday, casting the presumptive Republican nominee as self-interested and deceptive as he prepares to provide more details about his economic proposals during the coming weeks.
Tuesday's address in Columbus, Ohio, will build on Mrs. Clinton's recent foreign-policy speech in which she used a compilation of Mr. Trump's own words to suggest that he is uninformed and even dangerous.
""It really comes down to being able to show that every time Trump had an opportunity to get something for himself at the expense of someone else, he took it, in spades,"" said Jake Sullivan, the Clinton campaign's policy chief.
Mr. Trump, for his part, plans to unveil new details about a regulatory overhaul, spending cuts and modifications to his tax plan designed to reduce projected deficits and provide additional growth incentives, according to a person close to the campaign.
Mr. Trump is also poised to punch back at his rival's characterization of him, saying in an interview that he is a ""great businessman"" and that Mrs. Clinton is a ""total disaster.""
""I own some of the greatest properties. I even took bad deals and turned them into good deals, so my business record is phenomenal,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I've employed thousands of people, and now her business record -- she has no clue.""
The coming Clinton speech is an attempt to strike at the heart of a campaign of a candidate with no political experience but a decadeslong history in the business world. While Mr. Trump has argued he would be a champion for the working class, Mrs. Clinton will counter that his career has been focused on enriching himself, often at a cost to others, advisers said.
Mrs. Clinton plans to highlight some of Mr. Trump's more controversial economic policy statements, including his calls for imposing tariffs on China and Mexico, a move that could risk dual trade wars, and his suggestion that the U.S. might try to renegotiate the national debt, an idea he later rescinded, aides said.
She also will point to specific ventures, including Trump University, which is now at the center of lawsuits accusing the business of fleecing students.
Mrs. Clinton's economic argument against her likely general-election rival is one of three pillars of her campaign's Trump attack, aides said. Foreign policy and the theme of unity versus division are the other areas of focus.
In a recent interview, Mrs. Clinton said she would draw attention to Mr. Trump's ""deeply misguided"" policy proposals and what her campaign describes as an out-for-himself approach to business. But she and her aides said she also must make the case for her own agenda.
""All of my plans are focused on a single, overarching goal,"" she said in the interview. ""Creating good paying jobs with rising incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time. And I believe so strongly that Americans deserve and need a raise, and every one of my policies adds up to an agenda to make that happen.""
Mrs. Clinton has struggled to win support from white, working-class voters, while Mr. Trump has found success with that demographic.
Many surveys have shown voters think Mr. Trump would do a better job on economic issues, and a recent CBS News poll found that the presumptive nominees were running even on the question of who would do a better job handling the economy and jobs.
Mr. Trump said in the interview that Mrs. Clinton wouldn't bring jobs back and suggested she was unqualified to handle the economy because her husband, Bill Clinton, as president signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump called ""one of the worst bills in history.""
Mrs. Clinton has rolled out a long list of policy proposals, including infrastructure investment, capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, increasing federal investment in child care, providing paid family leave and making college more affordable.

Election 2016: Clinton's Policy Flurry Blurs Message,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799137741?accountid=12768,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- If there's a problem somewhere in America, Hillary Clinton seems to have a plan to solve it.
Yet a paradox remains: For her dozens of proposals over the course of the presidential race -- from creating cleaner air to dictating the drug emergency responders should use for opioid overdoses -- many voters still don't have a fix on the top priorities she would set in her first months in office, some Democratic strategists and officials say.
Anyone following the presidential race knows that Donald Trump wants to build a border wall and Bernie Sanders wants to wipe out tuition at public colleges.
But Mrs. Clinton has struggled to get across the concrete plans that would be her central focus. That could prove a handicap if she wins. Without a public mandate for their agenda, presidents lose leverage with congressional leaders.
Even a simple slogan encapsulating the Clinton message has been tough to pin down. At a rallyon Wednesday in North Carolina, signs throughout the hall touted the message ""Stronger Together."" Earlier in the race her theme was ""breaking every barrier."" And then there is ""I'm With Her,"" a phrase on campaign buttons.
One person close to the campaign said the slogan could change again before the election in November.
Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist, led focus groups during the primary race and found that while voters liked Mrs. Clinton's experience, they were hard-pressed to say what she wanted to do on the job.
""They loved that she was knowledgeable and qualified to be president. They still hadn't heard the message about where she wanted to take the country,"" Mr. Kofinis said.
Mrs. Clinton's campaign concedes she needs something of a reboot when it comes to laying out her economic agenda. Too many voters are unclear on how she would help them cope with stagnant wages and limited job prospects, a senior campaign aide said.
She sought to fill in those gaps this week, giving a speech in North Carolina meant to explain to a general election audience what sort of economy she values. Yet the broad message had a familiar ring and didn't provide much clarity.
""I have a clear vision of the economy and it's this: We need to make sure our economy works for everyone,"" said the presumptive Democratic nominee.
Gary Hart, a former Colorado senator who ran for the Democratic nomination in 1984 and again in '88, said Mrs. Clinton hews to a centrist approach that tends to ""blur distinctions"" rather than reveal the candidate's core beliefs. ""She's put out a lot of policies and programs, but what's lacking is a statement of principles -- that's what centrists don't want to do,"" he said.
The sheer scale of Mrs. Clinton's proposals has muddied her message, said Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary during Bill Clinton's presidency.
Since entering the race 14 months ago, she has rolled out plans that would offer tax credits for caring for aging parents; protect horses from specific abuses; speed up the internet in rural areas; cure Alzheimer's disease; and penalize companies trying to escape U.S. taxes by merging with foreign firms.
""One of the problems she faces is that while her policy agenda is respectable and well thought-out and covers the waterfront -- the problem is it covers the waterfront,"" Mr. Reich said. ""It's too piecemeal to be memorable.""

Election 2016: Trump Questions Clinton's Faith,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798613424?accountid=12768,"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump questioned Democrat Hillary Clinton's religious faith while affirming his own at a private gathering of hundreds of conservative evangelicals in New York on Tuesday.
Mr. Trump's overture to the religious right came one day after he fired his campaign manager and reported raising tens of millions of dollars less than Mrs. Clinton, heightening concerns in the GOP political establishment about his readiness for the general election.
The religious leaders are potential officers in a grass-roots Trump army in November. But when eight of the event's organizers were asked whether they would endorse him, none raised their hands, though they said he made progress in earning support.
In a meeting earlier Tuesday with a few dozen people who arranged the event, Mr. Trump suggested Mrs. Clinton's religious faith was some sort of a mystery. The former secretary of state and New York senator is a Methodist.
""We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion,"" Mr. Trump said, according to video posted on Twitter by one of the organizers, Christian minister E. W. Jackson. He confirmed the video's authenticity in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
""Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no -- there's nothing out there,"" Mr. Trump told the group. ""It's going to be an extension of Obama, but it's going to be worse, because with Obama you had your guard up; with Hillary, you don't, and it's going to be worse.""
In the run-up to the 2012 election, Mr. Trump incorrectly suggested Mr. Obama was a Muslim and wasn't a U.S. citizen.
In response to Mr. Trump's remarks, the Clinton campaign released a statement of support from evangelical leader Deborah Fikes. ""She lives the Golden Rule in her private life and in her public policies,"" she said. ""Hillary Clinton is the leader who people of faith are looking for, and we are praying that Sister Hillary and not Mr. Trump will be elected in November.""

Election 2016: Clinton Hits Rival's Economic Proposals,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798613337?accountid=12768,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump's economic policies and private-sector practices reckless and wrongheaded, and warned Tuesday that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee could ""bankrupt"" the country if elected.
Mrs. Clinton also sought to undercut Mr. Trump's argument that his business acumen would be a boon for the economy. She cast the New York real-estate developer as an unscrupulous deal maker who has profited at others' expense.
She listed Trump products made in other countries -- including ties made in China and picture frames in India -- and said Mr. Trump profited as many of his businesses failed.
""In America, we don't begrudge people being successful, but we know they shouldn't do it by destroying other people's dreams,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""We can't let him bankrupt America like we are one of his failed casinos.""
In a 45-minute address, the presumptive Democratic nominee also said Mr. Trump's tax plan would give trillions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy while running up the national debt.
""Of course, Donald himself would get a huge tax cut from his own plan,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""But we don't know exactly how much because he won't release his tax returns.""
Mr. Trump counterpunched in real time, tweeting responses while Mrs. Clinton delivered her remarks. He deemed the Democratic candidate ""corrupt, dangerous and dishonest."" And while Mrs. Clinton derided Mr. Trump's past claim that he's ""the king of debt,"" he responded that he would employ a different strategy as president.
""I am 'the king of debt,' "" Mr. Trump said on Twitter. ""That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.""
Mr. Trump said he would discuss Mrs. Clinton's ""failed policies and bad judgment"" in a speech Wednesday.
Economic issues have been an area of relative strength for Mr. Trump, with many polls showing voters divided on the question of which presidential candidate would do a better job handling the economy.
Mr. Trump has pledged to lower tax rates across the board and limit some deductions, but he has offered fewer policy specifics. A person close to the Trump campaign said the Republican candidate would offer additional details about his economic policies, including his tax plan, in the coming weeks.
Mrs. Clinton cited a new Moody's Analytics report which concluded that full adoption of Mr. Trump's economic proposals could cause a prolonged recession and significant job losses. The report's lead author, economist Mark Zandi, advised Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and has donated to Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
The former secretary of state has released a number of policy proposals, including plans for increasing infrastructure investment, capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, increasing federal investment in child care, providing paid family leave and making college more affordable.
Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday that voters shouldn't believe claims from Mr. Trump that he has changed or that he's not simply out for himself.
""He makes over-the-top promises that if people stick with him, trust him, listen to him, put their faith in him -- he'll deliver for them,"" she said. ""He'll make them wildly successful. And then everything falls apart, and people get hurt.""

"Clinton, Obama, Trump and the Abuse of Power",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798612528?accountid=12768,"The authors of a widely quoted study finding that political conservatism is correlated with an authoritarian personality have announced a correction. Turns out their article in the American Journal of Political Science reported their findings exactly backward. The academics now tell us that views on the left side of the political spectrum correlate with authoritarian traits. Political pundits should consider running similar corrections regarding Donald Trump.
It has been this year's most popular media cliche: casting the likely Republican presidential nominee as an aspiring tyrant who will trash constitutional norms in his unending quest for power. Political seers from Georgetown to Manhattan claim to hear in Mr. Trump's words disturbing echoes of the 1930s. Columnists forecast a dark chapter of authoritarian rule in the U.S. should he be elected.
But Mr. Trump isn't that bad. America isn't that fragile. And for anyone concerned about Washington tyranny, there are larger threats -- Hillary Clinton, for one -- that deserve attention.
Mr. Trump has been under fire lately for the temporary ban on Muslim immigrants that he proposed last year. Last week he seemed to refine the proposal, saying the U.S. should screen for terrorist links and also promising, ""I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats."" Like many Americans, I think the better course is to destroy Islamic State while also welcoming newcomers. But there's nothing authoritarian about trying to persuade voters that the country should amend its immigration policies.
President Obama clearly knows this, because he spent much of his anti-Trump rant last week criticizing -- not the temporary ban advanced by Mr. Trump -- but abuses against American citizens that Mr. Obama imagines will result from the Trump agenda.
Yet Americans don't have to imagine the abuses of the Obama administration. Mr. Obama falsely claimed the power to determine when Congress is in recess. He asserted the ability to waive immigration law for millions of people. Does using the IRS against philosophical opponents count as authoritarian?
No evidence has been uncovered tying Mr. Obama to the IRS targeting scandal. But since he proclaimed that it involved ""not even a smidgen of corruption"" long before his government had finished investigating, and has made no serious effort to reform the agency, he now bears some responsibility.
Mr. Trump has made inappropriate or mean-spirited remarks about all kinds of people. But does this mean he's marching the U.S. toward Nuremberg? For the pundits who claim to worry, let's hunt for similarities between Donald Trump and the dictators so much on the minds of media folk.
One trait that ties Donald Trump to some of recent history's most significant authoritarians is that they achieved many of their goals as relatively young men. While in their 30s, Hitler took over what would become known as the Nazi party, Fidel Castro overthrew the Cuban government, Mussolini created the Fascist movement in Italy and Mr. Trump purchased the property on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th that would become Trump Tower, a mix of luxury retail, office space and residential condos.
By his early 60s Stalin had killed millions of his countrymen. At the same age, Mr. Trump had already offered a signature collection of shirts, ties, cuff links, eyewear and leather goods. He has also peddled furniture, mattresses, bedding, lighting, home decor and more. Did Stalin ever have his own fragrance?
Mr. Trump has produced plenty of failures, but they occurred in the world of commerce, where customers get to decide whether a venture and its leader succeed. Authoritarians wouldn't know much about that.
The rule of law and the honest, open government that Americans cherish, and that allow them to make their own choices, are always threatened by those who seek dominion over free people. But the U.S. has more than two centuries of constitutional order on its side. Despite differences and evolving views on many issues, Americans still love freedom. And thanks to its liberal political leanings, the free press will be a much more reliable check on a President Trump than it has been on Mr. Obama or would be on another President Clinton.
The facts suggest that Mrs. Clinton is more likely to abuse liberties than Mr. Trump. Only one candidate in this election cycle has run for president while refusing to cooperate with a federal investigation into her conduct in a previous office. Only one candidate is on record opposing the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Only one candidate condemns the Supreme Court for allowing a movie critical of her to be distributed and advertised.
Besides seeking to silence critics, another hallmark of authoritarians is that they abhor honest, fair elections. Mr. Trump, unlike the Democratic National Committee of the Bill Clinton era, has never had to return more than $1 million in donations because they were tied to foreign sources and likely illegal.
America managed to survive Mr. Clinton's two terms, so it can stand the far less vulgar Mr. Trump. The question is how long it can survive if it elects presidents with a record of opposing constitutional rule of law.

Clinton Drug Plan's Minor Side Effects,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1816293200?accountid=12768,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Hillary Clinton is taking aim at the drug industry, but pharma investors mostly can breathe a sigh of relief.
The presidential candidate unveiled a new plan Friday to combat high prices in the wake of the latest controversy surrounding the EpiPen. Her plan would allow government officials to impose penalties for ""unjustified"" price increases on older treatments without patent protection. The plan also would cap some patients' monthly and annual out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. Extra funding would be on tap for the Food and Drug Administration to help approve generic-drug applications more quickly.
At first blush, this is scary talk for investors. Any action to curb price rises on older drugs would hurt manufacturers that rely on them to generate growth. But their share prices already have taken a beating over the past year.
In addition, the plan offers familiar solutions such as enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices and eliminating tax deductions for advertisements directed at patients. Those policies, if enacted, would have a more comprehensively negative effect on the industry.
Yet a closer look suggests that scenario is unlikely to come to pass. For instance, Mrs. Clinton's plan notes the need to ""ensure that there are proper incentives for real innovations that bring effective products to market.""
That is good news for development-stage biotech companies, for instance, which need the possibility of large profits down the road to attract capital and fund research. And of course, investors are by now aware that a gulf can exist between words and actions in Washington. The harsher aspects, such as a panel to review the fairness of drug pricing or a change to Medicare negotiating policy, would likely need congressional approval. The divided state of American politics lowers the chances this plan would pass muster in its current form.
Criticism of big pharma isn't going away any time soon. But harsh words alone are unlikely to sting investors any further.

"Stocks Rally, Even as Drugmakers Falter --- A new drug-pricing proposal from Clinton dents biotech shares; gold and oil advance",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1816293081?accountid=12768,"U.S. stocks rose, even as declines by drugmakers cut into the broader market's advance.
Shares of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies fell after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton unveiled a new drug-pricing plan that would let government officials impose penalties for ""unjustified price increases"" on older treatments.
The moves served as a reminder that news unrelated to the Federal Reserve still matter to markets.
Stocks, bonds and even the dollar have been locked in a fairly narrow trading range and volumes have dropped off sharply. Both implied and realized volatility have plumbed their lowest levels in months, which many traders have blamed on uncertainty about the next moves by the Fed.
Many traders expected Friday's jobs report, the last broad reading of the labor market before the Fed's September meeting, to spark stock-market swings, but that wasn't the case. In morning trading, major stock indexes rose following a slightly softer-than-expected August jobs report. Declines in health-care stocks caused indexes to pare gains in the afternoon.
The Nasdaq Biotechnology index declined 0.2%, while health-care companies gained the least in the S&P 500, rising less than 0.1%.
Shares of EpiPen maker Mylan, a company at the heart of the drug-pricing debate, fell $1.95, or 4.7%, to $39.97.
The S&P 500 ended the day up 9.12 points, or 0.4%, at 2179.98 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 72.66, or 0.4%, to 18491.96. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 22.69, or 0.4%, to 5249.90.
For the week, the S&P 500 and Dow both rose 0.5%; the Nasdaq rose 0.6%.
Fed officials, including Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer, have signaled in recent speeches that interest rates may be on an upward trend in the near future as long as economic data cooperates.
That has called into question some of the most popular, yield-chasing trades of 2016. Utilities, one of the best-performing S&P 500 sectors this year, fell more than 6% in August. Financial stocks have rallied in recent weeks on hopes for higher rates, which can boost bank profitability.
Friday's jobs data weren't decisive enough to spark substantial buying or selling of these interest-rate-sensitive trades, traders said.
The KBW Nasdaq Bank index, which is up about 8.5% from a month ago, rose 0.5%. Utility companies in the S&P 500 also gained, up 1.2%.
Some traders said they aren't taking the fewer-than-expected jobs gains at face value, and instead they are discounting them in order to take into account the so-called August curse. Historically, the August jobs report has been a seasonally weak and volatile one, and it is often revised substantially higher.
Investors largely expect the next U.S. interest-rate rise to take place by December. The odds of an increase by December, as measured by the fed-funds-futures market, remained steady compared with before the jobs report was released at more than 50%.
Gold rose 0.8% Friday to $1,322.10 an ounce.
The dollar weakened initially before reversing to be higher against most major currencies in late New York trading.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the value of a basket of 16 currencies, gained 0.1%.
The Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 2% following a mixed session in Asia.
Shares in Australia fell 0.8% to a seven-week low, while markets in Japan closed little changed.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.5% to its highest close this year.
U.S.-traded crude oil rose 3% to $44.44 a barrel, snapping a four-session losing streak after Russia signaled support for a limit on output.

"The Many Paradoxes of the Front-Runner, Hillary Clinton; Democrat holds many advantages but also obstacles as the presidential campaign kicks into the final gear",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1816669579?accountid=12768,"Here's one way to look at Hillary Clinton: She's the most highly qualified presidential candidate in years, versed in domestic as well as foreign policy, a centrist who can claim the ability to break gridlock because she has navigated the executive branch as well as both sides of the aisle in the legislative branch.
Here's another way to look at Hillary Clinton: She is the worst possible candidate for this year, the very embodiment of the political establishment that many voters despise, a slippery and secretive insider in a year when people are seeking authenticity and truth-telling above all else.
In fact, both are plausible ways of seeing the Democratic nominee, the person who, at the traditional start of the fall general-election stretch run, stands the best chance to be the next U.S. president.
She is, in short, a study in paradoxes.
She is one of the best-known people in America. In the latest national survey by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News, not a single person who answered the survey said they didn't know enough about her to have an opinion. Only 10% said their feelings about her are neutral. Almost everybody has an opinion about Hillary Clinton.
Yet for a figure so remarkably well known, she is in many ways an enigma. She once was seen as the very embodiment of a Vietnam-era liberal, both by those who liked that idea and those who loathed it. In the 1990s, centrist Democrats as well as conservative Republicans feared she would pull her moderate, triangulating husband relentlessly to the left. A main piece of their evidence was a comprehensive health-care reform plan she helped produce during Bill Clinton's first term as president.
Yet in 2016 she has been attacked from that same left wing as a dyed-in-the-wool centrist who favors weak half-measures rather than full-throated progressive ideas--and a main piece of evidence has been her unwillingness to adopt a more aggressive liberal health-care plan.
She is a pioneering woman at the upper reaches of government, yet she arrived as a presidential nominee just when some women, especially younger women, appear to have stopped thinking that is such big deal.
She is despised by many Republicans, yet gets high marks from some of the Republicans who have worked with her most closely, her former colleagues in the U.S. Senate.
She has more painful experience than anyone--except perhaps her husband--in learning that it's usually futile to try to keep documents and records out of the hands of inquisitive lawyers and congressional committees. Yet she constructed a private email system that appeared to many to be an attempt to accomplish exactly that.
In private, she can be relaxed, gregarious and funny. Yet she is seen to many in the public arena as uptight, tightly controlled and sometimes confrontational. She has been dealing with the national media for a quarter of a century, yet often goes to great lengths to avoid interaction with reporters.
She once had a famously strained relationship with Barack Obama, yet her campaign is counting on the president's full and enthusiastic support to help carry her to victory this fall--and all signs are that she will get it.
Perhaps most surprising, for all the attention and scrutiny she attracts, she now finds herself opposing a Republican nominee, Donald Trump, who has shown an unerring ability to steal the spotlight from even a figure as closely watched and as controversial as Mrs. Clinton.
Roll all the contradictions together, and the Clinton campaign faces what might seem like an odd challenge in the next two months: It may need to reintroduce its extremely well-known candidate to a voting public that holds nearly as jaundiced a view of her as it does of her controversy-generating opponent. Can it make her seem more human, more honest, more relaxed, less defensive--and yes, more likable?
Campaign aides say the tenor of the campaign will change in coming days. Her interactions with the media will expand and improve, they say. Aides maintain they aren't worried about Mr. Trump's proven ability to steal the spotlight. ""He's dominated the news by revealing in particular to swing voters and Main Street voters he's unfit to be president of the United States,"" says Clinton pollster and strategic adviser Joel Benenson.
Mrs. Clinton holds many advantages, including the fact that she has in the past proven an adept debater. That's a crucial skill for the three potentially decisive head-to-head encounters coming up in the weeks ahead. But she also faces significant obstacles, including the ultimate paradox: In another year she might be cruising to victory against a candidate of Mr. Trump's style and experience level. But 2016 isn't another year at all. Anything is possible.

The Way Trump Talks; Clinton's 'reliable' political language may lose to the 'intemperance' of Trumpian rhetoric.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1817403455?accountid=12768,"Until recently, American politics was as flat as a backyard swimming pool. This year, the politicians gathered for their quadrennial family cookout, known as the presidential primaries. Suddenly, everyone saw some big old blond guy in red trunks bouncing on the diving board. Uh-oh. Then the big guy launched himself, butt first, into the middle of the pool. Everyone, and I mean everyone, got soaked.
Uncle Don, the uninvited guest at the 2016 election, has upended almost everything we knew about presidential campaigns. Not least is the way Donald Trump talks.
""I would build a great wall. And nobody builds walls better than me, believe me. And I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I'll have Mexico pay for that wall.""
""Get 'em out of here. That's right. Get 'em out of here.""
Nobody in politics talks like that. It violates what we now call ""the political discourse.""
For years, politicians have been oh-so careful with their words. In part, this is the language of constituencies and coalition-building, the constant calibrating of support.
But it is also because in our time the media has made politicians pay a price for saying anything that risks harming this or that collection of political sensibilities. When Hillary Clinton said, ""I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation,"" the press said she had disrespected Native Americans.
It's ridiculous, but real. No straighter jacket exists in politics today than language. Marco Rubio, an articulate and often forceful speaker, is careful not to push too far beyond the spin zone.
There is also the fact-checking mania. PolitiFact got a Pulitzer Prize in 2009 for its microscopic fact-checks . . . and the politicians went to ground. Scrupulous exactitude in politics may be a good thing, but it's also dull.
A century or more ago, ""intemperate"" wasn't in the political vocabulary. Compared with Teddy Roosevelt, Donald Trump is Little Bo-Peep. The historian William Leuchtenburg writes that Roosevelt once attacked the Colombians as this ""pithecoid community"" of ""Dagos"" and ""homicidal corruptionists.""
Possibly we are better off without TR's red-faced eruptions. The problem today is that fear of offending or losing votes has so blanded out the political class that many of these politicians and the American electorate are no longer speaking the same language.
Into this void flopped a couple of rhetorical throwbacks--Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Though both lacked eloquence, people everywhere responded to their blunt language, to the point of being oblivious to its content. It was the way they talked that connected with voters. Messrs. Trump and Sanders liberated their audiences from normal politics, because normal politics had become suspect.
Some argued that Mr. Trump merely tapped into latent anger at political correctness. But Bernie embodied PC. Something else in the culture elevated this new political language.
It isn't exactly truth-telling, because so much of what these two said remained obscure. Liberal critics pointed out that Bernie's spending was essentially limitless. The Trump wall, like Jack's beanstalk, kept getting bigger. It didn't matter. It seemed--or sounded--so real.
Many people today think food isn't real unless the label tells them it is organic or artisanal. TV commercials announce, ""Not actors, real people."" Politics has no immunity from these new interpretations of what's real. Just the feeling of authenticity for many has become more powerful than understanding the grubby realities of political limits.
Many voters don't want to hear established politicians talking about the political process, as Mrs. Clinton is doing now, endlessly. What they want is a fighter, a valiant gesture. The Trump and Sanders detractors thought they were hearing a fascist or a socialist wingnut. Their supporters were hearing Sir Galahad, a knight to the rescue.
The political language of a Trump or Sanders also became a kind of shared code of entry. Only individuals able to speak the new language among themselves could ""get it."" The discussions of illegal immigration and income inequality go on inside a kind of impenetrable regional dialect, like the way Donald Trump says China--""Chiiii-nuh!""
Hillary Clinton is the antithesis of the current need. Every word she speaks, because it is so carefully planned, rings instantly false. Even the true ones.
Still, the now-evident limitation of this new emotive political language is that none of its speakers or hearers knows what to do next. What comes after the words remains an unchartered frontier.
Bernie Sanders fell short. The current Trump campaign looks like a game of Twister, covering the blank spots. Even the Clinton camp is wrestling with two words--honest and trustworthy.
In the suddenly tightening presidential race, we are seeing, or hearing, the careful and ""reliable"" political language of Hillary Clinton in competition with the intemperance of Trumpian rhetoric. One sounds real, the other just doesn't. The new way of talking in American politics may turn out to be enough to win.

"Election 2016: Some Business Leaders Abandon GOP --- Clinton to get backing from executives, some of whom cite unease with Trump candidacy",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798955462?accountid=12768,"More than 50 business executives, including several longtime Republicans, will endorse Hillary Clinton for president on Thursday as her campaign seeks to capitalize on discomfort with Republican Donald Trump.
They include Jim Cicconi, senior executive vice president at AT&T Services Inc., and Dan Akerson, who held top positions at General Motors Co. and Nextel Communications Inc. A Clinton campaign aide provided the list and said it would be distributed widely on Thursday.
The endorsements reflect continuing unease among some Republicans with the presumptive GOP presidential nominee despite his romp through the primary contest.
Mr. Cicconi, who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said he has backed every GOP presidential candidate since 1976. ""But this year I think it's vital to put our country's well being ahead of party,"" he said. ""Hillary Clinton is experienced, qualified, and will make a fine president. The alternative, I fear, would set our nation on a very dark path.""
Mr. Akerson said he has consistently voted for Republicans for president in the past but couldn't support Mr. Trump. ""Serving as the leader of the free world requires effective leadership, sound judgment, a steady hand and most importantly, the temperament to deal with crises large and small. Donald Trump lacks each of these characteristics,"" said Mr. Akerson, who also served as a Navy surface warfare officer.
On Wednesday, Brent Scowcroft, a national security adviser for two Republican presidents, endorsed Mrs. Clinton, saying her experience, judgment and understanding of the world prepare her for the job of commander in chief. His support comes a week after Richard Armitage, another longtime Republican foreign-policy hand, said he would back Mrs. Clinton if, as expected, Mr. Trump is the GOP nominee.
After a slow start, Mr. Trump is racing to shore up his standing with his party's establishment and in recent weeks has been making overtures to top GOP donors, many of whom supported others in the primaries and haven't been quick to warm to him.
Mr. Trump attended a fundraiser at Le Cirque in New York City on Tuesday, attended by hedge-fund manager John Paulson, who had backed four of his rivals during the Republican primaries.
He also attended a breakfast Wednesday at Cipriani in Midtown, co-hosted by New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, a billionaire who had supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Last week, Mr. Trump raised money in Texas, meeting with several of his party's wealthiest donors.
After a low fundraising haul in May, Mr. Trump has raised at least $19 million for his joint fund with the Republican National Committee in recent weeks and about $3 million for his campaign, people familiar with the matter said.
Senior Clinton policy adviser Jake Sullivan briefed several of her supporters from the business community on a conference call Wednesday, during which he outlined the economic agenda she laid out in a pair of speeches this week, as well as her critique of Mr. Trump's record and policies.
The list of business leaders backing her includes several who have supported Democrats in the past, including Eric Schmidt of Alphabet Inc., Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook Inc., and Warren Buffett of Berkshire-Hathaway, Inc.
Others endorsing the former secretary of state include Hollywood-turned-internet executive Barry Diller of IAC/InterActiveCorp; Hollywood executive Peter Chernin, of The Chernin Group; Wendell Weeks of Corning Inc.; Reed Hastings of Netflix Inc.; and Rob Marcus, formerly of Time Warner Inc.

"Election 2016: Trump, Clinton Exchange Barbs in Speeches",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798937554?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump uncorked a series of blistering attacks on Democrat Hillary Clinton on Wednesday as the Republican seeks to regain his footing in the presidential race, calling her ""the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.""
Speaking a short time later in North Carolina, which is likely to be a battleground state this fall, Mrs. Clinton veered from a planned speech about the economy to rebut his volley of attacks and make a rare defense of the work of the Clinton Foundation.
She sought to explain Mr. Trump's focus on her character and career as a tactic meant to divert attention from what she described as his own lack of policy plans. ""He has no real strategy for creating jobs -- just a string of empty promises,"" she said. ""And maybe we shouldn't expect better from someone whose most famous words are, 'You're fired.'""
Mr. Trump, in one of his first major addresses of the general election, accused Mrs. Clinton of using her post as secretary of State during President Barack Obama's first term to enrich herself.
He also said her policies destabilized the Middle East and North Africa, and that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, accepted speaking fees and contributions to their family's charitable foundation from Wall Street and foreign governments.
""Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft,"" Mr. Trump told an audience of about 100 people at a New York hotel bearing his name. ""She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others . . . in exchange for cash, pure and simple.""
Asked for response, Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said Mr. Trump was offering ""lies and nutty conspiracy theories"" to distract from economic policies that, he said, would cause a recession. ""Donald Trump continues to prove that he is unqualified and unfit to be president,"" he said.
Mrs. Clinton included several references to her Methodist faith in her speech, a day after Mr. Trump told a group of social conservatives that ""we don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion."" ""All he can do is try to distract us. That's even why he's attacking my faith,"" she said.
Mr. Trump's remarks marked his campaign's latest attempt to show that he can unify a Republican Party that is increasingly worried about his comportment, his small campaign organization and an embryonic finance team that has lagged far behind Mrs. Clinton's fundraising efforts.
His speech echoed themes and phrases used for months by one of his top policy aides, Stephen Miller, in introducing Mr. Trump to crowds at rallies across the country.
Mr. Trump didn't mention one of his campaign's most provocative proposals: a ban on Muslim immigrants entering the country, which he first offered in December after the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings and restated last week after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump twice mentioned the threat that terrorists pose to ""peaceful Muslims"" and focused on blocking Syrian refugees who haven't been properly vetted.
But the thrust of his speech was aimed at Mrs. Clinton, one day after she delivered a speech claiming Mr. Trump would ""bankrupt"" the U.S. economy.
Mr. Trump blamed the former secretary of State for the deaths of four Americans in the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, and said that her foreign policies helped Islamic State rise to power.
""Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched,"" Mr. Trump said. ""In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.""
Clinton campaign aides expect Mr. Trump to continue to target her personally in the course of the campaign and said she would be selective in how she responds, in an effort to avoid trading insults continually with Mr. Trump.
In another sign that Mr. Trump's campaign is making adjustments, a newly revved-up press operation fired off one attack after another during Mrs. Clinton's speechon Tuesday, in which she bashed Mr. Trump's potential stewardship of the economy. The Trump campaign also announced four new staff hires, including a national political director and digital media director. It said it was launching an anti-Clinton website ""to showcase some of Mrs. Clinton's most disastrous lies to the American people.""

Clinton's Stealthy Single-Payer Gambit; The 'public option' could be implemented around the country--without congressional approval.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1818953950?accountid=12768,"It looks like 2017 will be ObamaCare's worst year yet. The three major insurers, along with many smaller plans, are largely exiting the health-insurance exchanges, leaving more than half of U.S. counties with only one or two health-plan choices, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . Nearly 36% of ObamaCare regions may have only one participating insurance carrier offering plans for 2017, according to health-care analytics firm Avalere Health. Data from analysts at Barclays and Credit Suisse project that health-insurance premiums are expected to rise at least 24% in 2017.
To rescue President Obama's health-care law, Hillary Clinton has proposed resurrecting the ""public option."" This failed idea--a government-run health-care plan to compete with private insurers--can't save ObamaCare. But introducing it across the country would move the U.S. much closer to the single-payer system progressives have always longed for.
Mrs. Clinton positions the states as vehicles for the public option, and this isn't because she discovered a late-in-life appreciation for federalism. Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act, a little-known provision, allows states to renounce almost all of ObamaCare's dictates. That includes the law's politically sacred rules governing the medical benefits consumers are promised and the subsidy structure that helps pay for them. States only need to develop alternative schemes that can achieve the same level of similarly priced coverage that they would attain under ordinary ObamaCare.
In 2011 Vermont tried to use this waiver process to introduce a public option, only to abandon it three years later when it became clear that the scheme would yield skyrocketing taxes on small businesses. Minnesota, Maine and Rhode Island are proposing variations of this scheme for implementation after 2017. Maine's proposed law boasts of its intent to use ""federal funds to the maximum extent allowable under federal law."" Colorado is using the 1332 waiver to pursue its own single payer through an initiative on the ballot this November.
The real juice is the funding. To pay for these schemes, the 1332 waivers let states pocket the aggregate subsidies--including premium tax credits, cost-sharing subsidies, and small-business tax credits--that they would otherwise receive under ObamaCare. This federal slush fund could give states billions of dollars annually to subsidize their own publicly run health plan.
The process gives the executive branch broad authority to coax or even coerce states to pursue the creation of these public options--without congressional consent. ObamaCare requires that any new scheme be ""deficit neutral"" relative to the cost of the law. So long as the new public option won't add to ObamaCare's costs, the state can use the law's subsidies to pay for government-run plans. The waivers give states ample ability to use savings claimed by setting price controls on medical care as a way to meet the budget goals.
Federal regulators would approve new public options based on White House budget office estimates of the program's cost and impact on a state's existing insurance market. The Obama administration has abused this broad discretion before: Officials manipulated ""budget neutrality"" by allowing states like Arkansas to expand their Medicaid programs under ObamaCare.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2014 criticized the Obama administration over its ""lack of transparency in the basis for approved spending limits"" and ""assurances that demonstrations would be budget-neutral to the federal government."" It is hard to imagine that a Clinton White House would be any more responsible.
Minnesota provides an example for how this might work. The state already pushes Medicaid enrollees into one of the state-directed Medicaid HMOs. Under one of the state's new proposals, it could use the 1332 waiver to market similar low-cost plans on the ObamaCare exchange. The Minnesota scheme could use the state's existing Medicaid price schedule to set provider rates under this public option.
Forcing providers to accept Medicaid-like rates could make these state-run public options an ostensibly cheaper alternative to the current ObamaCare plans. The end result? A federally subsidized, single-payer health-care system run by the states--complete with government authority to set prices. These government plans would have so many competitive advantages through federal subsidies and price setting that they would force the private plans out of the exchange market.
ObamaCare used the law's vast authority to get control over the design and composition of health benefits. ClintonCare will try to use these same administrative riggings to get power over the pricing of these products and services. After moderate Democrats came out against the public option, it seemed like it would never be ushered into law. Yet the policy doesn't need congressional approval. Mrs. Clinton apparently understands the law's vices better than those who voted for it.

"No Value Added in Wealth Advisory? Yale's Class of 1954 Might Not Agree; Essex Investment's Joe McNay helped alumni group turn $70,000 into more than $65 million; counseling the Clintons",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1819982027?accountid=12768,"Barely a year out of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, Joe McNay was working in Boston as an analyst for Old Colony Trust Co. He spotted Syntex Corp., a drug maker seeking regulatory approval for a birth-control pill, and persuaded his employer to buy 1 million shares.
Old Colony acquired shares at $17 each and--get up, get outta here--sold them six months later at $600 apiece, about 35 times the original investment.
The year was 1961. Mr. McNay has been picking winners ever since.
Today, he is the chairman of Essex Investment Management Co., a Boston registered investment adviser that manages about $643 million in assets, primarily for high-net-worth investors.
""It's so much more interesting doing what we're doing than sitting on beach,"" says Mr. McNay, a gifted raconteur who enjoys retelling some of the great stories from his career. Like why the Yale University class of 1954 was so happy at its 50th reunion. Or what it was like to manage money for Bill and Hillary Clinton.
Here's the real story. Inside wealth management, a growing herd of asset-gathering sheep dismiss investment management as a commodity. They say, no value added, money-management fees are going to zero. I say, not so fast. Mr. McNay's career, 55 years and going strong, underscores the importance of deep investment expertise. It wins clients. It instills confidence. It proves that financial professionals know what they are doing no matter what the markets bring.
Yale's Class of 1954
After the Syntex win, Mr. McNay left Old Colony and continued building his reputation as an institutional money manager. Two firms. More success. In 1976 he founded Essex, where he managed money for both high-net-worth investors as well as institutions. And it was here, in his own shop, where he landed a quirky assignment that is now legend.
About two years after their 25th reunion, several members from Yale's class of 1954 raised $70,000 and asked Mr. McNay to invest it. (He is a Yale graduate himself, class of 1956.) The twist is that the '54s indicated they would turn the portfolio over to Yale in 2004 as part of the 50th Reunion gift. From 1981 through 1984, other classmates contributed about $305,000 in additional funds.
By 2000, the portfolio had grown to $65 million, an annualized return under Mr. McNay's direction of 34% by some estimates. And in what appears to have been a prescient move given the bear markets that followed, the '54s agreed to give the money to Yale early.
But nothing in life is free, and the early gift came with two provisions: the university had to match additional contributions from the class until 2004 and to credit the class with a 10% return on the $65 million until then.
Great horse trading. I estimate the guaranteed 10% return grew the $65 million to about $95 million by 2004. With the match and additional donations, the class of 1954's gift to Yale totaled $114 million at the 50th Reunion. And in the ultimate expression of supremely happy clients, they welcomed Mr. McNay into their ranks by making him an honorary member of the class of 1954.
Presidential Portfolio
Among Mr. McNay's clients were two other Yale alumni. Starting in 1993, he managed money for the Clintons while they were in the White House. The assignment ended in 1998, when Mr. McNay sold two-thirds of Essex to Affiliated Managers Group and resigned the account. (Mr. McNay has since bought back his controlling interest in Essex.)
Forget performance numbers, what were portfolio reviews like with the Clintons?
The Clintons' assets were held in a blind trust, no one was allowed to discuss individual securities, and there were always lots of lawyers, Mr. McNay recalls. He brought one. President and Mrs. Clinton brought one. And a government office of ethics brought one. The three groups discussed only performance results.
At first, this description sounds daunting. Who would want to manage a blind trust for any U.S. president? Upon reflection, however, I doubt there is another situation where you can shrug your shoulders at portfolio losses and say to the client, ""Hey, don't blame me for your recession.""
Investment Expertise
Of course, I asked Mr. McNay what stocks he owns. He says client portfolios typically include 25 to 30 stocks, that he takes positions in companies that profit from change or technological innovation.
Mr. McNay talks about stocks the way the rest of us breathe. We discussed a flurry of companies, among them Cognex Corp.. It is a robotics company that makes vision products, which convert visual information into a format necessary to automate tasks, a good example of both the prospects for change or technological innovation that are hallmarks of his investment style.
I also asked Mr. McNay what to do about fixed income, whether you hold your nose, advise clients to buy short-duration bonds and grumble that low yields are the price of safety. But he says, ""I would not buy a bond now on any basis."" Mr. McNay points to looming interest-rate increases in the U.S., noting the pressure they put on bond prices, which move opposite of yields.
While he acknowledges that rising rates are a worry for stocks, too, his view is that negative real interest rates overseas have turned the dollar into a destination currency. This flow of money is bullish for U.S. stocks and, in general, banks perform well when rates are rising. Whether right or wrong, it is a crystal-clear investment thesis, one that I personally find compelling.
The bigger point
Index-tracking exchange-traded funds are surging in popularity. Algorithm-driven robo advisers are popping up all the time. They make it easy to agree with the asset-gathering sheep, who believe investment management adds no value, that fees are going to zero.
Yet I bet there's at least one class from Yale that would argue otherwise. And the reality is that many clients value investment savvy when the markets are roiling.
Who's better equipped to allay client fears during a market crash: The adviser who routinely attends research meetings or the one who eschews them as a waste and instead focuses exclusively on value-added services like financial planning?
My view: When the bear comes, I hope you're not saying, ""Baa.""

The 'Deplorables' Respond to Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1819678229?accountid=12768,"Regarding your editorial ""Clinton and the 'Deplorables'"" (Sept. 12): From the sarcastic tone of Hillary Clinton's voice when she delivered her scathing comments about the ""deplorables"" (Donald Trump supporters), it was obvious she meant each and every word.

"Election 2016: Clinton Holds Advantage in Latest Poll --- Democrat is ahead of Trump by 5 points, but lead shrinks as field of candidates widens",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799524940?accountid=12768,"After a tumultuous few weeks in the presidential campaign, Democrat Hillary Clinton's lead over Republican rival Donald Trump stands at 5 percentage points, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, but the race is essentially tied when third-party candidates are included.
The latest survey, of 1,000 registered voters, shows Mrs. Clinton gets 46% support, to 41% for Mr. Trump, in a head-to-head matchup. The presumptive Democratic nominee's number has held steady over the past month, while Mr. Trump's standing dropped by 2 points since May.
The survey was conducted June 19-23, a period in which Mr. Trump fired his campaign manager and faced criticism from within his own party over weak fundraising numbers and lack of organization. Earlier in the month, he was the target of bipartisan ire for his focus on a federal judge's ethnicity and his reaction to the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla.
That Mr. Trump's gap with his rival grew by just 2 points after enduring the rockiest phase of his campaign so far is a sign that perceptions of the candidates are hardening, the pollsters said.
""Donald Trump has had the worst month one can imagine, but Clinton's negatives are so high the net impact on the ballot is almost invisible,"" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Democratic pollster Fred Yang.
Mrs. Clinton's lead fell to 1 point, at 39% to Mr. Trump's 38%, when Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are part of the mix. With both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton saddled with low approval ratings, voters seem to be looking for alternatives. Together, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein were the choice of 16% of those who took part in the survey.
A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said the Libertarian ticket expects to be on the ballot in all 50 states. A Green Party spokesman said the party expects to do at least as well as 2012, when Ms. Stein was on the ballot in 37 states.
Mrs. Clinton commanded the support of 78% of those surveyed who backed her rival in the Democratic primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. She and other Democratic allies are trying to get that number to grow by unifying the party coming off an unexpectedly competitive primary race.
One holdout for now is Mr. Sanders himself. Though he said he would vote for Mrs. Clinton, he has withheld his endorsement. Last week, his campaign complained that Clinton allies on a Democratic platform drafting committee didn't take a harder stance against a Pacific free-trade pact that President Barack Obama is pushing.
Mrs. Clinton has held a steady lead in national polling for well over a month, but there have been some signs of tightness in battleground states. A series of polls last week from Quinnipiac University, for instance, found Mr. Clinton commanding a large lead, 47% to 39%, in Florida, but running basically even with Mr. Trump in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Democratic candidates since 1992 have held a distinct edge in the Electoral College, and a win in Florida for Mrs. Clinton would make a victory for Mr. Trump all the harder.
With the general election in the early stages, voters are deeply divided about the two top candidates. Men and women, whites and minorities, city dwellers and rural voters see Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in starkly different terms.
The survey showed a distinct gender split. Mrs. Clinton enjoys a 17-point lead among women, while Mr. Trump has a 10-point advantage among men.
The Clinton campaign has sought to capitalize on what it sees as Mr. Trump's vulnerability among women voters. After Mr. Trump accused Mrs. Clinton of playing the ""woman card"" in April, Mrs. Clinton's campaign launched a fundraising appeal, inviting supporters to purchase their very own pink ""woman card"" suitable for display on refrigerator doors.
Mrs. Clinton's strength is deepest in the cities. She led Mr. Trump by nearly 30 points in urban areas, while Mr. Trump was ahead by about the same margin in rural parts of the country.
The split along racial lines is especially pronounced. Mr. Trump was the choice of only 22% of Hispanic voters, meaning he is running behind the previous Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, who captured 27% of the Hispanic vote in losing to Mr. Obama in 2012.
Mr. Trump has made immigration a focus of his campaign. He has vowed to build a wall on the southern border to prevent illegal immigration. More recently, he has said the federal judge presiding over lawsuits surrounding Trump University has a conflict of interest because of his heritage. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants.
Mrs. Clinton's support among Hispanics stood at 69%.
Overall, Mr. Trump led 49% to 37% among white voters, while Mrs. Clinton led 73% to 16% among nonwhites.

More Clinton Shenanigans in Haiti,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1820545669?accountid=12768,"On Jan. 27, 2011, Clinton Foundation Chief Operating Officer Laura Graham sent an email to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's chief of staff Cheryl Mills, voicing concern about a rumor. Ms. Graham had heard that Foggy Bottom was thinking about revoking the U.S. visa of Haitian Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive. ""Wjc will be v unhappy if that's the case,"" Ms. Graham warned Ms. Mills, using the initials of the former president.
Ms. Graham, who was also chief of staff to Mr. Clinton at the foundation, had other reasons to worry: ""I'm also staying at [Mr. Bellerive's] house fyi so exposure in general and this weekend in particular for wjc on this.""
So Clinton Foundation staff was hobnobbing with a powerful Haitian politician and using connections at the State Department to try to influence U.S. policy decisions involving that same politician. That's unethical and it is also contrary to what Mrs. Clinton promised when she went before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January 2009 as president-elect Barack Obama's secretary of state nominee.
Back then she boasted that the foundation and the incoming administration ""decided to go beyond what the law and the ethics rules call for to address even the appearance of conflict"" of interest with a ""memorandum of understanding"" to ""address potential concerns"" and ensure transparency.
Now a string of State Department emails from January 2011 -- made public through a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, request by Citizens United -- demonstrates that Mrs. Clinton's State Department did not separate itself from the Clinton Foundation but instead collaborated with it.
In her Jan. 27 email Ms. Graham also offered advice: ""Nor do I think u need remove his visa. Not sure what it gets u. Remove elizabeth's and prevals people,"" she wrote, referring to the wife of Haitian President Rene Preval and his staff.
The next publicly available email from Ms. Mills to Ms. Graham reads, ""You also should consider the message it sends to others that you stay at his house."" Ms. Graham shot back that she had ""discussed staying at his house w both u and wjc long ago and was told good strategic value.""
The U.S. did not revoke Mr. Bellerive's visa, and it is not clear whether State contemplated doing so. The U.S. had pulled the visa of another Preval-government minister on electoral fraud allegations under Haitian protests, Mr. Bellerive told me in an email on Saturday. But he said he was never informed by the U.S that his visa was in jeopardy.
Mr. Bellerive was an important Bill Clinton ally. After the January 2010 earthquake, he worked with the State Department and inside the Haitian parliament to pass emergency legislation that created the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC). He and Mr. Clinton became its co-chairmen.
The IHRC handled the contracting of hundreds of millions of dollars from the State Department's U.S. Agency for International Development and from international donors -- with little to show for it as I explained in a May 2014 column. In a December 2010 letter to the IHRC co-chairmen, 12 IHRC commissioners complained that they were never consulted, or even informed about, hiring staff or consultants. Haitians whispered that the lucrative contracts went to the politically connected.
In another email to Ms. Mills, dated Jan. 24, 2011, Ms. Graham expressed the foundation's desire to retain Mr. Bellerive as co-chairman of the IHRC. ""With JMB we are rarely challenged in taking the path we want."" A new co-chairman would mean ""potentially roadblocks in doing what we want/how we want it/etc."" It seems the foundation was running the IHRC and didn't want interference.
Delaware-based VCS Mining announced in a December 2012 press release that it was awarded a permit to mine for gold in northeast Haiti. The release said that it was one of only two gold-mining permits issued by Haiti in 50 years. The permit was suspended in early 2013 because of Haitian Senate objections. According to a March 2015 Washington Post article, Mr. Bellerive said that VCS Mining chief executive Angelo Viard then hired him for $8,000 to help VCS navigate Haitian politics in an effort to win support for the mine.
Clinton Foundation officials confirmed to the Post that Mr. Viard paid $20,000 in 2013 to become a member of the Clinton Global Initiative. That year both Tony Rodham, Mrs. Clinton's brother, and Mr. Bellerive joined the company's advisory board. Mr. Bellerive told the Post that he declined compensation on the board.
My requests last week for comment from VCS went unanswered, but 2015 press reports quote company officials denying any ""quid pro quo concerning the Clinton Foundation."" In March 2016 both Mr. Rodham and Mr. Bellerive resigned their VCS advisory board posts, according to a company press release.
Large parts of these 2011 State Department emails are redacted. But reading between the blank spaces, much is revealed -- and none of it boosts confidence in Mrs. Clinton.

More Clinton Shenanigans in Haiti; Emails show the State Department and the Clinton Foundation collaborated on policy.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1820497863?accountid=12768,"On Jan. 27, 2011, Clinton Foundation Chief Operating Officer Laura Graham sent an email to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's chief of staff Cheryl Mills, voicing concern about a rumor. Ms. Graham had heard that Foggy Bottom was thinking about revoking the U.S. visa of Haitian Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive. ""Wjc will be v unhappy if that's the case,"" Ms. Graham warned Ms. Mills, using the initials of the former president.
Ms. Graham, who was also chief of staff to Mr. Clinton at the foundation, had other reasons to worry: ""I'm also staying at [Mr. Bellerive's] house fyi so exposure in general and this weekend in particular for wjc on this.""
So Clinton Foundation staff was hobnobbing with a powerful Haitian politician and using connections at the State Department to try to influence U.S. policy decisions involving that same politician. That's unethical and it is also contrary to what Mrs. Clinton promised when she went before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January 2009 as president-elect Barack Obama's secretary of state nominee.
Back then she boasted that the foundation and the incoming administration ""decided to go beyond what the law and the ethics rules call for to address even the appearance of conflict"" of interest with a ""memorandum of understanding"" to ""address potential concerns"" and ensure transparency.
Now a string of State Department emails from January 2011--made public through a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, request by Citizens United--demonstrates that Mrs. Clinton's State Department did not separate itself from the Clinton Foundation but instead collaborated with it.
In her Jan. 27 email Ms. Graham also offered advice: ""Nor do I think u need remove his visa. Not sure what it gets u. Remove elizabeth's and prevals people,"" she wrote, referring to the wife of Haitian President Rene Preval and his staff.

Clinton Vows Wider High-Speed Connectivity,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800061514?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton laid out plans aimed at democratizing technology Tuesday, releasing a wide-ranging agenda that calls for connecting every household to high-speed internet, promoting innovation and developing the next generation of entrepreneurs.
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee set an ambitious goal of bringing broadband to every U.S. home by 2020, saying that the benefits of technology should be widely shared. Mrs. Clinton also called for a range of upgrades to the nation's technology infrastructure, including deploying next-generation wireless systems and connecting more public destinations such as airports and train stations to the internet and clearing the way for them to offer free Wi-Fi.
""I intend to make sure we do what we did with electricity in my grandparents' generation--we connect every home and business in America to high-speed internet, and we do it on as fast a time scale as possible,"" Mrs. Clinton said during a campaign stop in Denver. ""Every year we waste means we leave people behind and left out in a way that is heartbreaking and wrong.""
After touring a workforce training facility and small-business incubator, Mrs. Clinton sketched her vision for tech and innovation, saying that the U.S. needs to get back into the ""future business"" while suggesting that Republican Donald Trump is focused on the past.
""Saying that you want to make America 'great again' is code for saying, 'We want to go back to the way it used to be,'"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""'Forget about technology, forget about inclusivity, forget about giving everybody an opportunity to have a real shot at the best possible future.' Well, that is not who we are as Americans. We don't go back--we go forward.""
Mr. Trump has embraced ""Make America Great Again"" as his campaign slogan, and has called for renegotiating trade deals on more favorable terms and boosting economic independence as ways to improve American fortunes.
In a speech Tuesday, Mr. Trump said of the U.S., ""We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free.""
He called for a tougher line with China, repeated his opposition to a pending Asia-Pacific trade pact and said the U.S. should toss out the current North American Free Trade Agreement.
In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, also detailed a new student-loan relief plan aimed at supporting young entrepreneurs and innovators. The former secretary of state would allow many young people starting new ventures to defer payments on their student loans for up to three years, easing a financial burden during the startup phase of their business.
""If you get that enterprise up and going, we want to forgive a portion of your debt because you've become a job creator, and we need more job creators,"" she said.
Her plan also would forgive up to $17,500 in student loans for many innovators who launch businesses in struggling communities or develop social enterprises that deliver a measurable benefit.
""If you get that enterprise up and going, we want to forgive a portion of your debt because you've become a job creator, and we need more job creators,"" Mrs. Clinton said.
The campaign hasn't provided details about how these initiatives would be funded.
Mrs. Clinton's 15-page tech platform touches on a wide range of other issues, including a defense of net neutrality, a call for improving the patent system and a pledge to create a national commission on digital security.
Linda Moore, president and CEO of TechNet, a bipartisan network of technology executives, praised Mrs. Clinton for being the first presidential candidate to offer a technology and innovation agenda.
""In doing so, Hillary proves that she gets it--that our nation's ability to grow our economy and drive job creation is dependent on our ability to stay ahead of the curve in innovation,"" Ms. Moore said. She added, though, that Mrs. Clinton's platform is silent on key issues such as modernizing the tax code.
President Barack Obama has made closing the digital divide a priority during his administration. He pledged to connect 99% of American students to high-speed internet in their schools by 2018, and last year he launched a pilot program to bring broadband to low-income households.
Mrs. Clinton would go further with a plan to connect every household and to provide all students with access to computer-science education by the time they graduate. Her plan also calls for training 50,000 new computer-science education teachers during the next decade.
Tuesday's rollout is the latest in a long list of policy proposals Mrs. Clinton has unveiled. She has released detailed plans for issues ranging from to preventing sexual assaults on campuses, contrasting her itemized agenda with Donald Trump's plans.
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has said that voters don't care about his lack of policy specifics. Mrs. Clinton tells supporters that she has an old-fashioned idea that ""if you're running for president, you should say what you want to do and how you will get it done. ""

Benghazi Report Spreads Blame Widely --- Clinton faces little new criticism in GOP-led panel's account of 2012 attack in Libya,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799982025?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Congressional Republicans' on the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, outlined few new criticisms of Hillary Clinton, highlighting more broadly what it called an array of failings by the Obama administration.
The House Select Committee on Benghazi faulted multiple agencies for lacking an overall Libya strategy, and it characterized the U.S. government as slow and disorganized in responding to the attacks on two diplomatic and intelligence facilities once they were under way. The report largely confirmed the existing story line--that a group of anti-American Libyan militants stormed U.S. installations in a carefully planned assault, killing four Americans, including Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya.
But the document, the last in a series of congressional investigations into the attacks, is likely to provide political fodder as it landed in the middle of a presidential campaign that is focusing in large part on questions of terrorism and security. Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, who was secretary of state at the time of the attacks, has faced intense criticism from Republicans over the episode.
Democrats have charged that the two-year investigation was . Several Republican candidates and organizations used the 2014 creation of the committee in fundraising solicitations. A staffer working for the Republicans on the committee at one point sued, alleging in his legal complaint that the committee's work was partisan, before later dropping the allegation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy last year in a TV interview connected the Benghazi committee to Mrs. Clinton's .
The latest document presented few notable facts not found in earlier investigations by several congressional committees and a State Department review board. It did offer new details and context on why U.S. personnel were in Libya and how decision makers in Washington responded to the unfolding attacks. The report portrayed an administration, especially Mrs. Clinton, looking to showcase the success of the 2011 military intervention in Libya that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi. It found that State Department employees were preparing for Mrs. Clinton to potentially visit Libya in late 2012 and seeking a policy success for her to announce, including potentially the establishment of a permanent U.S. presence in Benghazi.
The report said Mrs. Clinton and top-level State Department officials, including Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy, should have known about concerns that terrorist groups were operating freely in the region.
""The intelligence on which Kennedy and the secretary were briefed daily was clear and pointed--Al Qa'ida, al Qa'ida like groups, and other regional extremists took refuge in the security vacuum created by the Libya government,"" the report found.
The State Department didn't respond regarding Mr. Kennedy's role. But Mrs. Clinton, before the committee last October, said the peril in Libya was widely known.
""We were certainly aware that the situation across Libya was becoming more dangerous, and that there were particular concerns about eastern Libya,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""There was never any recommendation by anyone--the intelligence community, the Defense Department, the State Department officials responsible for Libya--to leave Benghazi.""
Two of the House panel's seven Republican members wrote their own addendum to the report, arguing President Barack Obama's administration misled the public about the nature of the attacks because he was locked in a tight re-election race at the time.
Records uncovered by the committee and released last year show that Mrs. Clinton emailed her daughter, Chelsea, the night of the attack saying it was perpetrated by an al Qaeda-like group. But days later, the Obama administration was saying the protest was the result of a spontaneous protest sparked by an anti-Islamic film that was circulating on the internet.
The committee report found that Obama aide David Plouffe helped prepare Susan Rice the president's national security adviser, for her appearance on five Sunday talk shows the week of the attacks. The committee also said Ms. Rice's spurred by the video caused dissent in the State Department's ranks, with one senior official writing in an email that she was ""off the reservation on this one.""
Mrs. Clinton told the committee last October that she was careful in how the State Department statement at the time was worded, emphasizing that it made clear that ""some"" have sought to justify the attacks as a response to the offensive video.
The five Democrats on the panel released their own report Monday, arguing, as they have repeatedly, that the investigation was motivated by a partisan focus on Mrs. Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton herself reiterated that charge Tuesday. ""After more than two years and $7 million spent by the Benghazi Committee out of taxpayer funds, it had to today report that it had found nothing--nothing--to contradict the conclusions of...the prior multiple earlier investigations carried out on a bipartisan basis,"" she said.
The 2012 attack unfolded in two waves: first an assault on a U.S. diplomatic facility where Mr. Stevens and another State Department employee were killed, then a second assault on a nearby Central Intelligence Agency facility where two CIA contractors were the victims.
The panel faulted federal agencies for delays in mobilizing forces to assist Americans during the second assault. It found that a U.S. antiterrorism team in Spain was moved onto a plane, where members changed in and out of their military uniforms four times as officials debated what their role should be--an account disputed by the State Department on Tuesday.
The report also found that a top Pentagon official couldn't participate in a key conference call because he was hosting a dinner party at his home for foreign dignitaries.
""Nothing could have reached Benghazi because nothing was ever headed to Benghazi,"" Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) said. ""No U.S. military asset was ever deployed to Benghazi despite the order of the Secretary of Defense at 7 o'clock that night.""
The report also found that forces loyal to Mr. Gadhafi helped evacuate U.S. personnel from the CIA complex to the Benghazi airport.
The Benghazi committee's investigation into the attacks was the eighth congressional probe concerning the attacks, with Mr. Gowdy saying he wanted to write the definitive account of the incident. In addition, an independent State Department Accountability Review Board conducted an investigation that blamed ""systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" for the security situation in Libya.

Clinton's Benghazi Cover Story,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799979336?accountid=12768,"Democrats have succeeded in persuading the Washington press corps that what happened when four Americans died at Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012 isn't a story. But the House report released Monday about that night and its aftermath contains details that ought to concern Americans who care about political accountability.
Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in that attack that is dissected in 800-plus pages released by Republicans on a House Select Committee chaired by South Carolina's Trey Gowdy. The report's most disturbing facts concern the way the Obama Administration and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spun an alternative narrative that is contradicted by their private statements and the intelligence from the scene.
We learn from the report that the day after Mr. Stevens became the first American ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979, President Obama decided to skip his daily intelligence briefing.
We also learn that on the day of the attack, in a 5 p.m. meeting that included Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, Mr. Obama said the U.S. should use all available resources. After that meeting, Mr. Panetta returned to the Pentagon to discuss what military resources were available. The Defense Secretary then issued an order to deploy military assets to Libya.
But nothing was sent to Benghazi, and nothing was even in route when the last two Americans were killed almost eight hours after the attacks began. The holdup seems to have been caused in part by something else we learn from this report: a 7:30 p.m. teleconference of Defense and State officials, including Mrs. Clinton.
Ostensibly they were sharing intelligence and coordinating responses. But they debated whether they needed Libya's permission to deploy American troops to defend endangered Americans, whether Marines should wear uniforms or civilian clothes, and so on.
Even more telling: Though there was no evidence linking the Benghazi attacks to a YouTube video mocking Islam, of the 10 ""action items"" from the notes of that meeting, five referred to the video.
Mrs. Clinton referred to the video more than once in her public statements. At 10:08 p.m. on the night of the attack, she issued a public statement on Benghazi: ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others."" She repeated the point the next day at the State Department.
That's not what she was saying in private. On the night of the attack, at 6:49 p.m. Washington time, Mrs. Clinton called Libya's president to say the attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi was planned and that an Islamist terror group had claimed responsibility. A few hours later, she emailed her daughter that ""an Al Qaeda-like group"" was responsible.
The next afternoon Mrs. Clinton was even more categorical. In a phone call with the Egyptian Prime Minister, she said the Benghazi attack ""had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack--not a protest."" She added that the Benghazi attackers were believed affiliated with al Qaeda.
On Monday this week on the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton admitted that lots of Americans don't trust her. ""I personally know I have work to do on this front,"" she told her audience. This report shows she has earned that mistrust.
As have her fellow Democrats on the Select Committee. From the start they treated the House investigation the way Mrs. Clinton's State Department treated Benghazi--as a political issue. They refused to participate in the investigation and spent most of their time denouncing it as partisan. Their minority report on Benghazi contains no fewer than 23 mentions of Donald Trump.
The tragedy of Benghazi is that four brave Americans in a dangerous part of the world lost their lives to a determined and deadly enemy. The scandal of Benghazi is that instead of leveling with the American people, Mrs. Clinton and others who knew better opted for a more convenient--and corrosive--spin.",2016-09-19
"Milton Friedman's Morals; As Trump and Clinton bang the drums for tariffs and renegotiated deals, where's the popular voice for trade?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1820924635?accountid=12768,"Whether it's Donald Trump complaining ""we don't win on trade"" or Hillary Clinton vowing to appoint a ""chief trade prosecutor,"" our two main candidates for president are both campaigning on the idea that government needs to protect us from any foreigner who would sell us something at a better price than we could get at home.
Where's Milton Friedman when you need him?
In 1980, the Nobel Prize-winning economist brought the message of free markets and free trade into the homes of ordinary Americans via an extraordinary public television series called ""Free to Choose."" He did so without apology, without a prepared script and in plain language--moral as well as practical--that you didn't have to be an economist to understand.
He also did it against the prevailing mood that while free markets might be nice in theory, in reality what America needed was a healthy shot of protectionism: e.g., ""voluntary"" restrictions on Japanese cars, stronger anti-dumping statutes and greater enforcement of state ""buy American"" laws.
Is it so much different today? In an age when the global economy has helped lift billions out of abject poverty and put in the pockets of our children iPhones with more processing power than the computers NASA used to put a man on the moon, trade has become a dirty word.
The negatives of trade seemed to be confirmed by a now-famous 2012 graphic by economist Branko Milanovic, which plots how much real income has grown between 1988 and 2008 by income percentiles of the global population. Called the ""elephant chart"" because of its shape, it appears to prove the Trump-Clinton critique: that the winners from trade are foreigners and our top 1%, while the losers are the working and middle class in the developed West, including the U.S.
But the London-based Resolution Foundation has now recrunched the numbers to adjust for factors including population growth and the collapse of the U.S.S.R. When it did, it found that though income growth for the U.S. working and middle classes was smaller than for their peers in other Western economies, it was not stagnant.
In a recent Financial Times story, Resolution Foundation director Torsten Bell sounded a distinctly Friedmanite note: ""Although globalisation brings a range of challenges for lower income families, we need to be clear that weak income growth generally is rooted in domestic policy, and blaming globalisation takes the pressure off governments.""
What might such pressure look like? Well, Harvard economist Edward Glaeser suggests we might, for example, consider the way well-intentioned government programs can boomerang by discouraging work--everything from minimum-wage hikes that make low-skilled young men more expensive to hire to the huge marginal tax rates that kick in when, say, a single mom using some government benefit gets a job.
No one denies that Americans can lose jobs when an industry abroad is selling a good or service at a better price. But the high-employment, mass-manufacturing economy of the postwar years is not coming back no matter how high tariffs are or what we do to countries who manipulate their currencies. Even more interesting, the Resolution Foundation study reports average real income growth for lower- and middle-class workers in the U.K. was much higher than for their American counterparts, even though the U.K. has an economy that is more, not less, dependent on trade.
For his part, Friedman would ask by what right should an American be prevented from buying a lawful good or service if he found a better price from someone overseas? Where's the morality of keeping a worker from selling the product of his labor to someone who happens to live in another country? And the following was Friedman's response on ""Free to Choose"" when a union official challenged him on his bid to eliminate all tariffs over five years:
""The social and moral issues are all on the side of free trade. And it is you, and people like you, who introduce protection who are the ones who are violating fundamental moral and social issues.
""Tell me, what trade union represents the workers who are displaced because high tariffs reduce exports from this country, because high tariffs make steel and other goods more expensive, and as a result, those industries that use steel have to charge higher prices, they have fewer employees, the export industries that would grow up to balance the imports, tell me what union represents them? What moral and ethical view do you have about their interests?""
It's still a good question. Because here we are, seven weeks out from an election in which the Republican and the Democratic nominee are trying to outdo each other in their opposition to trade. And neither appreciates the irony that the very definition of a bad trade deal is one that inserts the heavy hand of government between a voluntary exchange that leaves both Citizen of Country A and Citizen of Country B better off.

Clinton Raises Nearly $70 Million,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800888281?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raised nearly $70 million in June for her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state parties across the U.S., her best fundraising month so far, her campaign said on Friday.
Of the $68.5 million raised last month by Mrs. Clinton's campaign, $40.5 million will go to her campaign and approximately $28 million will go to the DNC and state parties. Those state parties will use the funds for volunteer recruiting and field organizing for Mrs. Clinton's campaign and other Democratic candidates.
Mrs. Clinton's campaign enters July in a dominant financial position, with $44 million on hand. Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, hasn't announced his June fundraising totals, but he has struggled with fundraising since becoming the presumptive nominee.
Mr. Trump raised $3.1 million in May and had just $1.3 million cash on hand entering June--a paltry sum for a presidential campaign entering a general election match-up.
Mr. Trump has since increased his grass-roots donor outreach through email and has indicated that he may be willing to self-fund his general election bid.
The New York businessman also appointed a national finance chairman and finalized a joint fundraising vehicle with the Republican National Committee in May.
""Our first month of general-election fundraising proved to be the best of the campaign,"" said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook in a statement. ""Thanks to the continued support of nearly 1.6 million people, we have been able to help Democrats build out an organizing infrastructure across the country that will mobilize millions of voters and help elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot.""

Green Party Makes Inroads --- Pursuit of Sanders supporters threatens to siphon Democratic votes from Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800789615?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is aggressively courting disaffected supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, potentially undermining Democratic efforts to unify the party behind presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton.
Ms. Stein, the presumptive Green Party nominee, has been making the case in interviews, rallies and appearances across the country that supporters of Mr. Sanders should consider casting a ballot for her in the fall, emphasizing the common agenda and progressive worldview they share.
""We're picking up where Bernie left off. In fact, you could say we were here back in 2012 doing the same thing, long before Bernie's campaign,"" Ms. Stein said in an interview Friday.
Ms. Stein, 66, said her campaign has seen an influx of interest since Mrs. Clinton was declared the presumptive Democratic Party nominee after she secured enough delegates to deny Mr. Sanders the nomination--a point buttressed by her rising poll numbers and spiking interest on Google searches.
""For many people, we've been Plan B for when Bernie got shut down by the Democrats. And from my perspective, that's pretty much what was going to happen,"" she said, adding: ""It's hard to have a revolution in a counter-revolutionary party.""
With Mrs. Clinton and her likely Republican rival Donald Trump two of the most unpopular nominees in history, polls have found a growing appetite for alternatives. The most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released this past week had Ms. Stein drawing 6% of the vote nationwide in a four-way matchup with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump, and Libertarian Gary Johnson.
Ms. Stein's agenda calls for a higher minimum wage, a focus on renewable energy, better job security, universal health care and free education--all issues that Mr. Sanders has embraced. Their biggest contrast comes on foreign policy, where Ms. Stein has proposed massive defense cuts and disarmament.
The poll also shows that 14% of self-identified supporters of Mr. Sanders are backing Ms. Stein, while 9% say they support Mr. Trump. Another 8% say they will support the Libertarian ticket.
""Right now, she's definitely a landing spot for Sanders supporters who are not ready to commit to Clinton or don't like Clinton,"" said Tom Jensen, the polling director at the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling.
Mr. Jensen said both the Green Party and Libertarian presidential tickets are unlikely to pull more than a few percentage points in the fall, but that margin could be a problem in tight swing states.
""In a close race, you don't want to lose any support, of course. Just ask Al Gore, who might have been president if [Ralph] Nader had not taken votes from him,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama.
In the 2000 presidential race, Mr. Nader, running as head of the Green Party, drew nearly 100,000 left-leaning votes in Florida, while Democratic nominee Mr. Gore lost the state by about 500 votes to Republican nominee George W. Bush.
Mr. Nader has long objected to being called a spoiler, calling it a ""politically bigoted word"" in an interview this past week. ""Did Gore ever call Bush a spoiler? Why not? Didn't he take more votes away from Gore than I did?"" Mr. Nader said. ""I siphoned votes? How about Gore siphoning votes for me? Don't we have an equal right to run for election?""
Ms. Stein, a Harvard-educated physician, first emerged on the political scene in Massachusetts in 2002, where she launched a bid for governor on the Green-Rainbow Party ticket. She got about 3% of the vote in a race won by future Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
She went on to run statewide in Massachusetts two more times, launching unsuccessful bids for secretary of the commonwealth in 2006 and governor in 2010. She won the Green Party presidential nomination in 2012 and drew about 479,000 votes nationwide after appearing on ballots in 36 states. This year, the party is aiming to be on the ballot in 47 states.
Her current level of support in the poll would be double the Green Party's best-ever electoral showing at the presidential level, which was in 2000 when Mr. Nader, a consumer advocate, drew about 3% of the vote nationwide.
In addition to rising poll numbers, Google searches for the terms ""third party candidate"" are at their highest level recorded, according to data compiled by the digital-marketing company iQuanti earlier this year.
Search interest in ""independent"" or ""third party"" spiked in March as it became clearer that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were on track to be the nominees, the analysis showed. Google data show that search results for Ms. Stein have soared since April.
Most alarming for Mrs. Clinton is that the third-party candidates appear to be cutting into her clear lead against Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton has a five-point lead in a head-to-head matchup against Mr. Trump in the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll. When the Libertarian and Green Party candidates are included, her lead declines to just one point.
Her campaign declined to comment on Ms. Stein, as did Mr. Sanders's campaign.
Many progressives--including Sanders supporters--see the 2016 race differently from the 2000 showdown, warning that a vote for Ms. Stein is essentially a vote for Mr. Trump.
""The plan B for the political revolution that the Green Party seems to be pushing right now is the path to Chancellor Trump,"" said Neil Sroka, the communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America, which endorsed Mr. Sanders.
Ms. Stein's campaign is planning a high-visibility appearance at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this month, where she will lead a march and host a rally.
Ms. Stein extended an offer of collaboration with Mr. Sanders on the Green Party ticket, even floating the possibility that he could capture the Green Party nomination. She is only the presumptive nominee and won't officially be crowned until the party's August convention in Houston.
""If he could actually make the case for why we need to have independent politics, I think it's quite likely that he could be given the Green Party nomination,"" she said, adding that she was willing to ""put all possibilities on the table,"" including a withdrawal from the race.
""I'm a physician, not a politician. I'm concerned with healing our very sick political system, but I do not have a political career to establish for myself. That's not my goal here,"" she said.
Activists loyal to Mr. Sanders say Ms. Stein is being seriously considered by those who feel they are unable to cast a ballot for Mrs. Clinton.
""We are not going to vote for the demon named Hillary because they are threatening us with the devil named Trump. We will vote for a saint no matter what, and if that saint is not Bernie Sanders, then we will vote for the saint named Jill Stein,"" said Bill Taylor, a Philadelphia activist who is helping to plan four days of demonstrations in support of Mr. Sanders at the Democratic convention this month.
Mr. Taylor said his group would be willing to offer Ms. Stein some time at the rallies and marches that the pro-Sanders forces have reserved at the convention.
YahN Ndgo, another Philadelphia activist and a spokeswoman for the Bernie or Bust movement, said: ""For a lot of people who are in the Bernie or Bust movement, Hillary Clinton is just as bad as Donald Trump. And for some people, Hillary Clinton is worse than Donald Trump.""

Donald Trump Questions Police Shooting in Oklahoma; GOP nominee says police may be at fault; Clinton meets with families of those killed by officers,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1821941068?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who often expresses solidarity with law enforcement, said he was troubled by the shooting death last week of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Okla., and said the police may be at fault.
""That man went to the car, hands-up, put his hand on the car--to me it looked like he did everything you're supposed to,"" Mr. Trump said Wednesday in Cleveland, referring to 40-year- old Terence Crutcher.
The Tulsa police department and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating the shooting.
In Orlando, Fla., Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has met with families of African-Americans killed by police officers, invoked the shooting death of Mr. Crutcher as well as the separate shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, N.C., saying the two deaths were ""very upsetting.""
""It's unbearable,"" she said on Wednesday. ""And it needs to become intolerable.""
Mr. Scott's death ignited a night of violent protests in Charlotte, after his family said the father of seven was unarmed and killed while reading a book in his car. Kerr Putney, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police chief, said on Wednesday that Mr. Scott was armed, and refused to drop his gun.
In the Tulsa case, video footage showed the moment Mr. Crutcher was shot and killed by Oklahoma officer Betty Shelby, who was responding to a stalled vehicle.
The police department has opened a criminal investigation into the shooting, and the Justice Department is separately investigating whether a civil-rights violation occurred.
Mr. Trump told the crowd that he had watched the Tulsa video, and couldn't understand why the police officer decided to shoot.
""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking?"" Mr. Trump said about the officer. ""What happened? Now, maybe people that choke, people that do that, maybe can't be doing what they're doing.""
Mr. Trump has aimed to align himself with law enforcement as a racially charged debate has unfolded following police shootings and protests around the country.
The GOP nominee has called for allowing police more latitude in profiling suspects. He won the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police earlier this month and expressed support Wednesday in a town hall organized by Fox News for ""stop-and-frisk"" police tactics as a way to reduce violence.
A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the tactics used by New York Police Department in such stops were unconstitutional. Civil rights concerns have prompted other cities, including Chicago and Newark, N.J., to revamp their stop-and-frisk policies.
New York Mayor Bill De Blasio, a Democrat, slammed Mr. Trump for his comments. ""Crime has gone down since we got rid of the unconstitutional policy of stop and frisk,"" he said. ""I don't understand at all how a guy who calls himself a New Yorker could be this unaware of what's happened in the last few years in this city.""
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has been trying to repair his standing among minority voters. But he had support from only 5% of registered black voters in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken Sept. 16-19.
In Cleveland on Wednesday, Mr. Trump visited a mostly black church with former presidential candidate Ben Carson and Don King, the boxing promoter.
Introducing Mr. Trump, Mr. King tried to paint a more inclusive picture of the GOP nominee, calling him a ""doctor of humanness"" who looks out particularly for black Americans and women. ""I'm appealing to all the blacks because their vote is given away cavalierly...with no redeeming effect,"" he said.
Mr. King let slip an offensive racial epithet while making the case that ""black people in particular"" needed to rally behind the New York businessman. He recalled something he once told the late singer Michael Jackson: ""I told Michael Jackson, I said...if you are a talented intellectual, you are an intellectual Negro,"" he said. ""If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean Negro...,"" he trailed off.
In Orlando, Mrs. Clinton told her supporters there has been ""a long list of African-Americans killed by police officers."" She added that law enforcement handled recent terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota ""exactly right.""
""I've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply as I am and as committed as I am to reform, because they know it's essential for the safety of our communities and our officers,"" she said. ""We are safer when our communities respect police and police respect communities.""

REVIEW --- Talk Show --- The much-anticipated face-off between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will just be a TV spectacle; Real debate takes place in the course of governing (or at least it used to),http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1822602470?accountid=12768,"The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is only days away. What can we hope for? A revealing gaffe, a zinger that hits home, a flash of true spontaneity or a glimpse of the real character of the candidates -- these seem to be the most anyone is hoping for, and more than we are likely to get.
Debates, at their very best, are the diamonds of democratic politics -- crystal clear in argument, sparkling with wit, free from the discolorations of petty self-interest and shaped to focus light on the great issues of the day. But diamonds are rare, and no one is expecting a jewel on Monday night. The problem isn't only that our candidates are lackluster, tempting as that explanation may be. Nor does the fault lie mainly in the quality of the questions or the skill of the moderator. The forum itself is flawed. How many ways are there to say, ""Vote for me""? That line will always be more advertisement than argument.
The first televised presidential debate, starring John Kennedy and Richard Nixon, aired 56 years ago on Sept. 26, 1960. People who listened on the radio thought Nixon won, but those who watched on TV thought Kennedy won, and the election was so close that the TV factor might have made a difference. But should it have? Did viewers learn something from the grainy, flickering black and white images on their tiny TVs that was really relevant to the question of which policy or person was best for the country?
The Kennedy-Nixon debate garnered mixed reviews, including severe criticism from establishment figures. The journalist Edward R. Murrow called it ""a puny contribution, capsuled, homogenized, perhaps dangerous in its future implication."" The historian Henry Steele Commager responded with an essay entitled, ""Washington Would Have Lost a TV Debate."" ""The present formula of TV debate,"" he remarked, ""is designed to corrupt the public judgment and, eventually, the whole political process. The American Presidency is too great an office to be subjected to the indignity of this technique."" Though the televised debates returned and eventually became a regular part of the campaign, it is hard to think of even one that stands out as a model of informed and informative discourse.
During most campaign cycles, someone will write an essay comparing the disappointing pettiness of modern debates to the great Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, a series of daylong exchanges in various towns around Illinois during the contest between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas for a Senate seat. (Lincoln lost.) Whereas in modern televised debates, a candidate often has just 90 seconds for an answer, those debates gave each speaker 90 minutes for a single response. Audiences stood all day in the late summer sun to listen to intricate arguments about matters of national importance, such as the extension of slavery into the western territories. Our attention spans on the couch at home don't compare very well.
But even the Lincoln-Douglas debates left a lot to be desired. They brought out vices in both candidates: Lincoln spun out an elaborate conspiracy theory about the spread of slavery, Douglas moralized self-righteously, and both pandered energetically to the crowds. The architecture of some of Lincoln's greatest thoughts is visible in his remarks, but he also stooped low, assuring a crowd in Charleston, Ill., in the part of the state closer to the South, that he did not believe that African-Americans should be ""voters or jurors"" or ""intermarry with white people."" As for Douglas, his case for ""popular sovereignty"" in each state merely dressed up the extension of slavery into the territories as a matter of principle.
Traditionalists at the time reacted to these debates in much the same way that Murrow and Commager later responded to the Kennedy-Nixon debate -- as a scandal and an affront to the dignity of our institutions. ""The spirit of the Constitution is being violated in Illinois,"" wrote the editors of the Union, a Washington, D.C. newspaper. In those days, state legislatures, not the people at large, were responsible for electing senators, and the point of that arrangement, the Union reminded its readers, was to ""place the selection of a Senator beyond the reach of the maddening issues of the hour."" ""The whole country,"" the paper wrote, ""is disgusted with the scene"" in Illinois.
From that traditional perspective, the proper setting for political debate was thought to be the institutions of government themselves, not the campaign trail. Legislatures and parliamentary assemblies had evolved over centuries to encourage substantive discussion of concrete policy choices and to reduce the danger of demagoguery.
Lincoln's own favorite political oratory came not from campaign stumping but from congressional debate. He loved Daniel Webster's famous ""Second Reply to Hayne,"" which was delivered on the floor of the Senate in 1830. Sparked by a proposal to limit the sale of federal lands in the western territories, the debate quickly turned into an impassioned discussion of whether the national government was a creature of the states or a direct creation of the whole American people.
Sen. Robert Hayne of South Carolina made the case for the priority and independence of the states. Daniel Webster, young but poised and a polished speaker, put forward a vision of a great nation united by modernized roads and infrastructure and fortified by New England's manufacturers. Protecting that manufacturing sector with high tariffs on imports from Europe was one of Webster's immediate goals, but the debate explored how this policy would affect various parts of the country and linked the issue with questions of sectional politics, national strategy and constitutional principle. Webster helped Americans to imagine the nation that Lincoln would eventually fight to preserve.
Admirers of the Webster-Hayne debate often praise its most famous lines, such as Webster's memorable peroration. Hayne had worried that national unity would threaten the states' liberty. Webster's final line was a succinct answer: ""Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.""
But one turn of phrase -- a tweet, basically -- cannot capture what was special about Webster's speech, or about Hayne's. The real strength of the debate lay in the power and clarity with which both sides elaborated the complex arguments behind their different positions, allowing listeners to enter into each point of view and understand it from the inside. John Quincy Adams, the former president, wrote to Martin Van Buren that the debate was ""the most important one that has taken place since the existence of the government. The two doctrines are now before the nation.""
Webster's contribution has often been compared with that of Edmund Burke in England about 50 years earlier. Burke's speeches in Parliament, like Webster's in the Senate, became models of eloquence for generations of aspiring politicians and students. Like Webster, Burke did his best work in the context of particular legislative debates. He defended the desire for independence of the American colonists, pleaded for humane treatment of his native Ireland, predicted the worst excesses of the French Revolution, and excoriated the East India Company and colonial managers for their corrupt administration of India.
If Webster's reply to Hayne offers an example of how to debate protectionism with more depth than we have heard lately, Burke's speech in support of the India Bill of Charles James Fox in 1783 offers an example of how to debate the proper oversight of large corporations. Burke argued that the East India Company had violated the terms of its corporate charter and should be made to cede control over its operations in India to two commissions appointed by Parliament. He thus urged regulation of a company that had enjoyed nearly unlimited autonomy in its operations abroad.
The moral and psychological subtlety of Burke's case for reigning in that particular corporate excess dwarfs anything in our own public discourse. Instead of resorting to populist commonplaces, Burke explored the corrupting effects that working for the company in India was having on Britain's best and brightest. Young men arrived in India and were promptly given vast political and economic power with little oversight. They drank ""the intoxicating draught of authority and dominion before their heads are able to bear it,"" and then, Burke warned, they brought their newly acquired habits of imperial brutality back to England with them. These men, Burke told the House of Commons, ""marry into your families; they enter into your senate."" His arguments carried the chamber but could not overcome the king's influence in the House of Lords. He and his party ultimately lost the debate, but his speech remains an example of what debate can be.
If we are looking for exemplary debates, we should also look behind Burke and Webster to the classical models they would have studied in school -- above all, Demosthenes and Cicero. These were the great orators, respectively, of democratic Athens and republican Rome. Plutarch had paired them in his ""Parallel Lives,"" which was an obligatory part of a liberal education. Burke's long campaign to impeach Warren Hastings for his corrupt management of India owed much to Cicero's first speech in 70 B.C. against Verres, a corrupt Roman governor of Sicily.
As for Demosthenes, his speeches warning the Athenians of the growing strength of Philip II of Macedon in the fourth century B.C. had a furious, anxious power that comes across even today and even in translation. Simple in style, with little rhetorical ornament, Demosthenes' sentences concentrated the force of his mind into a few words, as a good punch concentrates the body's force into the inch between two knuckles. He was not running for office; he was pressing his fellow lawmakers to act.
Examples like these remind us that public debate at its best is a part of governing, not of campaigning. Webster and Burke, Cicero and Demosthenes -- all spoke in deliberative assemblies to a specific group of their fellow citizens who were empowered to decide together a particular law or course of action.
Their speeches were transcribed and published beyond the confines of the chamber to a much wider audience, but that was secondary; the immediate goal was to govern. The heyday of political debate in the U.S. lasted from the founding era through much of the 19th century, when arguments on the floor of legislatures directly informed decisions on policy. These deliberative institutions, whether local or national, focused debaters on particular questions and limited the audience they were addressing. Such settings imparted a natural discipline to the speeches given within them, encouraging substance.
Today public deliberation hardly ever takes place in our legislative assemblies, though sometimes a pretense is staged for the cameras. In the U.S., we have been at war in one theater or another for 15 years, and yet Congress has not had a sustained debate about these conflicts since the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the U.K. last spring, leaders declined to follow a centuries-old tradition of parliamentary debate and responsibility when making the most consequential choice of the country's recent history, to leave the European Union. They preferred to stage debates in the enormous and amorphous ""public sphere"" that the media creates and that individuals dip into and out of through their devices.
In our own increasingly fractured public sphere, the Commission on Presidential Debates has announced that the second debate between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, on October 9, ""will take the form of a town meeting, in which half of the questions will be posed directly by citizen participants.""
What exactly will these ""citizen participants"" participate in? They are offered roles in a television show. They will ask questions, as a reporter does, to help elicit responses that might inform the public. This can certainly be useful, but we should not let the language of ""town meetings"" and ""participation"" obscure the limitations of the forum. One thing that the staged presidential debates cannot offer is a reminder of what debating sounds like when it is actually a part of self-government.
Years ago, when I lived in Williamstown, Mass., I attended a real town meeting to discuss the municipality's annual budget. Citizens did not pose questions; they made arguments. A youth program had been cut, and townspeople argued pro and con and then voted. The program was saved, with funds shifted from elsewhere. No one offered oratory for the ages, but it was a good debate, full of clear, forceful, responsible arguments. Demosthenes would have been proud.
In the history of democratic societies, it was the intense pressures of governing together that occasionally compressed the sand of ordinary political speech into a gem or two of public oratory worth saving. We have mostly let public debate float free from the pressures of our governing institutions these days. We should not be surprised that we do not produce diamonds.

Clinton's 'Deplorables' Clamor for La Verite,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1822602375?accountid=12768,"Regarding Daniel Henninger's ""Les Deplorables"" (Wonder Land, Sept. 15): Mr. Henninger concludes that, ""If the Democrats lose behind Hillary Clinton, it will be in part because America's les deplorables decided enough of this is enough."" The ""this"" in Mr. Henninger's estimation is the progressive barrage of political correctness and self-righteous indignation that now has degenerated into a ""confused moral narcissism.""
The other side of Mr. Henninger's political coin is that if the Democrats win behind Hillary Clinton, all of the cultural trends of the last eight years will be reaffirmed and accelerated. One wonders, then, if in a few years it will be deplorable to stand up for the national anthem at a sporting event, assuming the anthem is still played. The progressive transformation of the last eight years was extraordinary in speed and scope, and the non-deplorables supporting Mrs. Clinton may succeed in associating the national anthem and the stars and stripes with racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and Islamophobia. Unless America atones fully for its past transgressions and current injustices, our stained national symbols may have to change, along with our traditions and history (per Michelle Obama) and our deep-seated cultural codes and religious beliefs. Until that cleansing takes place, standing up for injustice during the national anthem may be a sign that one is an unrepentant bigot. Colin Kaepernick's kneeling in protest may be the norm -- until we are all progressively perfected.

In our own increasingly fractured public sphere, the Commission on Presidential Debates has announced that the second debate between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, on October 9, ""will take the form of a town meeting, in which half of the questions will be posed directly by citizen participants.""
What exactly will these ""citizen participants"" participate in? They are offered roles in a television show. They will ask questions, as a reporter does, to help elicit responses that might inform the public. This can certainly be useful, but we should not let the language of ""town meetings"" and ""participation"" obscure the limitations of the forum. One thing that the staged presidential debates cannot offer is a reminder of what debating sounds like when it is actually a part of self-government.
Years ago, when I lived in Williamstown, Mass., I attended a real town meeting to discuss the municipality's annual budget. Citizens did not pose questions; they made arguments. A youth program had been cut, and townspeople argued pro and con and then voted. The program was saved, with funds shifted from elsewhere. No one offered oratory for the ages, but it was a good debate, full of clear, forceful, responsible arguments. Demosthenes would have been proud.
In the history of democratic societies, it was the intense pressures of governing together that occasionally compressed the sand of ordinary political speech into a gem or two of public oratory worth saving. We have mostly let public debate float free from the pressures of our governing institutions these days. We should not be surprised that we do not produce diamonds.

U.S. News: Clinton Pushes Back Over Email Criticism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805655339?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton said Friday she was relieved that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had wrapped up its probe into her private email server, but she pushed back against assertions that she was careless in handling classified information.
In her first comments about the FBI's decision not to pursue charges against her, the likely Democratic presidential nominee praised investigators' professionalism and reiterated that she had erred by using a private email account for government business during her tenure as secretary of state.
""I have said many times, and I repeat clearly today: It was a mistake for me to use personal email, and I regret that,"" Mrs. Clinton told CNN.
On Tuesday, FBI Director James Comey recommended against charging Mrs. Clinton for mishandling classified information. But while he concluded that the former secretary of state hadn't intended to violate the law, Mr. Comey delivered a scathing assessment of her actions, criticizing her for being ""extremely careless"" with the country's secrets.
The FBI found that 113 of the emails Mrs. Clinton sent or received contained information considered classified at the time. Mr. Comey has said that Mrs. Clinton may have believed that some of the emails in question were unclassified because they weren't properly marked.
In a pair of interviews on Friday, Mrs. Clinton said that she takes classified material seriously and emphasized the lack of markings on the emails. She added that her former aides had sent many of the disputed emails to her account.
""I certainly did not believe that I received or sent any material that was classified, and indeed, any of the documents that have been referred to, I think were not marked or were marked inaccurately,"" she told CNN.
Mrs. Clinton declined to say whether she would cooperate with a State Department investigation examining her use of a private email server.
The State Department had suspended its examination, but said this week that it would reopen its internal investigation into whether the former secretary of state or her aides mishandled classified information in connection with her email account.
House Republicans also have said that they would seek a new FBI investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton lied to Congress when testifying about her handling of classified information.

GOP Seeks More on Emails --- Lawmakers push for FBI probe on whether Clinton lied about classified information,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805654940?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans said Thursday they would seek a new Federal Bureau of Investigation examination into Hillary Clinton, this one focused on whether she lied to Congress about her handling of classified information, raising the likelihood the controversy over her private email system will continue through the fall elections.
The announcement came as FBI Director James Comey appeared before Congress to forcefully defend his recommendation to the Justice Department earlier this week against charging Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Comey said that only once in the past century had charges been levied against someone for handling classified information negligently but without malign intent.
Conduct like Mrs. Clinton's could lead to administrative penalties if the individual were still in the government, Mr. Comey told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, but he doesn't believe the former secretary of state should be prosecuted.
""We don't want to put people in jail unless we can prove they knew they were doing something they shouldn't do,"" Mr. Comey said.
The FBI director suggested Mrs. Clinton reasonably assessed that some of the disputed emails were unclassified because they weren't properly marked. He added that she may not have been ""sophisticated"" about the treatment of classified information. Those are potential obstacles for a push to prosecute her for lying to Congress about whether particular emails were classified.
The nearly five-hour back-and-forth between Republicans, Democrats and Mr. Comey marked an extraordinary moment, as top lawmakers grilled an FBI director over a prosecutorial decision regarding a presumptive presidential nominee. The session came two days after Mr. Comey made his recommendation against charges at a rare news conference, in which he also criticized Mrs. Clinton for having been ""extremely careless"" with protecting the nation's secrets.
Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said the campaign was pleased with the hearing's outcome, despite the ""partisan motivations"" for holding it.
""Director Comey's testimony clearly knocked down a number of false Republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and Hillary Clinton's public statements,"" he said.
As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton used a private email server for government business, something she now admits was a mistake.
The FBI found that 113 of the emails she sent or received contained information that was considered classified at the time, while an additional 2,000 or so were deemed classified later.
The hearing Thursday made it clear that in this heated political season, the email issue is unlikely to fade.
Republicans repeatedly expressed incredulity that Mrs. Clinton wouldn't be prosecuted despite the FBI's findings that she mishandled classified information and that her carelessness possibly enabled hostile actors to gain access to state secrets.
Democrats said the decision meant she wouldn't be singled out solely because she is a high-profile figure.
Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) asked if the FBI looked into whether Mrs. Clinton perjured herself in an October 2015 hearing before the Republican-led House Benghazi committee. Mr. Comey said the FBI would have needed a referral from Congress to do so. ""You'll have one in the next few hours,"" Mr. Chaffetz replied. That raises the possibility that another FBI investigation into Mrs. Clinton could continue well into the fall election campaign and possibly beyond.
At the heart of the perjury dispute is Mrs. Clinton's testimony before the Benghazi committee, which investigated the 2012 terrorist attack in Libya that killed the U.S. ambassador, in which she said ""there was nothing marked classified on my emails, either sent or received.""
The FBI investigation found that three emails of the more than 30,000 reviewed by agents contained classification markings, according to Mr. Comey.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.) said it defies credulity that Mrs. Clinton didn't know that a ""(C)"" by certain paragraphs in the emails meant the information was classified. Mr. Comey disagreed, suggesting Mrs. Clinton wasn't well-versed in the classification system.
""It's an interesting question whether she was sophisticated enough to understand what a C in parens means,"" Mr. Comey said. ""It's possible -- possible -- she didn't understand what a (C) meant when she saw it in the body of the email like that.""
He later added that none of the emails in question were properly prefaced with headers to signal that classified information was included below.
A State Department spokesman said Wednesday that the letter markings on those emails resulted from ""human error"" and never belonged in the emails in the first place, as the material wasn't actually classified.
Mr. Chaffetz said he was ""mystified"" by Mr. Comey's recommendation against charges, given the recklessness the FBI found on Mrs. Clinton's part, and said she was being held to a different standard than ordinary Americans.
""It seems to a lot of us that the average Joe, the average American, that if they had done what you laid out in your statement, that they'd be in handcuffs and they might be on their way to jail and they probably should,"" Mr. Chaffetz said. ""There is a legitimate concern that there is a double standard.""
Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee's top Democrat, supported Mr. Comey's assertion that others in Mrs. Clinton's position wouldn't have been prosecuted, lacking evidence of a willful intent to violate the law.
""If prosecutors had gone forward, they would have been holding the secretary to a different standard from everyone else,"" Mr. Cummings said.
Under questioning, Mr. Comey stressed what he said were key differences between Mrs. Clinton's case and that of David Petraeus, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Mr. Petraeus, he said, knowingly shared classified information with his biographer and then lied to the FBI about doing so.
""In my mind, it illustrates importantly the distinction to this case,"" Mr. Comey said.

"Election 2016: Biden to Stump for Clinton --- Joint appearance in Scranton, Pa., aimed at bolstering support of blue-collar voters",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805654434?accountid=12768,"Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to make his campaign-trail debut on behalf of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at an event Friday in Scranton, Pa., a working-class city that is both an important political crossroads and where both Democrats have roots.
The northeast Pennsylvania city of about 75,000 people was once at the heart of a thriving coal-mining industry but has fallen on harder times in recent decades.
Though Scranton is neither an economic powerhouse nor a big population center, the city looms large as a campaign-trail stop for politicians of both parties because of its large white, working-class population that was once reliably Democratic and now trends Republican.
""Scranton has always been a hot spot for candidates,"" said Richard Bishop, a local attorney who is active in the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce.
The vice president arrives with two goals: to help unify the Democratic Party after Mrs. Clinton's long primary fight with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and to shore up support among voters who are also targets for GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump.
Mr. Trump visited the area in April. In the Pennsylvania GOP primary, he won with about 70% of the vote in the county that includes Scranton.
Mr. Biden was born in the city and spent his early childhood there before moving to Delaware.Mrs. Clinton's father, Hugh Rodham, is also from the city, though she grew up in Illinois. The two Democrats ""will discuss their shared commitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone,"" the Clinton campaign said.
Though a GOP presidential candidate hasn't carried Pennsylvania since 1988, the state is one of 17 battlegrounds that the Trump campaign identified as targets this week. Scranton and places like it could help determine the outcome.
According to the 2010 census, Scranton is 84% white. Only 21.4% of the population has a college degree, while more than 40% of the city is out of the civilian labor force.
Republicans carried non-college-educated white voters in Pennsylvania 56% to 42% in the 2012 election, according to exit polls, though Democrats won the state. Lackawanna County, which includes Scranton and nearby boroughs and municipalities, voted for President Barack Obama over his GOP rival Mitt Romney 63% to 35% in 2012.
Polling experts Peter Hart and Corrie Hunt recently convened a focus group of blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania, concluding many were receptive to Mr. Trump's message and skeptical of Mrs. Clinton.
""With this group of voters, he remains competitive,"" they wrote in their analysis. ""For now, Hillary Clinton is ahead, but how the blue-collar vote goes will tell us whether election night will be a nail-biter or one that allows the Democrats to win the presidency.""
The joint appearance by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden is evidence Mr. Trump's message -- particularly his stance against illegal immigration -- may have appeal in the region, and that they will need to fight for every vote.
U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, whose district extends into the outskirts of Scranton, emerged on the national stage as mayor of nearby Hazleton, where he fought to stop illegal immigrants from working or living in the city.
""These are mainly blue-collar Americans. They've seen their wages depressed by illegal immigration. They understand the effect that it has on communities like Hazleton and other small towns in Pennsylvania where jobs are hard to find,"" Mr. Barletta, a Republican, said in an interview about his constituents in the region.

Information Age: Clinton's Information Lockdown,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803590259?accountid=12768,"Lyndon Johnson did his best to block the Freedom of Information Act, but public opinion forced him to make government records available. The question now is how FOIA, which LBJ signed 50 years ago this month, survives the precedent Hillary Clinton set with her basement server intended to keep her emails hidden from public view.
Bill Moyers, LBJ's press secretary at the time, recalled in a 2003 broadcast how FOIA nearly didn't become law: The president ""hated the very idea of a Freedom of Information Act, hated the idea of journalists rummaging in government closets, hated them challenging the official view of reality.""
LBJ relented and signed what he called ""the damned thing"" on July 4, 1966, but insisted on no fanfare. In the decades that followed, FOIA became an essential tool for government accountability.
No public official since LBJ has gone as far as Hillary Clinton to evade public-disclosure laws. In 2010 her adviser Huma Abedin recommended that she use a government email account, as the State Department required. ""I don't want any risk of the personal being accessible,"" Mrs. Clinton responded in an email that has since come to light. She used a private email server for all her communications because this kept both official and personal communications off government servers, where they would have been subject to disclosure under FOIA.
FBI Director James Comey concluded that Mrs. Clinton's mishandling of classified information in her emails didn't meet the legal test for a crime because he couldn't prove that she intended to disclose national secrets. But Mr. Comey testified to Congress last week that the FBI determined that Mrs. Clinton did violate the Federal Records Act, which makes his legal analysis of her intent incomplete. Her most relevant intention was to defy disclosure laws. Her actions had the incidental effect of mishandling confidential communications.
Mrs. Clinton stonewalled FOIA requests for years with her keep-no-records, produce-no-records strategy. In a deposition last month in a civil lawsuit challenging her personal email server, the State Department said its staffers in charge of records didn't realize until 2014 that its former boss had used private email.
Appropriately enough, Mrs. Clinton's explanation that she used a private email server to keep her records secret only became public in a lawsuit challenging the State Department's insistence that it couldn't respond to FOIA requests because it couldn't locate her emails on its .gov server.
The State Department's inspector general in May ruled that Mrs. Clinton broke record-keeping laws such as those requiring compliance with FOIA requests, never got permission for her home server and ignored numerous security warnings.
President Obama came to office pledging that his administration would be ""the most open and transparent in history,"" but instead allowed Mrs. Clinton to operate above the disclosure laws. The federal appeals court in Washington this month reprimanded the administration for ducking a FOIA request by arguing that the official being questioned at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy used a private email account, so the emails weren't in government control. In words that could equally apply to Mrs. Clinton's conduct, the judges said evading government servers is no defense against a FOIA request:
""If a department head can deprive the citizens of their right to know what his department is up to by the simple expedient of maintaining his departmental emails on an account in another domain, that purpose is hardly served,"" the judges wrote. ""It would make as much sense to say that the department head could deprive requestors of hard-copy documents by leaving them in a file at his daughter's house and then claiming that they are under her control.""
Most ominously, Mr. Comey confirmed that foreign intelligence agencies have more access than Americans to what Mrs. Clinton hid on her home-brew computer. The FBI confirmed that foreign hackers almost certainly raided her unsecure server to get the nation's top secrets. This includes all 60,000 of her emails -- not just the 30,000 she chose to disclose.
Mrs. Clinton's missing 30,000 emails could still become public. Recent reports indicate that Russian agents hacked the servers of the Clinton Foundation and the Democratic National Committee. Vladimir Putin can now triangulate information from the Clinton emails, the Clinton Foundation and the DNC. He could launch an October surprise to affect the U.S. election by disclosing information Mrs. Clinton tried to keep hidden. Or he could keep the information for himself as a sword over the head of a potential next president.
In this Facebook era of aggressive personal transparency, voters will have to decide what to make of Mrs. Clinton's going to such lengths to keep her communications secret. Her behavior is a powerful reminder that the need for FOIA disclosure about government officials has only grown over the past 50 years.

Health of the U.S. Economy Is a Matter of Debate; Poised for takeoff or in steep decline? Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump present differing visions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1823606514?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton put forward sharply different portraits of the U.S. economy in their first face-to-face debate, offering voters a choice not only on the details of trade and tax policy but also on which assessment best reflects the state of the nation.
The Democratic nominee characterized the economy as improving--and nearing a turn toward breakout growth--from the past decade's financial crisis and housing bust. Her Republican rival saw no such recovery. He described a country in steep decline, with aging infrastructure and jobs by the thousands flowing to Mexico and China.
Both have some ground to stand on in the current economic landscape.
On the upside, the economy has continued to add jobs at a steady clip, with a hiring streak that surpassed its previous record in March and is now at 70 straight months. The unemployment rate is below 5%, gas prices have fallen below $2.50 a gallon and home prices have recovered to last decade's levels. Median household incomes rose 5% last year, the Census Bureau reported earlier this month, leaving them 1.6% below the 2007 level, before the last recession struck.
But economic growth, in the U.S. and abroad, has been sluggish since the last recession ended in 2009, with global central banks holding rates near zero to boost borrowing and consumption.
In the U.S., the homeownership rate has fallen to a 50-year low, and a large swath of Americans now say they worry their children won't face the same opportunities for upward mobility that they did.
Even with recent gains in income, the typical male full-time worker earned around $150 less last year than in 1998, after adjusting for inflation.
One question now is which view of the economy will resonate most with voters this fall: one of a crippled nation in a ""big, fat, ugly bubble,"" as Mr. Trump said Monday, or one on the cusp of better times after nearly 15 years of mediocre growth.
The debate came at a time when gauges of consumer confidence are generally showing solid readings. The latest measure Tuesday from the Conference Board hit its highest point in nine years , a sign American households are emerging from the recession's long shadow and could continue to support U.S. economic growth.
The Conference Board's consumer-confidence index increased to a seasonally adjusted 104.1 in September from an upwardly revised 101.8 in August, the business research group said. That was its highest level since August 2007, which marked the start of the financial crisis that led to the severe 2007-09 recession.
The September confidence surge ""suggests that the presidential election campaign is not having a detrimental effect on sentiment,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
During the debate, Mr. Trump dismissed signs of stronger growth as a mirage. ""The only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down,"" he said.
Mrs. Clinton talked about how bad off the country was when President Barack Obama took over in 2009, and how far things have come. ""We have come back from that abyss, and it has not been easy,"" she said. ""So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy.""

"Mexican Peso, Emerging-Market Currencies Rally After U.S. Debate; The dollar falls against peso as investors bet first presidential debate boosts support for Hillary Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1823495070?accountid=12768,"The Mexican peso and other emerging-market currencies strengthened on Tuesday, as investors bet the first U.S. presidential debate boosted support for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The dollar fell 2.3% against the Mexican peso to 19.4152 pesos. Among other emerging-market currencies, the dollar was down 1.8% against the South African rand and 1.1% against the South Korean won.
The Mexican peso has been highly sensitive to the U.S. election, as investors worry that Republican candidate Donald Trump's plans to build a wall between the two countries and renegotiate trade agreements could damage Mexico's economy.
Though it remains unclear if the debate will alter the course of the race, Tuesday's rallies in risk-sensitive currencies such as the peso and South African rand pointed to relief among many currency investors.
""The prospect of a Trump victory had some investors nervous about his more-radical policy views on the issues of immigration and trade,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Forex, in a note to investors. ""To the extent that Mrs. Clinton represents the status quo, her victory is likely to be least damaging to market sentiment and to the dollar.""
Meanwhile, the WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, fell 0.1% to 86.25 despite a report from the Conference Board showing U.S. consumer confidence rose in September to its highest level since the recession.
The euro fell 0.3% to $1.12185 amid concerns about the health of German lender Deutsche Bank and other European banks. The Canadian dollar recovered, rising about 0.1% from Monday's six-month low versus the dollar, as investors responded to the U.S. debate's outcome.
Analysts say the Canadian dollar, which has been pummeled by the decline in oil prices, is also sensitive to the election outcome because of Canada's close trade relationship with the U.S.

Asian Shares Broadly Higher After U.S. Presidential Debate; Investors believe Hillary Clinton delivered a stronger performance than Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1823287819?accountid=12768,"Stock markets rose broadly across Asia on Tuesday, reversing early declines as investors conclude that U.S. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton won the first presidential debate .
The Nikkei Stock Average closed up 0.8%, having traded 1.6% lower before the head-to-head with Republican nominee Donald Trump. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.2% after opening flat, the Shanghai Composite Index and Korea's Kospi both reversed losses to end up 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively.
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump came together late Monday in the U.S. just as Asian markets opened for trading, presenting starkly different visions of how they would run the world's largest economy in a no-holds-barred attack on each other's biggest vulnerabilities.
""She was clearly better prepared and knowledgeable,"" said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG Markets.
""The market liked the idea of a higher degree of certainty from her policies. Some of Trump's more radical policies involved having control of Congress, which seems unlikely now and the market is sensing some relief,"" Mr. Weston said.
Driven by a rise in U.S. S&P 500 futures, Asian stocks caught an updraft as the market shrugged off some of the uncertainty posed by Mr. Trump.
After the debate, the Japanese yen fell 0.5% against the U.S. dollar, helping exporters' shares turn positive. Among auto makers, Toyota Motor closed up 1.6% and Mazda Motor jumped 2.4%.
Blue-chip companies with heavy U.S. market exposure were among the biggest gainers in Hong Kong, with trading house Li & Fung, which sources for key U.S. retailers, last up 3.9%, while casino operator Sands China gained 3.6% and banking giant HSBC Holdings added 1.7%.
In other currencies, investors also bought the Mexican peso, last up 1.8% against the dollar after hitting an all-time low earlier in the Asia session, likely indicating the market believed Mrs. Clinton performed better than Mr. Trump, said Mr. Weston.
While broader Japanese stocks turned around on Tuesday, banks there remained the biggest losers, following a global fall in the sector overnight as concerns intensified over the health of Deutsche Bank. The bank's shares slid 7.5% Monday to their lowest level in decades.
At the center of concerns about Deutsche Bank, a linchpin of Europe's financial system, is the question of whether the lender would need to raise capital to fortify its increasingly precarious finances, though the bank said Monday it was ""fundamentally strong.""
""It's the banking sector in Europe that triggered all this movement and selloff in equities...then you saw [a shift to] risk-off mode,"" said Tareck Horchani, deputy head of Asian Pacific sales trading at Saxo Capital Markets.
Like their European peers, Japanese financial firms are struggling with the ultralow interest-rate environment .
Japan's Topix banks index ended down 1.3%. Among individual stocks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group lost 1.4% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group declined 0.7%.
The release of the minutes of the Bank of Japan's most recent meeting also provoked investor jitters, as the board's caution about expanding the BOJ's stock-fund buying could add to speculation that the central bank is now more hesitant to dramatically ease policy.
Elsewhere, a slide in oil prices pressured stocks in commodity-reliant economies after Iran said it expects Wednesday's meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will be merely ""consultative,"" and vowed to keep pumping until output reaches pre-sanction levels.
Among stock markets with a significant focus on energy, the S&P/ASX 200 ended down 0.5%, and the FTSE Bursa Malaysia was recently down 0.4%. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, declined 0.4% to $47.16 a barrel in Asian trade.
In other commodities, copper was down 0.2% at $4,833 a metric ton and gold fell 0.2% to $1,334.39 a troy ounce.

"Ted Cruz Endorses Donald Trump, Citing Concerns Over Hillary Clinton; Senator had refused to endorse nominee at Republican convention",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1822488904?accountid=12768,"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said Friday that he plans to vote for GOP primary rival Donald Trump in November, citing his earlier pledge to back whoever won the Republican Party's nomination and his deep concerns about a Hillary Clinton presidency.
The endorsement marks a sharp reversal for Mr. Cruz, who had called Mr. Trump a ""pathological liar"" on the closing day of his campaign run and later declined to endorse Mr. Trump at the Republican National Convention.
Mr. Cruz delivered his support and asked others to vote for Mr. Trump in a statement on Facebook . It came after a weekslong campaign from Trump allies led by Mr. Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Messrs. Pence and Cruz spoke by phone and then met in Washington last week.
""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,"" Mr. Cruz wrote.
In a statement released by his campaign, Mr. Trump said: ""I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz."" He added: ""We have fought the battle, and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.""
Mr. Cruz's endorsement comes at a moment when the Republican Party has begun to coalesce behind Mr. Trump. This week's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found 85% of Republicans said they would vote for Mr. Trump, a 4-percentage-point increase from last month's survey. Also, major GOP donors recently announced plans to spend millions of dollars to back Mr. Trump.
Mr. Cruz made his case for Mr. Trump largely by arguing against Mrs. Clinton. He asked supporters who agree with his critique of the Democrat to vote for the GOP nominee.
""A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment,"" he said. ""And if you don't want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him.""
In his statement, Mr. Cruz didn't address his past disputes with Mr. Trump, who among other insults dubbed the Texas senator ""Lyin' Ted,"" suggested he was ineligible to be president due to his birthplace and repeated tabloid reports about his father being tied to John F. Kennedy's assassin.
""This man is a pathological liar,"" Mr. Cruz said of Mr. Trump on the day he ended his presidential campaign. ""He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology text book, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.""
The question of whether to back Mr. Trump has divided Mr. Cruz's top aides for months. The angry response from fellow Republicans to Mr. Cruz's July convention speech surprised the senator's top aides. As late as Friday morning, one person who served a senior role on Mr. Cruz's campaign said Mr. Cruz would ""destroy his brand"" by backing Mr. Trump and would take himself out of contention for the party's 2020 nomination should Mr. Trump lose the White House to Mrs. Clinton.
Days after Mr. Cruz's defiant convention speech Mr. Trump predicted to a crowd in Cleveland that the Texan would eventually back him--and that he didn't want the endorsement.
""You know he'll come and endorse over the next little while. He'll come and endorse. It's because he has no choice,"" Mr. Trump said then. ""But I don't want his endorsement.""
Signs of a potential detente came earlier this week, when Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced his support for an ""internet freedom"" bill Mr. Cruz has championed. He also backed him hours after the nominee added Utah Sen. Mike Lee , a close ally of Mr. Cruz, to his list of potential Supreme Court justices. Mr. Cruz in his statement said Mr. Lee would ""make an extraordinary justice.""
Another potential factor in Mr. Cruz's decision to publicly back Mr. Trump: one of the senator's top donors has in recent months expanded his influence in the Trump campaign. Hedge-fund executive Robert Mercer poured more than $13 million into super PACs backing Mr. Cruz during the Republican primary. When Mr. Cruz quit the race, Mr. Mercer turned his super PAC into a new group, called Make America Number 1, which now supports Mr. Trump. The group is now headed by Mr. Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, and received another $2 million from Mr. Mercer in July.
The Mercers' role in the Trump campaign has recently expanded, particularly after Mr. Trump took their advice on implementing a campaign shake-up in which he elevated Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen Bannon and pollster Kellyanne Conway--both of whom have longstanding ties to the Mercers. Ms. Conway ran the Mercers' pro-Cruz super PAC before joining the Trump campaign.
Mr. Trump also won the backing this week of TD Ameritrade Corp. founder Joe Ricketts, a major GOP donor who during the primaries funded Our Principles PAC, the super PAC devoted to defeating Mr. Trump. Mr. Ricketts pledged $1 million to back Mr. Trump, a modest sum compared with what he spent to defeat him.

"How Generous Are the Candidates? Should Voters Care? Clinton and Trump have told us something in the way they go about giving, or not giving.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1824056874?accountid=12768,"There has been much ado about the philanthropic practices of the Democratic and Republican nominees for president. As in most election cycles, Americans look at charitable giving to ascertain how philanthropic the candidates appear to be, although history shows this doesn't always affect election chances or predict performance in office. This year, such a judgment is harder than usual.
For Hillary Clinton, the question is whether the Clinton Foundation--a public charity established by former president Bill Clinton in 1997 to marshal contributions from many donors--has been run for political and personal advantage while pursuing charitable activities. Accusations of conflicts of interest involving the foundation--and its donors, including foreign governments--have dogged Mrs. Clinton since she began running for senator from New York in 2000, and intensified after she became secretary of state in 2009. Information from her emails and State Department records has heightened these concerns.
For Mr. Trump--whose foundation is a family foundation, the type that usually distributes money from the people who established it--the issue is whether he has been generous with his own money. He claims to have given large amounts to charities, often anonymously. But without access to his most recent tax returns, the only evidence of his philanthropy is the Donald J. Trump Foundation with reported assets of $1.3 million in 2014, which is tiny for someone of his supposed wealth. For the past decade, the foundation apparently has received no money from Mr. Trump or his family, only contributions from friends and business associates. Reporters have tried in vain to find donations he may have made outside the foundation.
But there is a more basic question: Why should voters care how philanthropic their presidential candidates are? The answer isn't clear.
Being generous is no guarantee of being a good president. The most philanthropic person to have run for president in modern times may have been Herbert Hoover, who led humanitarian relief efforts in Belgium, Russia and other countries during and after World War I. Yet his presidency was disappointing, ending as it did in America's worst depression.
Then again, some presidents have been reasonably successful despite signs of charitable inadequacy. As a candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton was embarrassed by the revelation that he and his wife had claimed charitable tax deductions for donations of used underwear and ripped clothing.
If philanthropy mattered to electability, 2012's Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney would now be finishing his first term in office: According to his 2011 tax return, Mr. Romney, a successful businessman and practicing Mormon, donated nearly 30% of his income to charities.
By contrast, in the years before Barack Obama ran for the Senate, his family gave away less than 1% of its more than $200,000 a year in income. Among his excuses was that he and his wife were still paying off student loans. After embarking on the path that led to the White House, including publication of a best-selling memoir, Mr. Obama raised his game and achieved a giving rate of over 20% of his income in 2011.
Vice President Joe Biden was positively Scrooge-like. In the decade before 2008, while he was a senator and his wife taught college, the Bidens donated a minuscule portion of their combined income. He claimed to have contributed a lot of his time to charities; this may have included attending ribbon-cuttings and awards dinners. Yet in 2011, the Bidens' rate of giving reached a mere 1.5% of income. That's less than the amount of income that Americans typically give to charity, which is about 2%, according to the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.
One might forgive such stinginess by noting that as an advocate of expanding government programs in which taxpayers supply the forced donations, he (like Mr. Obama) considers personal philanthropy to be relatively unimportant. By the same token, Mitt Romney's willingness to donate a substantial amount of his own money for religious and charitable purposes is consistent with his support for limited government.
As for this year's candidates--and despite the ambiguities in the operations of their foundations--Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have told us something in the way they have gone about giving, or not giving. One candidate's view of philanthropy is, for better or worse, expansive--in her foundation's mission, operations, and myriad relationships with government and in the fortunes of people connected to the foundation. Another candidate has a view of philanthropy that is, for better or worse, smaller: He has a tiny foundation whose aim--apart from scattered and limited contributions--seems to be to buttress a claim, otherwise unsupported, that he is generous. Even that backing has been called into question by the news that his foundation may have paid his private business debts.
We probably pay attention to the philanthropy of candidates because we want to know if they display some sympathy for the well-being of others. We pay attention to other qualities as well, which is why the most generous candidates don't always win and the miserly don't always lose. But this year the candidates' charitable behavior may tell us more than it usually does about the differences in character each would bring to the Oval Office.

Election 2016: Lawmakers Seek New Clinton Probe,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803017288?accountid=12768,"Republican lawmakers on Monday formally requested a probe of whether Hillary Clinton perjured herself in testimony to lawmakers about her use of a private email server while secretary of state.
Separately, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the likely Democratic presidential nominee will receive intelligence briefings in the run-up to the November elections, despite pressure from some Republicans to ban her access to the information after criticism by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of her handling of classified emails.
The FBI last week recommended against charging Mrs. Clinton over her email practices, and the Justice Department closed the investigation into the matter. But at a hearing last week with FBI Director James Comey, GOP lawmakers questioned why agents didn't examine the possibility Mrs. Clinton perjured herself when testifying about her email use in past hearings.
""The evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony,"" Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a letter to Channing Phillips, the U.S. attorney in Washington.
Republicans have pointed to three emails sent to Mrs. Clinton that contained a particular marking, ""(C),"" which is used to denote confidential information. Mrs. Clinton has testified that she never sent or received any emails with classified markings. Democrats have argued in the case of those messages, the markings may have been a mistake by the original author.
An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on the request for a new investigation.
A Clinton campaign spokesman called the request ""another futile, partisan attempt to keep this issue alive.""

How Clinton Can Resurrect Her Likability,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803017096?accountid=12768,"With the FBI investigation into her private email server concluded, it is time for the real Hillary Clinton to find her rhythm and her voice. In the history of public-opinion polling, no Democrat has entered the general presidential election with weaker scores on personal popularity, trust or likability than Mrs. Clinton. She has ended up just another policy wonk with a series of different slogans and no central message.
But there is still time for the real Hillary Clinton to emerge and become a strong, popular candidate. To do so, she must return to the basics that have marked her public life and helped her to become the first female to be nominated as the standard-bearer of a major U.S. political party.
Mrs. Clinton's personal qualities and leadership skills are formidable, but her campaign has somehow managed to hide them. When she began her quest for the presidency, her favorable rating was 44% positive and 40% unfavorable. As she clinched the nomination, her favorable rating was 33% positive and 55% unfavorable -- and those unfavorable scores are even higher among white women (57%) and independents (59%). Her trust and likability scores also are upside down, with far more Americans feeling negative than positive toward her.
At what stage does the candidate say to her campaign: ""We are doing something wrong and need to change""? In my opinion, the trust issue cannot be dealt with as a separate element, but must be part of the larger presentation of her total character.
The problem facing Mrs. Clinton is not to find a new Hillary, but to show the true Hillary. No one questions whether she is a skilled politician. What has been lost in this campaign is the approachable person. Her campaign seems to be totally tactical, reactive, and based on her opponent and the issues of the moment.
Here are three suggestions for her to consider in overcoming the negative images she has accumulated over the course of her campaign:
-- Reveal your compassionate side. In your campaign, you have shown mettle, but you have lost your warmth and charm. Voters want to break through and get to know you. When you meet with a small group of people and talk about their problems or hug a young girl who has been bullied, you connect more personally than any of the campaign's four-point policy plans ever could. There is much to be revealed -- not about the substantive issues, but about Hillary Clinton. The vote for president is the most personal vote that Americans cast, and a party platform is much less important than changing Americans' attitudes from negative to neutral or even positive.
-- Show your leadership skills. Voters have no sense of your special leadership abilities. As secretary of state, you appealed to Americans not because of the miles you traveled, but because of the issues you fought for and the alliances you helped make. Your personal favorability score back then was 59%. The country is ready to end Washington gridlock, and you proved your ability to work across the aisle in the Senate and across the world at the State Department, with friends and foes -- but nobody knows this.
-- Be bolder and more focused. You began your career standing for principles and positions that weren't popular, like health-care reform, but they were the right ones and many of them were considered controversial. Yet your presidential campaign seems too finely calibrated to your opponent or to public opinion on issues like the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact or the Keystone XL oil pipeline. There are too many words and too many issues, and in the end there is no message. ""Hillary for America"" and ""stronger together"" are themes that say nothing. From John F. Kennedy's ""get America moving again"" to Barack Obama's ""hope and change,"" a good campaign is captured by a strong half-dozen or fewer words. Find yourself, be yourself and show yourself.
Every good political pro will tell you that this election is about making it a two-person race and showing why you are better than Donald Trump. I don't disagree, but I think you will improve your odds if the voters find a reason to appreciate you, to like you, and to want to vote for you and not just against your opponent. The problem with the better-than-the-alternative approach is that it will hardly move your negative ratings, and then you are totally dependent upon elements you cannot control -- events and your opponent's performance.

Trumped!: Candidate Was Clinton Fan in 2008,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803009399?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is attacking Hillary Clinton these days, but eight years ago, in the midst of the 2008 Democratic primary race, he said she would ""make a good president"" and a lot of people thought pairing her with Barack Obama would be a ""dream ticket.""
His kind words for Mrs. Clinton came in a previously unreported clip from ""Trumped!,"" a syndicated radio feature that aired from 2004 to 2008 and consisted of a daily commentary of about 60 seconds from the real-estate mogul.
On the radio feature, a little-known chapter in Mr. Trump's media career, he presented his thoughts about everything from tattoos -- he didn't like them -- to Michael Jackson's child-molestation trial, in which he sided with the late pop star.
His comments were sometimes light-hearted, but Mr. Trump also weighed in on politics and policy matters, illuminating how some of his views have evolved or reversed since he began his presidential run.
The Wall Street Journal tracked down a handful of ""Trumped!"" audio clips -- fast-paced affairs that start with his signature ""Money, Money, Money, Money"" theme music. It also located nearly 200 full and partial transcripts of the radio commentaries on archived webpages. Over the four years, Mr. Trump would have made about 1,000 radio appearances, based on his schedule.
Until now, none of the audio clips have surfaced publicly during the campaign. ""I've had every news outlet you can imagine wanting to talk,"" said Mary Jo DiLonardo, the radio feature's executive producer, who added she had no copies.
Premiere Networks, a unit of iHeartMedia Inc., which syndicated the show, said it didn't own the copyright and referred questions to Mr. Trump's campaign. Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to questions about the broadcast.
In comments that presage recent controversies over Mr. Trump's attitude toward women, he suggested in the radio commentaries that marriage made a pop star less sexy, expressed incredulity over a college chastity club and said he was surprised to hear that most women disapproved of one-night stands. ""I thought today's women were independent and had a lot of sexual freedom,"" he said in April 2006. ""Well, I guess they fooled me.""
As a candidate, Mr. Trump has offered shifting proposals to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. and expressed concern that some immigrants might want to bring Islamic Shariah law to the U.S.
In one 2008 segment of ""Trumped!,"" Mr. Trump recounted the story of a Saudi man who obtained a divorce outside the courts on the grounds that his wife had been alone with a man -- a presenter she watched on television.
""There are a lot of male chauvinists in this country who really agree with what's going on over there,"" Mr. Trump said in a clip. ""Men in Saudi Arabia have the authority to divorce their wives without going to the courts. I guess that would also mean they don't need prenuptial agreements."" Added the twice-divorced Mr. Trump: ""No courts, no judges. Saudi Arabia sounds like a very good place to get a divorce.""
In the early 2008 broadcast on Mrs. Clinton, aired as she and Mr. Obama still were dueling for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Trump said that ""at least one member of [Mr. Obama's] team said Clinton would make a good vice president. Well, I know her, and she'd make a good president or a good vice president.""
He continued: ""A lot of people think a Clinton/Obama or Obama/Clinton pairing would be a dream ticket in November."" Mr. Trump's prior support for Mrs. Clinton is well known. He donated to her 2008 campaign and has backed other Democrats at times. He has said that as a New York businessman, he needed to curry favor with his senator.
Their relationship predated her time in the Senate, however. In his 1997 ""The Art of the Comeback,"" Mr. Trump included a photo of Mrs. Clinton with him and his sons and called her ""a wonderful woman who has handled pressure incredibly well.""
On the radio, Mr. Trump in 2005 praised New York Democrat Charles Schumer as a ""great senator"" who had ""a lot of common sense,"" according to an archived webpage. He backed Mr. Schumer's criticism of a policy, then just reversed, that led to states reimbursing paroled rapists and sex offenders for Viagra.
""Trumped!,"" which Mr. Trump recorded from his desk, was carried on several hundred stations. ""I'm going to be joining you weekdays from my office in Trump Tower,"" he said in an audio promo. ""It's my window on the world where I see everything, hear everything, and I'll dish it out.""
Make sure to listen, he said, ""or you're fired,"" in an allusion to his reality-TV show ""The Apprentice."" He frequently devoted radio airtime to discussing his contestants. He also dispensed business advice and expounded on social issues.
Mr. Trump in a 2008 radio commentary opposed a West Virginia move to allow hunting-education classes in schools. Taking the same position as gun-control advocates, he called it a ""dangerous risk,"" according to an audio copy obtained by the Journal, and said: ""We hear way too many stories about school violence, so the thought of voluntarily putting guns in the classroom seems like a really bad plan.""
As a candidate, Mr. Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has taken a strong gun-rights stance. He said earlier this year that ""trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms."" He called for elimination of some gun-free zones near schools, scaling back a pledge to abolish them.
A frequent topic of the radio broadcasts was sex and women. In one segment, Mr. Trump advised men to do more chores around the house because psychological research showed they would get more sex from their wives. Commenting on women in the workplace in another segment, he said he had ""very attractive"" women working for him, but ""they wouldn't be there if they couldn't do their jobs very well.""
In March 2005, he said the recently wed Britney Spears had fallen off a ""sexiest women"" list after rating No. 1 the prior year. ""She has gone down, there's no question about it,"" he said. ""That's what a marriage can do for you."" Mr. Trump rated the sexiness of female celebrities in an April 2006 segment. Actress Keira Knightley was ""unbelievable""; tennis star Maria Sharapova was ""truly unbelievable.""
He devoted a September 2004 segment to the partisanship of sexual prowess, highlighting findings that didn't favor the GOP. ""Who has more fun than blondes?"" he asked, according to one partial transcript. ""Democrats, if you believe a new poll. Are Democrats really better in the bedroom?"" He was referring to a poll by Match.com in which respondents overwhelmingly thought Democrats were better lovers than Republicans.
He also dished out advice. Discussing race-car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr., who had taken flak for cursing on television, Mr. Trump offered, ""I guess every once in a while you say things that maybe you shouldn't.""

Obama Says Clinton Is Ready for the Job --- Campaign hopes the president can help rally Democratic voters to her side,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801730331?accountid=12768,"CHARLOTTE, N.C.--President Barack Obama delivered a rousing endorsement of Hillary Clinton's character and abilities on Tuesday, just hours after the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation sharply criticized her handling of classified emails while she served as his secretary of state.
In their first joint appearance on the campaign trail, the president showered praise on his onetime rival, hoping his rebounding popularity and strength on the stump will help give Mrs. Clinton the job he denied her eight years ago.
He also mocked Republican Donald Trump as a reality TV star who doesn't understand the consequences of his words--or the enormity of the decisions that a president must make. Mrs. Clinton, he said, has been tested.
""My faith in Hillary Clinton has always been rewarded. I have had a front-row seat to her judgment and her toughness,"" the president told the crowd at the Charlotte Convention Center. ""There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary Clinton--ever. And that's the truth. That's the truth.""
The event also underscored the tough road Mrs. Clinton faces in trying to succeed a two-term president of her own party. One message from the event was that her election as president would amount to an extension of Mr. Obama's legacy and priorities on a range of issues such as immigration and the economy, areas where the president has often faced stiff opposition from Republicans.
At a campaign event in Raleigh, N.C., on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said he watched some of Mr. Obama's remarks, and said the message of the visit was clear--that a Clinton White House would continue the Obama administration's failed foreign policy and health-care law. ""It's going to be four more years of the same thing,"" he said.
In her remarks, which served as an introduction for Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton heaped praise on the president and tied her own campaign to his in 2008. Referring to the nation's founders, she said, ""Nobody who looked like Barack Obama or me would have been included back then. But we're here today because the story of America is the story of hard-fought, hard-won progress.""
The Clinton campaign had hoped the trip would mark a significant moment and boost for her campaign. In fact, it threatened to be overshadowed by the FBI's Tuesday morning that it would in connection with Mrs. Clinton's , despite what it found to be ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information.
En route to Charlotte, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sidestepped questions about whether Mr. Obama agreed with the FBI's assessment and repeated that the White House wasn't involved in the investigation.
In their remarks in Charlotte on Tuesday, neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Obama addressed the email probe findings.
In their back-to-back speeches, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama spoke of how their 2008 primary contest gave way to a partnership, and then friendship, after Mr. Obama named her his first secretary of state.
Mr. Obama said his respect for Mrs. Clinton deepened during their hard-fought 2008 primary contest, as he came to know her as a fighter for her values and a tough worker who doesn't quit. He also attempted to address her critics, saying her scars reflect a lifetime of battle for her ideals.
""Can I be blunt?"" Mr. Obama asked the crowd. ""Hillary's got her share of critics. That's what happens when you're somebody who's actually in the arena. That's what happens when you've fought for what you believe in.""
He offered some further bluntness when he suggested that she's been hurt because Americans ""like new things,"" something Mrs. Clinton, on the national stage for a quarter century, is not. He said that this very dynamic benefitted him in 2008. ""They said, `oh, he's new!'""
""Sometimes we take someone who's been in the trenches and fought the good fight, and been steady, for granted,"" he said, adding that Americans seem to want a freshness in presidents that they don't demand in pilots or surgeons. As for Mr. Trump, he said, """"This is not a reality show. This is reality.""
Mr. Obama's arrival on the campaign trail marked a rarity in presidential politics: He is the first incumbent president to actively campaign for his party's next nominee in more than a half-century.
That is partly because incumbents often bring political baggage that their would-be successors would rather avoid, and at the start of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, many wondered if she would try to separate herself from the president. Winning a third term for the same party is a daunting challenge infrequently achieved and standing beside the president may suggest that her election amounts to a third term for Mr. Obama.
But with few exceptions, Mrs. Clinton has held the president tight, leaning heavily on their personal relationship and repeatedly vowing to carry on his agenda on health care, immigration, Wall Street regulation and more. That strategy helped her win her primary race against Sen. Bernie Sanders, in particular racking up large wins with African-American voters, which were critical to her victory.
Mr. Obama's approval ratings have crept back into positive territory in recent months, and stand much higher than President George W. Bush's ratings at the similar point of his administration. In 2008, Mr. Bush was so unpopular that GOP nominee John McCain was seen with him only twice--for a Rose Garden endorsement and then for less than one minute on an airport tarmac.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton traveled to Charlotte together aboard Air Force One. Mr. Earnest suggested they might have discussed running-mate options and other campaign affairs along the way. ""I would not be surprised if they do have an opportunity to discuss the ongoing a campaign. Secretary Clinton has lots of people who have good intentions who can offer her solid political advice. The president is among them,"" he said.
The pair had originally planned to appear together last month in Wisconsin, a state Mr. Obama won twice and whose primary Mrs. Clinton lost. If Mr. Trump were to win in November, his path would likely run through the industrial Midwest, so the Clinton campaign sees an imperative to ensuring that Wisconsin stays Democratic.
The June event was canceled in the aftermath of , and then rescheduled for North Carolina, a signal that the Clinton campaign is feeling better about its chances in Wisconsin. Mr. Obama narrowly won North Carolina in 2008 but lost, again narrowly, in 2012.
Recent public polls in North Carolina show a close race, with Democrats having a narrow edge in November.
But Republicans head into the fall with wins in recent years--gaining control of the state Legislature in 2010, the governor's mansion in 2012 and both U.S. Senate seats in 2014.
""Can Hillary Clinton win? Absolutely,"" said Chris Sinclair, a GOP strategist who formerly advised Gov. Pat McCrory. ""Is she a shoo-in? No. She's not liked almost as much as Donald Trump.""
Mr. Trump's nomination has been greeted coolly by some conservatives in the state, where he carried the March GOP primary by one of his smallest margins, barely topping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. North Carolina GOP leaders have been slow to warm to him.
Carter Wrenn, a Republican strategist who led statewide campaigns for Ronald Reagan and Jesse Helms, said he is not sure who to vote for in November. ""I'm sort of like a lot of other Republicans,"" he said. ""I can't possibly support Hillary, but I'm not crazy about Trump."" When asked what he plans to do, Mr. Wrenn sighed. ""Wait for revelation?""

"FBI: Clinton 'Careless,' Not Criminal",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801724498?accountid=12768,"The head of the FBI on Tuesday recommended against charging Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information while she was secretary of state, even as he harshly criticized the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for being ""extremely careless"" with the nation's secrets.
In a at Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters, James Comey said ""any reasonable person"" in Mrs. Clinton's position should have known the sensitive material involved merited greater security. The announcement ended a lengthy investigation of Mrs. Clinton's for government work.
""Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" Mr. Comey said.
The recommendation against charges was a relief to the Clinton campaign and came a week of Mrs. Clinton involving the 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya. Top Justice Department officials still must make the final decision on whether to charge Mrs. Clinton, but Mr. Comey's views will carry great weight. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said she would follow the recommendations of the FBI and career prosecutors.
""We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate,"" the Clinton campaign said. ""As the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved.""
Still, the decision against charges isn't likely to be the final say on the matter as the general-election season heats up. Republicans jumped on the portrait of Mrs. Clinton as reckless with sensitive information, with presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump saying in a statement shortly after Mr. Comey's remarks that ""the system is rigged.""
""The normal punishment, in this case, would include losing authority to handle classified information, and that too disqualifies Hillary Clinton from being president,"" Mr. Trump added.
The email issue has dogged Mrs. Clinton for more than a year following revelations that she routed government correspondence to a server she kept at her home in suburban New York while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Mrs. Clinton said she used the private account because it was more convenient than keeping separate personal and official email addresses.
However, the that Mrs. Clinton's server contained classified material led to a referral to the FBI and the beginning of a criminal investigation into possible loss or mishandling of classified information.
According to the FBI, 110 of the approximately 30,000 emails Mrs. Clinton provided for the investigation contained information considered classified when they were sent. Another 2,000 or so emails were deemed classified after being sent. Among thousands of additional emails Mrs. Clinton hadn't produced but that the FBI had found, three were classified at the time they had been sent, Mr. Comey said. There was no evidence Mrs. Clinton intentionally deleted those emails to hide them from investigators, he added.
There were ""only a very small number"" of emails that bore markings indicating the presence of classified information, said the FBI director. ""But even if information is not marked 'classified' in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it,"" he said, taking on a point Mrs. Clinton had long made in defense of her email arrangement. The former secretary of state had repeatedly asserted that none of the emails in her account contained ""classified"" markings.
The FBI found no evidence that hostile actors successfully broke into Mrs. Clinton's emails. But Mr. Comey said the bureau couldn't rule it out, given that her use of private email was well-known, the email accounts of some of her associates were hacked, and she used her email extensively while overseas.
""Given that combination of factors, we assess that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account,"" he said.
Mr. Comey said actions like Mrs. Clinton's if there is evidence that someone intentionally mishandled information, obstructed justice or appeared to be disloyal to the U.S.
None of those factors was present here, he said. ""We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts,"" Mr. Comey said.
The FBI director did say that individuals who engage in such actions could face administrative penalties.
The FBI concluded its investigation under something of a cloud since Mrs. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, met last week with Ms. Lynch on her plane. Members of both political parties because Ms. Lynch oversees the FBI, and the encounter could suggest Mr. Clinton was seeking to influence the investigation's outcome.
Both participants said they engaged only in small talk. Still, Ms. Lynch later said she regretted the meeting. Mrs. Clinton's supporters noted that officials had signaled long before the meeting that charges were unlikely.
Mrs. Clinton was interviewed at the FBI's Washington headquarters on Saturday, in one of the final steps in the investigation.
Mr. Comey Tuesday stressed that the investigation had been apolitical and that his recommendation was made without outside influence.
He described a painstaking probe requiring thousands of hours of work, citing for example the need to examine emails from a personal server of Mrs. Clinton's that had been decommissioned in 2013.
""It was like removing the frame from a huge finished jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor,"" Mr. Comey said. ""The effect was that millions of email fragments end up unsorted in the server's unused--or 'slack'--space. We searched through all of it.""
He began his statement by announcing that no one at the Justice Department or any other government agency knew what he was about to say.
Such pronouncements didn't ease the concerns of Republicans, who suggested the recommendation was politically influenced. ""This announcement defies explanation,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) said he would press Mr. Comey to disclose the evidence the FBI had gathered in the investigation.
that the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's emails was focusing on a series of emails between State Department diplomats in Pakistan and their superiors in Washington regarding drone strikes in that country.
Those emails were sent on an unclassified system as part of an arrangement that gave the State Department a limited window of opportunity to raise objections to specific Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes.
Officials said most State Department messages about impending drone strikes were sent on a classified system. But on a few occasions, when the diplomats didn't have ready access to the classified system, they used unclassified email to tell each other whether they ""concurred"" or ""non-concurred"" with a specific drone operation.
The language in the emails in question was vague, law-enforcement and congressional officials said, omitting mention of drones or any other specifics.
Some of those emails were subsequently forwarded by State Department officials to Mrs. Clinton on her private server, according to the officials. These were among the emails cited Tuesday by Mr. Comey as ""top secret,"" the officials said.

Clinton's Negatives Complicate Ties Down the Ballot,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801516657?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton will campaign alongside Barack Obama in North Carolina on Tuesday of the election season, expecting a boost from a sitting president whose popularity is strong among the sorts of voters Democrats need to turn out in the battleground state.
Less clear is whether Mrs. Clinton can offer the same sort of lift for fellow Democrats in tough races of their own.
An offshoot of Mrs. Clinton's low favorability rating is that candidates who tie themselves to her risk alienating voters they need to win, polling shows.
A survey last month asked whether people would be more inclined to vote for a Democratic candidate who endorsed Mrs. Clinton's presidential bid. Some 32% said they would be less likely to vote for that candidate, while only 15% said they would be more inclined. More than half said the endorsement wouldn't matter either way.
In a dozen battleground states--including North Carolina--voters by a 13-point margin would be less inclined to vote for candidates who endorse Mrs. Clinton, the Journal/NBC poll showed. Among independent voters, just 4% said they would be more apt to vote for candidates who support Mrs. Clinton, while 38% would be less inclined.
So it's not an easy call to share a stage with the presumptive Democratic nominee in states that are up for grabs in November, analysts say. When Mrs. Clinton made a campaign stop in Raleigh, N.C., on June 22, neither Democratic gubernatorial candidate Roy Cooper nor Senate hopeful Deborah Ross showed up for the rally. Both cited scheduling conflicts.
Both Ms. Ross and Mr. Cooper are planning to attend the event in Charlotte with Mrs. Clinton and the president, who is especially popular among African-American voters. Blacks constituted about one-third of the electorate in the North Carolina Democratic primary in March.
""We have a sizable African-American population, and it's important for any Democrat running statewide that they turn out. There's no one more capable of doing that than the president,"" said Andrew Taylor, a political-science professor at North Carolina State University.
A Clinton campaign spokesman, Jesse Ferguson, said that while ""every candidate has to run their own campaign,"" the presumptive nominee ""is proud to partner with Democrats in North Carolina.""
Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, is an even riskier candidate for state and local GOP candidates to endorse, polling shows. Some 40% of voters said they would be less inclined to vote for a Republican candidate who endorsed Mr. Trump, the Journal poll showed, while only 16% said they would be more likely to back the candidate. An additional 43% said the endorsement would have no impact.
Such numbers are rooted in the unusually poor public images of both party's presumptive nominees, polling experts said. Going back to 1992, no major party nominee as high as the two 2016 candidates. As of last month, 55% had an unfavorable view of Mrs. Clinton; 60%, Mr. Trump.
""Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have a similar negative impact for other candidates on the ballot,"" said Micah Roberts, a Republican who helped conduct the Journal/NBC survey along with Democratic pollster Fred Yang. ""It's very important, and it's something both sides of the aisle are struggling with.""
has been a continuing project since she first arrived on the national stage in 1992.
Assessing her public image, she said last week in Chicago that she isn't happy to hear that people don't trust her. ""I personally know I have work to do on this front,"" she said. She blamed political opponents and ""conspiracy theorists"" for distorting her image but conceded she understands ""trust has to be earned.""
Peter Hart, a longtime Democratic polling expert, said this month's Philadelphia convention is a marquee forum for her campaign to show a side of Mrs. Clinton that people find more appealing. That, in turn, could make it more advantageous for Democratic candidates to bind themselves to her candidacy.
""The campaign just has to shift gears in terms of how she's being portrayed and how she's seen,"" Mr. Hart said. He talked about how a professional actor's image can be improved with proper lighting and different makeup. ""There's nothing wrong with her. It's just the Hillary Clinton we're seeing is not a very attractive Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Hart added.

Jim Comey's Clinton Standard,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801724459?accountid=12768,"For our money, the most revealing words in FBI Director James Comey's statement Tuesday explaining his decision not to recommend prosecuting Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information were these: ""This is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions.""
So there it is in the political raw: One standard exists for a Democratic candidate for President and another for the hoi polloi. We're not sure if Mr. Comey, the erstwhile Eliot Ness, intended to be so obvious, but what a depressing moment this is for the American rule of law. No wonder so many voters think Washington is rigged for the powerful.
***
Mr. Comey spent nearly all of his media appearance laying out the multiple ways in which Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server for official State Department business had violated official policy and jeopardized America's secrets. Yet at the end he declined to recommend prosecution because her behavior was merely ""extremely careless"" rather than ""grossly negligent"" as the law requires. This is a rhetorical distinction without a difference that deserves to be mocked.
Mr. Comey's facts grossly--if we may use that word--belie his conclusion. Of the 30,000 work-related emails Mrs. Clinton turned over to State, 110 contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight email chains contained information judged to be Top Secret. The FBI also found three emails containing classified information among emails that Mrs. Clinton had deleted (rather than turned over to State)--but which the FBI was able to find through forensic analysis.
The FBI chief's statement also had the effect of exposing the many lies Mrs. Clinton has told about her emails.
* Mrs. Clinton claimed she ""did not email any classified material"" over her private email. Mr. Comey refuted this with precise numbers.
* She said her private server was permitted under State policy. Mr. Comey said ""none of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system.""
* She said the emails she sent or received weren't ""marked"" classified. Mr. Comey said that, marked or not, ""participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.""
* Mrs. Clinton said she used personal email merely for the ""convenience"" of using one device. Mr. Comey revealed that she had ""used numerous mobile devices to view and send email on that personal domain"" as well as numerous servers.
* Mrs. Clinton claimed she turned over all work-related email to State. Mr. Comey said the FBI found ""several thousand"" work-related emails that were not turned over. He also dropped the astonishing news that Mrs. Clinton's lawyers hadn't even read her emails when deciding what to turn in. They relied on ""header information"" and search terms, and then ""cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery.""
* Mrs. Clinton claimed her email was stored in a safe and secure manner, and not hacked. Mr. Comey said ""hostile actors"" had accessed the private account of ""people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account."" Her personal email was known about and ""readily apparent.""
He said she ""used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries."" Therefore, he added, ""it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account.""
Despite this list of indictable particulars, Mr. Comey concluded that none of it warrants a criminal prosecution. His justification is that her behavior didn't meet the standard of ""clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice.""
Yet the recent State Department Inspector General report disclosed emails showing that Mrs. Clinton and her staff were warned by State officials that her private email was vulnerable to hackers. She willfully and intentionally ignored those warnings. Mr. Comey knows that many federal employees have been prosecuted for mishandling classified information despite no evidence of ill intent. They were prosecuted merely for recklessly handling secrets. (See Michael Mukasey nearby.)
By a reasonable person's standards, Mrs. Clinton's decision to use a private server, to give her aides access to it, to email classified information on it, to fail to secure it, and to use it in hostile territory was grossly negligent. We can't wait for the next minion prosecuted for mishandling secrets to invoke the ""extremely careless"" defense.
***
Mr. Comey justified what he called his ""unusual statement"" in the name of political ""transparency."" But by declaring that no prosecutor should indict Mrs. Clinton, he also hurt the cause of political accountability. The decision to indict or not rests with prosecutors, not the FBI, as Mr. Comey noted. But now prosecutors can merely point to Mr. Comey's public statement to justify taking no action. He could have passed on his evidence quietly, but instead he acted like a prosecutor while denying that he is one.
It is true that prosecutors must consider the context when deciding whether to press charges. But we wonder if Mr. Comey and the FBI would have shown the same forbearance had the target of their probe been someone less prominent or loved by the Washington establishment. Mr. Comey's bosom friend, Patrick Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor he named to pursue Scooter Libby, showed no such restraint.
Most distressing is what this episode augurs for another Clinton Administration. Mrs. Clinton deliberately sought to evade the Federal Records Act, recklessly flouted laws on handling classified information, spent a year lying about it, and will now have escaped accountability. This will confirm the Clinton family habit, learned so painfully in the 1990s, that they can get away with anything if they deny it long enough and are protected by a friendly media and political class.
The rule of law requires its neutral application. We almost wish Mr. Comey had avoided his self-justifying, have-it-both-ways statement and said bluntly that he couldn't indict Mrs. Clinton because the country must be spared a Donald Trump Presidency. It would have been more honest and less corrosive to democracy than his Clinton Standard.",2016-09-30
Clinton Makes the FBI's Least-Wanted List,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801724419?accountid=12768,"Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey opened and closed his statement to the press Tuesday with expressions of gratitude and pride to be associated with the bureau. His description of FBI agents' work on the Hillary Clinton email investigation showed why he feels that way. Whether the rest of his statement--explaining why he wasn't recommending prosecution of Mrs. Clinton--should make the feeling mutual is an open question.
The agents had to reconstruct thousands of emails from a series of private servers used and abandoned over the years, some of them turned into confetti in the process. The FBI agents also had to tease out from the files of other government employees emails that they might have received from or sent to Mrs. Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state, and weigh their importance.
Unlike Mrs. Clinton's own lawyers--who decided which emails to produce by reading just the headings--the agents read each of the many thousands of emails and fragments that passed through their hands. The job was made no easier by the decision of those lawyers to obliterate the email record they had examined, making it impenetrable to forensic examination. All in all, these tasks of the agents bear comparison with the labors of Hercules.
Moreover, that the FBI seems to have limited its inquiry to the two federal criminal statutes mentioned in Mr. Comey's statement appears entirely reasonable. The level of intent and specificity necessary to prove purposeful intent to destroy government records, or intent to obstruct justice--even assuming such activity was afoot--would have required testimony by an actively cooperating participant. Plainly, no such cooperation was forthcoming.
That left the two statutes discussed in Mr. Comey's statement--one a felony, the other a misdemeanor--and here the announced decision is harder to understand.
It is a felony for anyone entrusted with lawful possession of information relating to national defense to permit it, through ""gross negligence,"" to be removed from its proper place of custody and disclosed. ""Gross negligence"" rather than purposeful conduct is enough. Yet Mr. Comey appears to have based his recommendation not to prosecute on the absence of ""clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information""--though he did say in the same sentence that there was ""evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.""
As an example of the kind of information at stake, he described seven email chains classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level. These were the emails that the government had said earlier are so sensitive that they will never be disclosed publicly. Mr. Comey went further, citing ""evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position . . . should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation."" To be ""extremely careless"" in the handling of information that sensitive is synonymous with being grossly negligent.
And what of the finding that the investigation did not disclose ""clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information""? Even the felony statute requires no such evidence, and no such intent.
The misdemeanor involves simply the knowing removal of classified documents to an unauthorized location. That is the statute to which David Petraeus, the former U.S. Army general and Central Intelligence Agency director, pleaded guilty in 2015. (He had disclosed classified documents to his biographer/mistress, who also had top-secret clearance, returned the information to him and never disclosed it in his biography or elsewhere.)
Mr. Comey mentioned three considerations prosecutors weigh in considering charges: the strength of the evidence, ""especially regarding intent""; ""the context of a person's actions""; and ""how similar situations have been handled in the past.""
Criminal intent of the usual sort, as noted, is not a requirement of either statute.
The only reference to context in the statement--other than repeated references to the extreme secrecy of the information--is the disclosure that the ""security culture"" of the State Department pertaining to email in particular was ""generally lacking in the kind of care . . . found elsewhere in the government."" If that is meant to suggest that Mrs. Clinton was the victim of a bad culture, it seems fair to point out that she headed the agency where it existed.
The ""similar situations in the past"" in which prosecutions were brought were said to be limited to those involving ""clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information"" or ""vast quantities"" of information disclosed with an inference of intent; or evidence of disloyalty or obstruction of justice.
Gen. Petraeus's case included messages showing he knew that the information was being mishandled, and initial misrepresentations to the FBI, although neither is required under the misdemeanor statute. And although the FBI may not have been involved, there are indeed reported felony prosecutions of soldiers for putting copies of classified documents in a gym bag and then not returning them out of fear of discovery; placing classified documents in a friend's desk drawer and forgetting them; tossing documents meant to be destroyed in a dumpster rather than in the appropriate facility.
The FBI director said the investigation of Mrs. Clinton was a case for ""unusual transparency,"" and the transparency in Tuesday's exercise was certainly unusual. Mr. Comey's disclosure of his recommendation outside the context of any discussion with Justice Department lawyers was anomalous. What is supposed to happen in a matter like this is, as the director mentioned, a ""prosecutive"" decision--i.e., a decision made by prosecutors. It is not an investigative decision. Investigators are supposed principally to gather facts.
Mr. Comey didn't explain why, with evidence clearly fulfilling the requirements of the two statutes involved, no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case--except for the director's inaccurate assertion that it had never been done before.
And finally, although there was transparency about process, there was no discussion of underlying facts, only conclusions. It may be that some day there will be the usual transparency: disclosure of facts. That day was not Tuesday, and it is little wonder that many in and out of government were left both puzzled and dismayed.

Political Reporters' Hobgoblin; Trump and Clinton are inconsistent. So what? It's naive to expect otherwise.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825134096?accountid=12768,"'A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."" So wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay ""Self-Reliance."" Since Emerson himself was perhaps the least consistent of writers, often saying one thing in one place and its opposite in another, the remark bears the unmistakable stamp of self-justification. I haven't for a long while wandered through the journals, letters, sermons and other writing of this most overrated of American scribblers, but I shouldn't be in the least surprised to discover that somewhere Emerson also wrote that consistency is the hallmark of large minds.
I have been thinking of that Emerson sentence a fair amount of late when watching television political reporters, anchors, commentators--Chuck Todd, Bret Baier, John Dickerson and others--interview politicians, their managers and so-called party strategists. Increasingly these interviews center on the search for inconsistencies (more precisely, contradictions). How do the politicians' current views compare with the views they held earlier in their careers? Or, in the case of our current presidential candidates, the views they held as recently as two or three days ago? By this ploy, television reporters attempt to demonstrate that politicians, like rubber sandals, flip-flop. But to what avail? The law of contradiction, after all, is not enforceable; if it were the jails would overflow.
In the instances of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, it is scarcely surprising that contradictions pop up with the regularity of fleas on a junkyard dog. Both are what I should call Kentucky-windage politicians: Without genuine beliefs, each always checks which way the wind--that is, voter sentiment--is blowing before firing away.
It is naive to expect consistency from politicians, to say nothing of devotion to principles, and more than naive to think that catching their contradictions will slow them down in any significant way. With votes at stake, with polls changing almost hourly, it is only natural that politicians and their close supporters provide a nearly endless stream of pronunciamentos rife with contradictions.
What does a reporter gain in confronting politicians with their inconsistencies? Pointing out to a politician that he claimed to be for this or that program in 2009 and now he claims to be against it is roughly as telling a criticism as informing a streetwalker that her hem is perhaps a touch too high. Do political commentators truly expect politicians, when confronted with evidence of their contradictions, to respond, ""You're right. You know, I never thought of that.""
I've long held that the world's dumbest question, asked repeatedly by female reporters on the sidelines after sporting events, is ""What was on your mind when . . . [fill in the event]?"" A truthful answer is probably that the athlete knew once the game ended he would have to face the inanity of the question of what was on his mind and have an answer ready.
Catching out a politician in a contradiction may be an even more empty exercise. Politicians never admit it. Instead, they waffle, they wobble, they claim to have been misunderstood, they bob and weave and artfully dodge the charge. Donald Trump and the dreary birther question is a case in point. Yes, the Trump camp avers, he may have doubted Barack Obama's birth. But they add that the lubricious Sidney Blumenthal started the rumor that the president wasn't born in this country when Mrs. Clinton ran against Mr. Obama in 2008.
Even if politicians could be got to admit the contradictory nature of their current with their former views, would it really matter? Who knows: In their defense they might even cite the stale Emerson quotation.
Rather than cite contradictions, which abound without ultimate significance, television reporters would be much more useful if they put politicians' and candidates' feet to the fire on views they currently claim to hold. They might ask Mr. Trump how, precisely, he plans to restore American military might and at what cost, or by what means he thinks he can defeat ISIS. He has been claiming for months now that he can easily do both without anyone pressing him on these matters.
They might ask Mrs. Clinton, who is keen on aligning herself with the Black Lives Matter movement, for her thoughts on the vast number of black-on-black killings that now number in the tens of thousands in the black ghetto neighborhoods, and whether Black Lives Matter doesn't actually deflect attention from this much more serious problem.
They might ask politicians who have served more than two terms in the Senate or six in the House how they happen to have become multimillionaires on their relatively modest political salaries. There is no want of good questions to ask politicians--none of which begin, ""In 2011 you said . . .""

Election 2016: Clinton Opens Up to Build Voter Trust,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804473090?accountid=12768,"Most comfortable in the realm of policy, Hillary Clinton in recent weeks has been offering some of her most personal self-assessments so far in the campaign as she tries to reassure voters they can trust her in the White House.
Mrs. Clinton has long grappled with voter doubts about her candor and likability, driven partly by revelations that she used a personal email account while serving as secretary of state.
A new poll from the Associated Press-GfK asked how well the word ""honest"" describes Mrs. Clinton. Some 73% replied ""not at all"" or only ""slightly"" well, while 24% said ""somewhat"" or ""very well."" About one-third said ""likable"" was a word that described her somewhat or very well.
In recent appearances, Mrs. Clinton has sought to confront such perceptions head-on. While she still holds that political opponents have tarnished her public image through unfounded attacks, she is also accepting a measure of blame.
She gave a speech in Springfield, Ill. this week in which she acknowledged that in waging a competitive campaign she had contributed to a sense of political ""division"" in the country.
""I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven't sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of our progress,"" she said. ""So I recognize I have to do better, too.""
Speaking in Chicago last month she conceded that people question her trustworthiness and said, ""I've made mistakes."" Though she maintained she has been the target of ""wild accusations"" over the last quarter century, she said: ""I know trust has to be earned.""
Mrs. Clinton also is settling on a consistent message that it was a bad idea to use a private email account at the State Department. Previously, she sought to justify her actions.
One Clinton adviser said the aim is to overcome the skepticism of people who might not like Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump but feel uncomfortable voting for Mrs. Clinton. To that end, she is expressing more contrition, such as in her replies to questions about emails. She makes it a point to open by saying she made a mistake and won't repeat it, the adviser said.
Mr. Trump faces similar doubts. The Associated Press-GfK poll showed that by a margin of nearly three-to-one, people don't see him as likable. About two-thirds said the word ""honest"" fits him only ""slightly"" or ""not at all well.""
Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump in various national polls, but Democratic officials and strategists say she could widen the gap if she can win over voters who don't see her as straightforward.
""It's the elephant in the room and you've got to address it,"" said John Burton, chairman of the California Democratic Party. ""The fact that she's doing this is good.""

Clinton Foundation Amends Its Filing With New York; Move comes day after rival Donald Trump's charitable foundation was told to suspend fundraising in state,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825675967?accountid=12768,"Officials at the foundation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said they filed information Tuesday with the New York attorney general's office that was missing from previous disclosures.
The move comes a day after Republican rival Donald Trump's charitable foundation was told to suspend its fundraising in the state because it violated registration requirements.
A Clinton Foundation spokesman said the charity has complied with New York law, but amended its annual charitable filing with the office of Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, ""out of an abundance of caution."" The group said it would disclose more detailed financial data on its affiliates.
A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said the foundation's filings for at least one year--in 2012--were incomplete. The attorney general's office didn't immediately release the new information provided by the foundation, and it wasn't clear whether it included additional audited information about the charity's foreign affiliates.
The foundation's move comes as presidential contenders' philanthropic ventures have come under scrutiny.
Mrs. Clinton's political rivals have questioned the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign government donations, including some that came during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton has denied any conflicts of interest and said she is proud of the foundation's work.
Mr. Schneiderman's office said Monday it is demanding that Donald Trump's charitable foundation suspend fundraising activity in New York, issuing a cease-and-desist letter accusing Mr. Trump's family nonprofit of failing to register as a charity that raises money in the state.
The foundation has 15 days from Sept. 30--the day the notice was dated--to correct its registration and file required paperwork.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said the candidate questioned the political motives of Mr. Schneiderman, who supports Mrs. Clinton, and said the foundation would comply with Mr. Schneiderman's broader investigation into the charity.
The Clinton Foundation has offered to share more details with Mr. Schneiderman's bureau about contributions from foreign governments. But a spokesman for the foundation said it hasn't received a request to do so from Mr. Schneiderman's office.
New York requires that charitable organizations annually disclose and itemize the dollar amounts of grants made by a ""government agency.""
The attorney general and the Clinton Foundation said they are currently interpreting that rule to be limited to grants from domestic government sources.
The foundation in recent years has disclosed to New York officials its foreign government grants as a lump sum. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, the foundation's largest project, also makes annual financial disclosures to the attorney general, but neither itemizes its foreign government grants nor specifies a summary total dollar figure, a practice scrutinized in a Scripps News report from September.
""CHAI also received foreign government contributions and can provide those in more details if needed,"" the group told the attorney general's office in a letter accompanying its most recent annual filing.
Mr. Schneiderman's office says it has never demanded itemization of foreign government grants, but has said it is considering clarifying its requirements.
Some foundations and charities have itemized foreign government grants in recent annual tax filings, including Family Care International, Action Against Hunger and the George W. Bush Foundation, which reported a $5 million grant from the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia in its 2013 filing.

"Sen. Brown Plans Bill to Ban Forced Arbitration in Wells Fargo Sales Scandal; On campaign trail, Hillary Clinton steps up attack on Wells Fargo and arbitration clauses",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825284942?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) said Monday he plans to introduce a bill to prevent Wells Fargo & Co. from invoking forced arbitration clauses in contracts with customers following the scandal involving unauthorized accounts.
That step would make it easier for customers to sue the bank for any damages they incurred when bank employees opened as many as two million accounts in customers' names without their consent.
Some lawmakers, including Mr. Brown, have criticized Wells Fargo for using legal agreements buried within contracts. The bank can block customers from filing lawsuits for damages incurred by unauthorized accounts, including negative effects on the customers' credit scores and borrowing costs.
Such ""mandatory arbitration"" clauses are controversial but commonly used for financial products and services like bank accounts and credit cards. They are used to force customers into private arbitration when disputes arise, cutting off their ability to file lawsuits that can be certified as class action.
""Giving customers back their right to take Wells Fargo to court gives them the power to ensure they are made whole and helps prevent cases like this in the future,"" Mr. Brown said in a press release. He added that he planned to introduce the legislation when Congress returns from the current recess after the November election.
The trajectory of the bill will be tied closely to the outcome of the elections. The bill would get stronger support if the Democrats regain a majority in the Senate. That would also increase the influence of Mr. Brown, who would then likely head the Senate Banking Committee.
Hillary Clinton also stepped up her criticism of Wells Fargo and arbitration clauses.
""We can't let companies like Wells Fargo use these fine print gotchas to escape accountability,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said Monday in a campaign stop in Toledo, Ohio. Customers, she said, ""are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections you get in a court of law.""
At a House panel hearing on Sept. 29, Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf defended the bank's use of arbitration clauses, saying it is a ""fair way"" to compensate customers for financial damages, and that the bank is paying for mediators for customers who choose to seek arbitration.
The scrutiny over the use mandatory arbitration at Wells Fargo comes as regulators and industry battle over the cost and benefit of such practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which along with other regulators hit Wells Fargo with a $185 million fine for opening nearly two million bank and credit-card accounts without customer consent, proposed a new rule in May banning the use of arbitration clauses in financial products as a way to block class-action lawsuits.
The Department of Health and Human Services in August issued a new rule that will prohibit certain long-term care facilities from forcing residents into arbitration.
Supporters of new restrictions on arbitration rules say they will discourage companies from practices that harm customers. Opponents say arbitration is an easier and cheaper method for customers to resolve disputes, and that new rules would only enrich class-action lawyers.

Clinton Chooses Kaine for VP Spot --- Virginia senator is seen as cautious selection; liberal Democrats had pushed for populist,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806204302?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton named Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine to be her running mate Friday night, turning to a seasoned politician from a battleground state and a figure long seen as the favorite to complete the Democratic presidential ticket.
""Tim is a lifelong fighter for progressive causes and one of the most qualified vice presidential candidates in our nation's history,"" Mrs. Clinton said in an email to supporters a day after GOP nominee Donald Trump scorched her in a speech to the Republican National Convention. On Twitter, she called Mr. Kaine ""a man who's devoted his life to fighting for others.""
Mr. Kaine, also on Twitter, said he couldn't wait to hit the trail with her Saturday in Miami. The senator, 58 years old, is widely considered a safe choice befitting a cautious presumptive nominee, and people close to the campaign have seen him as the front-runner for months. He is broadly respected in the Senate, has a foreign-policy background and is seen by Mrs. Clinton and close aides as a potentially strong partner in governing.
But his selection came as a disappointment to some in the liberal wing of the party. Some Democrats had hoped Mrs. Clinton would turn to a more populist leader, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in an effort to unite the party following a tough primary fight with liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders. Mr. Kaine's positions in favor of trade and other matters leave many progressives cold.
Mrs. Clinton's deliberations for a running mate began in earnest in April, after her win in the New York primary. Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, came to her house in Chappaqua, N.Y. and delivered binders filled with information about two dozen potential vice-presidential nominees. He carried the material in Duane Reade drugstore bags.
A little over a week ago, Mrs. Clinton campaigned with Mr. Kaine in Virginia. Afterward, the two went back to her home in Washington, D.C., for an unscheduled meeting, the campaign aide said. Mrs. Clinton had been impressed with Mr. Kaine's campaign style, the aide said.
The pair were first joined by other aides and then talked one-on-one. Mr. Kaine left her home at 10:30 p.m., after an hour and a half, the aide said. Mrs. Clinton met privately with other vice-presidential candidates at her home in Washington the following day. Later, she told her aides she wanted to meet again with Mr. Kaine.
On Saturday, July 16, Mr. Kaine and his wife returned to Mrs. Clinton's home in Washington for lunch. Also at the table were former President Bill Clinton, her daughter, Chelsea, and her son-in-law, Marc Mezvinsky. Mr. Kaine was the only candidate she invited back for a second meeting, the aide said.
Mrs. Clinton told aides she felt comfortable with Mr. Kaine and had confidence in his abilities.
In making her choice, she gave weight to a piece of advice from Mr. Podesta, a former White House chief of staff to her husband. A vice president, Mr. Podesta said, should be someone who she'd be glad to see when he enters the room and want to be part of ""any conversation.""
The Clinton campaign late Friday released a video showing Mr. Kaine campaigning with Mrs. Clinton last week.
Mr. Kaine was first elected to office -- the Richmond City Council -- in 1994 and went on to serve as mayor and then as Virginia's lieutenant governor. In 2005, he was elected governor, and in 2012, he won his Senate seat.
Mr. Kaine is white, but he could help Mrs. Clinton with minority voters. He took a year off law school to help run a technical school founded by Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. In 2013, he delivered a speech in Spanish on the Senate floor in support of an immigration overhaul. He joined a predominantly African-American Catholic church in Richmond, a majority-black city.
Many Democrats have long assumed Mrs. Clinton would choose Mr. Kaine because of his credentials, her comfort with him and because choosing him comes with few risks.
""I am boring,"" he said on NBC in June, but then joked, ""Boring is the fastest-growing demographic in this country.""
Runners-up for the job were said to be Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.
If elected vice president, Mr. Kaine's successor in the Senate would be appointed by a Democratic governor. That isn't the case with other people Mrs. Clinton considered, including Mr. Booker, Ms. Warren and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown.
One issue for Mrs. Clinton could be winning over liberal voters to the pick. Last year, Mr. Kaine voted to give the president ""fast-track"" authority to smooth passage of a 12-nation trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal opposed by the Democratic base. Mr. Kaine has said free-trade deals can help the economy if negotiated in ways that protect workers' rights.
""He does nothing for [Bernie] Sanders supporters. He does nothing for the young or people of color. He won't help win the white workers devastated by our perverse trade policies,"" said Robert Borosage, co-director of the liberal group Campaign For America's Future. ""He is the choice of a candidate confident of victory who wants a safe VP.""
His position on abortion has drawn some attention as well. He says he is personally opposed to the procedure but has voted in favor of abortion-rights measures.
With Mr. Trump running as the self-described law-and-order candidate, Republicans hope to tar Mr. Kaine for his opposition to the death penalty and cite his pro bono work to try to free two murderers convicted in the 1980s.
The effort will echo Mr. Kaine's 2005 campaign for governor of Virginia, when then state Attorney General Jerry Kilgore used the issue against him. What's new is that GOP researchers have uncovered the argument used by Mr. Kaine as a lawyer: that the death penalty wasn't warranted in one case because the suspect didn't actually rape the 17-year-old victim but instead sodomized her.
""We plan to use this to show his extreme position on criminal-justice issues,"" an RNC official said.
Mr. Kaine drew some early praise from across the aisle late Friday, when Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) said on Twitter that he was ""trying to count the ways"" he hates Mr. Kaine. ""Drawing a blank,"" he wrote. ""Congrats to a good man and a good friend.""
Mr. Kaine grew up in the Kansas City area and worked in his father's ironworking shop. He went on to Harvard Law School, where he met his wife, who serves as Virginia's secretary of education.
The lawmaker, who plays harmonica with bluegrass bands, has occasionally demonstrated his musical skills in the Senate. When the chamber was forced into a rare weekend session in December 2014, Mr. Kaine played his harmonica at dinner while Senate Democrats sang Christmas carols and ate Chinese food.

"Clinton-Keen; Unlike Trump, Pence wouldn't be baited.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825990519?accountid=12768,"By common consensus Mike Pence did well in the vice presidential debate , and many people are saying the man at the top of the GOP ticket, Donald Trump, is none too pleased.
""Pence won overall, but lost with Trump,"" a ""senior Trump adviser"" tells CNBC's John Harwood an hour or so after the debate ended. ""He can't stand to be upstaged."" At roughly the same time, the Puffington Host's Sam Stein tweeted: ""CNN's John King, reporting from a source close to Trump, that the reviews that Pence did better then he did won't go over well with Trump.""
This is pretty thin stuff, is it not? It's based on anonymous sources--or maybe a single source, as it's possible Harwood and King were talking to the same person. It does not appear as if the source or sources were describing Trump's response, only anticipating it; King's source, assuming Stein's paraphrase is accurate (we couldn't find the transcript of postdebate commentary on CNN's website), is explicit on that point.
It falls into the category of amusing gossip--though we suppose it's possible the Trump campaign put it out deliberately in order to set up expectations of an erratic Trump reaction, against which Trump's actual response would look statesmanlike.
And there were no 3 a.m. Trump tweets lashing out at Pence. Just after the debate, he tweeted : ""Mike Pence won big. We should all be proud of Mike!"" Then, at 9:28 a.m. ET today : ""The constant interruptions last night by Tim Kaine should not have been allowed. Mike Pence won big!"" (To be sure, it is funny that Trump would complain about interruptions.)
But Ezra Klein of the young-adult website Vox went with the story in today's early hours:
Here's a question you wouldn't normally have to ask after a vice presidential candidate turned in a widely praised debate performance: Will the presidential nominee completely fly off the handle tomorrow?
But this isn't a normal year. . . .
Trump might respond by patting Pence on the back. A win's a win. Or, as John King and John Harwood's reporting suggests, he might respond with fury. Trump doesn't like to be upstaged. He prizes loyalty above all else. His political style is almost entirely based on asserting dominance over other men.
That was pure speculation, though Trump's initial postdebate tweet, not noted by Klein, supported the pat-on-the-back theory.
Klein's conclusion, though, is priceless, and also emblematic of how journalism has gone badly wrong during this campaign: ""It perhaps bears noting that the fact that these reports are even remotely plausible speaks to the immaturity of the Republican nominee, and his manifest unfitness for office.""
The ""fact"" that the ""reports"" are ""plausible"" is a fact about Klein--he is willing to believe them--not about Trump. According to Klein, his own willingness to believe these unverifiable claims about Trump is evidence that his broader anti-Trump bias is well-founded. We would say his willingness to believe them is part and parcel of his bias.
That said, we would also acknowledge that Trump benefited from his own absence on the debate stage. Like Hillary Clinton in last week's presidential debate, Kaine spent much of his time baiting his counterpart with various accusations (some true, some not) about Trump. Unlike Trump, Pence seldom took the bait, instead turning the discussion to policy or to Mrs. Clinton's manifold corruptions.
It's an example Trump would do well to follow in the remaining two debates, this coming Sunday and two weeks from tonight. Clearly the Clinton-Kaine campaign's strategy for the debates is to keep the focus on Trump's shortcomings, real and alleged, and Trump's defensiveness during the last hour of last week's debate permitted that approach to succeed. When Pence declined to cooperate, Kaine showed no signs of having a Plan B.
We found Pence to be more impressive than any candidate who ran for president this year, in either party. The comparison may be unfair: Pence never had to debate Trump, and the multicandidate primary debate format tends to make everyone look small. But we saw a bit of Reagan in Pence, the white hair notwithstanding. With his calm demeanor and soothingly authoritative voice, he came across as serious and mature.
As for Kaine, he smiled a lot and was full of energy. But he didn't seem cheerful so much as pleased with himself, in the manner of an obsequious schoolboy keen to impress an authority figure. That was especially the case when he got through his set pieces about Trump's taxes and his various outlandish comments.
To which Pence responded with a Reaganesque disdain: ""Did you work on that one a long time?"" he said at one point. ""Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it."" At one point Pence even said, ""There they go again,"" reprising the most famous Reagan line from his 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter. (Reagan delivered it a lot better.)
In July, after Trump named Pence as his running mate, the New York Times published a profile titled ""Mike Pence: A Conservative Proudly Out of Sync With His Times"":
With his formal bearing, shiny helmet of white hair and carefully chosen, slowly delivered words, he is a throwback in his demeanor. With his deep social conservatism, public religiosity and aversion to negative campaigning, he is a throwback in his political style.
We had something of the same feeling as we watched Pence last night, not about his ""social conservatism"" or ""religiosity"" but about his style. He reminded us of a time when candidates for national office, especially Republican ones, affected a serious and thoughtful--critics would say stodgy--demeanor.
On the Republican side, that time wasn't very long ago at all: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan both fit the stereotype. By contrast, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, each in his own way, cultivated a hip, loose rock-star persona. This was the year in which Republican voters yielded to star power. Pence is a comfort to those who don't think that was a good idea.
Metaphor Alert ""[Jon] Stewart likely feared (with some justification) that the flirtation of 'straight' journalism with infotainment would eventually degrade the more serious enterprise. Unfortunately, as cable, satellite, and later the Internet offered an exponential increase of choice in content to viewers, the pressure on every tent to offer its own wild animals and clown cars was probably inevitable. Indeed, by the time Stewart attacked 'Crossfire,' that particular horse had escaped the barn and boarded a ship setting sail on a sea of spilt milk. The name of that ship was the Fox News Channel.""--Warren Henry, Federalist, Oct. 4

Pence repeatedly turned to the camera when he answered questions, making clear he understood that the real audience wasn't in the room but watching on TV. The Indiana governor was calm, cool and collected throughout--a stark contrast to the fast-talking (and seemingly nervous) [Tim] Kaine. . . .
* Orioles vs. Blue Jays: For most of the 95 minutes or so that the debate lasted, it was borderline unwatchable. There was so much cross talk and so little actual question-answering that it felt like watching two kids throw mashed potatoes at each other.
So two kids are throwing mashed potatoes at each other, and one of them is calm, cool and collected. What's wrong with that picture?

Election 2016: Clinton Foundation Amends Its Previous Filing With New York,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825768469?accountid=12768,"Officials at the foundation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said they filed information Tuesday with the New York attorney general's office that was missing from previous disclosures.
The move comes a day after Republican rival Donald Trump's charitable foundation was told to suspend its fundraising in the state because it violated registration requirements.
A Clinton Foundation spokesman said the charity has complied with New York law, but amended its annual charitable filing with the office of Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, ""out of an abundance of caution."" The group said it would disclose more detailed financial data on its affiliates.
A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said the foundation's filings for at least one year -- in 2012 -- were incomplete. After the foundation submitted the additional information on Tuesday, the attorney general's office made it public, showing a more complete breakdown of annual revenues, expenses and liabilities for the foundation and its related entities, including foreign affiliates.
The foundation's move comes as presidential contenders' philanthropic ventures have come under scrutiny.
Mrs. Clinton's political rivals have questioned the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign government donations, including some that came during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton has said there were no conflicts of interest and said she is proud of the foundation.
Mr. Schneiderman's office said Monday it is demanding that Mr. Trump's charitable foundation suspend fundraising activity in New York, issuing a cease-and-desist letter accusing Mr. Trump's family nonprofit of failing to register as a charity that raises money in the state. The foundation has 15 days from Sept. 30 -- the day the notice was dated -- to correct its registration and file required paperwork.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said the candidate questioned the political motives of Mr. Schneiderman, who supports Mrs. Clinton, and said the foundation would comply with Mr. Schneiderman's broader investigation into the charity.
The Clinton Foundation has offered to share more details with Mr. Schneiderman's bureau about contributions from foreign governments. But a spokesman for the foundation said it hasn't received a request to do so from Mr. Schneiderman's office.
New York requires that charitable organizations annually disclose and itemize the dollar amounts of grants made by a ""government agency."" The attorney general and the Clinton Foundation said they are interpreting that rule to be limited to grants from domestic government sources.
The foundation in recent years has disclosed to New York officials its foreign government grants as a lump sum. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, the foundation's largest project, also makes annual financial disclosures to the attorney general, but neither itemizes its foreign government grants nor specifies a summary total dollar figure, a practice scrutinized in a Scripps News report from September.
""CHAI also received foreign government contributions and can provide those in more details if needed,"" the group told the attorney general's office in a letter accompanying its most recent annual filing.

Election 2016: Sanders Endorses Clinton --- Vermont senator acts after his rival moves to the left on several of his key policy issues,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803344234?accountid=12768,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders offered an unequivocal endorsement of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, ending an intense intraparty rivalry amid signs that progressive holdouts are coalescing around the presumptive Democratic nominee for the fall showdown with Republican Donald Trump.
After a protracted duel that divided the Democratic Party between Mrs. Clinton's pragmatic policy proposals and the Vermont senator's more ambitious, left-leaning vision, Mr. Sanders cleared the way for a unified front in the general-election campaign.
""I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing Hillary Clinton and why she must become our next president,"" Mr. Sanders told a crowd that blended supporters of both candidates.
On Tuesday, the Democratic candidates returned to New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders notched his first victory in the primary campaign. He contrasted Mrs. Clinton with Mr. Trump, saying that the presumptive GOP nominee would lower or even abolish the minimum wage, give tax breaks to the rich and appoint Supreme Court justices who would trample on civil liberties.
Mr. Trump has courted Sanders voters in recent weeks, pointing out similarities he sees between them on issues such as trade and the purported rigged nature of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, he took to Twitter to castigate Mr. Sanders. ""I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. ""They are not happy that he is selling out!""
In trying to win Mr. Sanders's backing, Mrs. Clinton in recent weeks rolled out new policies that he had embraced on the campaign trail.
She moved closer to a Sanders plan that would eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities. Mrs. Clinton called for free tuition at public schools for families earning up to $85,000 a year, with the cap rising to $125,000 in five years. Over the weekend, she released a plan to increase spending for community health centers -- a Sanders priority.
Mr. Sanders's show of support came after weeks of negotiations between the two camps. But by the time he endorsed her -- more than a month after his rival essentially clinched the nomination -- many of his supporters already had gotten behind Mrs. Clinton.
Polls show a majority of Sanders backers now support the former secretary of state. And this week, three progressive groups endorsed Mrs. Clinton, signaling they would work to elect her and urging their supporters to do the same.
The question now for Mrs. Clinton is whether the rest of the rank-and-file voters who backed Mr. Sanders fall in line.
On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders highlighted areas of agreement with Mrs. Clinton, ticking through a list of issues where they have found common ground, while also acknowledging sharp differences in their policy agendas.

"GOP Puts Pressure on Clinton, FBI",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802105658?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Republicans moved Wednesday to keep alive a controversy they hope will work to their advantage in the presidential campaign a day after FBI Director James Comey accused Hillary Clinton of being ""extremely careless"" with national secrets.
They called Mr. Comey to testify Thursday before a House panel about his probe of the presumptive Democratic nominee's email practices. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged the FBI to release the full transcript of its questioning of Mrs. Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton has yet to address publicly Mr. Comey's findings, but her campaign is hoping that voters will see Republicans as overreaching, giving her leeway to step up her attacks on Donald Trump's fitness to be president.
Attorney General with no charges being brought against any individual, bolstering the Clinton campaign's argument that it is time to move on and focus on picking the next president.
""For weeks Republicans have said they trusted Mr. Comey to lead an independent review into Secretary Clinton's emails, but now they are second-guessing his judgment because his findings do not align with their conspiracy theories,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said Wednesday.
Mrs. Clinton has made her professionalism and judgment defining credentials. She talks about her ""responsibility gene"" and serious-minded approach to governing. It is an argument that her campaign sees as especially potent given that it sets up a contrast with Mr. Trump, a businessman who has never held public office.
But Mr. Comey's report depicted a secretary of state heedless to foreseeable security risks. Traveling abroad she used her personal account to send and receive emails ""in the territory of sophisticated adversaries,"" Mr. Comey said.
""The whole rationale for her candidacy is that she might not be flashy or exciting, but she's competent and knows what she's doing and will be a steadier hand than Donald Trump,"" said Lis Smith, former spokeswoman for Democrat Martin O'Malley's presidential bid. ""When people like James Comey make these devastating comments about her competence, it should be a big source of concern because it undermines her core rationale,"" she said.
The Trump campaign had been predicting for weeks an indictment of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump declared the system ""rigged"" when that didn't materialize, and he called Mrs. Clinton a ""dirty rotten liar"" in a campaign speech Wednesday in Cincinnati.
Mr. Comey will testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee at 10 a.m. on Thursday, FBI officials confirmed.
Republicans are hoping the FBI report will keep the nation focused on its findings and create a drag on Mrs. Clinton who is leading in many national and battleground polls.
Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump nationally by 46% to 41% in a head-to-head matchup, a recent Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll found.
Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, told reporters Wednesday that he wanted the FBI to release what Mrs. Clinton said in a 3-hour interview on Saturday. ""The next step...is to compare what Hillary Clinton said to the FBI to what Hillary Clinton said to all of us over the last couple of years,"" he said.
Republicans are also likely to try to link the FBI findings with other cases where they claim Mrs. Clinton showed a lack of competence, including her support for U.S. military action in Libya in 2011 and her lead role in calling for a ""reset"" with Russia in 2009.
Some Democrats now fear that the Comey report opens Mrs. Clinton to a new line of attack that cuts to the heart of her candidacy: that she lacks the competence to govern.
Pat Caddell, a top strategist in Democrat Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential bid, said in an interview: ""The competence question--which is her edge over Trump--has got to be damaged by this. It weakens that aspect of her and it opens the door to a lot of other questions about her judgment.""
The Clinton campaign plans to say that a sense of proportion needs to be maintained and that one mistake that she regrets ought not be something that overshadows a record that shows she is a seasoned, experienced hand and probably the most qualified person to run for president that we've seen, a campaign official said.
Campaign officials said Mrs. Clinton will speak about the FBI's findings in the near future. ""She will address it in due time,"" the official said.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton has sought to persevere as the furor plays out.
This week, she shared a stage with President Barack Obama in North Carolina, who vouched for her hard work and good judgment. Vice President Joe Biden is due to campaign with Mrs. Clinton Friday in Scranton, Pa., and deliver similar messages.
And people close to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said they anticipate he will eventually endorse Mrs. Clinton in a move that could help unify the Democratic Party in the run-up to November.
Still, any lingering questions about her fitness for office carry risks for Mrs. Clinton because she has made her preparedness for the presidency a central point of her candidacy, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University.
""What is Hillary Clinton's strongest suit? It's that she's got the best rsum to be president and that she is the epitome of competence,"" Mr. Brinkley said. ""This will be fodder for the GOP to hammer away on.""
The question among some Democrats and Republicans alike is whether Mr. Trump can successfully advance the argument.
Steve Elmendorf, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns who backs Mrs. Clinton, noted that not even Republicans are arguing that Mr. Trump is more competent than the former secretary of state. ""The people who are for Donald Trump have a hard time articulating why they're for Donald Trump,"" he said.
Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster, said Mr. Comey's remarks won't help Mrs. Clinton convince voters that her competence is beyond reproach. But his comments aren't likely to be a fatal blow, either, he said.
""In any other election, having the FBI director accuse a presidential candidate of extreme carelessness would effectively kill their campaign, but this is obviously not any other election,"" Mr. Ayres said. ""It should not be difficult to win that, but Mr. Trump may find it challenging.""

Clinton Casino Royale,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802058250?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton on Wednesday accused Donald Trump of looting his casinos and pillaging Atlantic City, and that was the gracious part. If she's going to criticize Mr. Trump's business record, she should also have to defend the failure of Atlantic City's model of progressive governance.
Democrats aim to rehash the story of how Mr. Trump loaded his casinos with debt and declared bankruptcy four times--stiffing creditors and workers while shielding himself personally--ad nauseam through November. ""He doesn't default and go bankrupt as a last resort,"" Mrs. Clinton declared. ""He does it over and over again on purpose."" She's one to talk about incorrigible behavior.
While Mr. Trump may have contributed to Atlantic City's downward spiral by oversaturating the casino market, it takes more than one man to raze a city. The businessman experienced a moment of lucidity--if only he could expand beyond 140 characters--when he fired back in a tweet that ""Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves--Convention Center, Airport--and destroyed City.""
In 1976 New Jersey voters approved a referendum that legalized gambling in Atlantic City. The constitutional amendment required casino revenues to fund programs for senior citizens and disabled residents, but politicians have instead funneled the cash to favored projects and businesses under the guise of promoting development. Guess how that's turned out?
A 1984 law required casinos to pay 2.5% of gaming revenues to the state or ""reinvest"" 1.25% in tax-exempt bonds issued by the state Casino Reinvestment Development Authority for state and community ""projects that would not attract capital in normal market conditions."" Investment recipients have included Best of Bass Pro shop, Margaritaville and Healthplex.
A decade later, state lawmakers imposed a $1.50 fee (which has since doubled) on casino parking spots to fund Atlantic City transportation, casino construction and a convention center. In 2004 lawmakers added a $3 surcharge for casino hotel stays to finance new hotel rooms and retail establishments, which had the effect of promoting unsustainable commercial and casino development.
Then came gambling competition, in Connecticut in 1992 and Pennsylvania in 2004. As more states in the Northeast legalized gaming, Atlantic City's monopoly withered. In 2014 four Atlantic City casinos shut down even as the state development authority reported $352.2 million in cash and investments and $103.2 million in annual revenues (equal to about a quarter of the city budget).
Irony alert: Mr. Trump in 1997 sued to block the state's redistribution of casino income when a competing developer stood to benefit from its investments. However, New Jersey's liberal Supreme Court ruled that voters should have known that the referendum was actually intended to revitalize Atlantic City tourism, not help seniors.
Employment in Atlantic City has declined by about 10% over the last decade. Since 2010 the city's property tax base has shrunk by two thirds. Local politicians raised property taxes by 50% between 2013 and 2014 to compensate for the dwindling tax base, but this has merely deterred new business investment and propelled flight.
Meantime, local politicians have continued to spend like they work for Google. Between 2010 and 2014, expenditures increased by 10% while government debt doubled. The city government spends about $6,600 a year per resident--more than any other city in the state including Newark ($2,344). Its budget exceeds that of nearly half of New Jersey's counties. Labor costs constitute about 70% of the budget.
Earlier this year, the city emergency manager projected a $393 million cumulative deficit over the next five years absent reforms. More than 100 workers have recently been laid off. In May Democratic legislators and Governor Chris Christie passed a bailout that allows the city to squeeze an additional $120 million out of casinos in revenues annually to compensate for lower property-tax revenue.
To sum up: New Jersey Democrats plundered Atlantic City casinos, redistributed the spoils and loaded up the city with unaffordable levels of debt. The gambling mecca is a five-star example of failed liberal policies.",2016-10-05
Clinton Expands Her College Plan,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802058230?accountid=12768,"In a bid to win over rival Bernie Sanders and his supporters, Democrat Hillary Clinton is expanding her plan to offer free college tuition to millions of families, a modified version of what Mr. Sanders pushed in his presidential campaign.
The new Clinton proposal would offer free tuition at public schools to students in families earning $85,000 a year or less, at first, with that threshold increasing to $125,000 by 2021.
Mr. Sanders welcomed the plan as ""a revolutionary step forward."" Speaking to reporters, he applauded her move as ""very, very significant"" and said the new plan combines the best of both candidates' ideas. But he continued to hold off an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, who has the Democratic nomination in hand. ""This is one issue--there are other issues,"" he said.
Mr. Sanders's plan would eliminate tuition at public colleges altogether. Young voters overwhelmingly backed Mr. Sanders over Mrs. Clinton, and many cited his proposal.
Throughout their primary campaign, Mrs. Clinton argued that her college affordability plan was superior. Her earlier proposal guaranteed that families wouldn't have to borrow money to attend college, but insisted that students and their parents contribute what they could afford. She described this as a way to make sure everybody had ""skin in the game.""
In a statement, Mrs. Clinton continued to talk about her policy in terms of ""debt-free"" college, as opposed to Mr. Sanders's more sweeping vision of ""tuition-free"" school.
""American families are drowning in debt caused by ever-rising college costs and it is imperative that the next president put forward a bold plan to make debt-free college available to all,"" she said.
It isn't clear how many additional families would get free tuition under the modified version compared with the original Clinton plan. The campaign also didn't say how much the new version would cost or how she would pay for it.
Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said the Vermont senator is particularly interested in Mrs. Clinton moving toward him on health care. ""He's pretty clearly said in interviews that he is interested in seeing some progress on this topic [college costs] and on health care,"" Mr. Briggs said.
On health care, Mrs. Clinton has said that she supports allowing people who are nearing retirement to buy into Medicare. She has also said she backs a public option to compete with private insurers on the new health-care exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. But Mrs. Clinton hasn't promoted either idea or given any details.
Mr. Sanders is coming under increasing pressure to endorse Mrs. Clinton from congressional Democrats, who are growing frustrated and feel that he is dragging the process out.
At a closed-door meeting with House Democrats Tuesday morning, Democratic lawmakers shouted ""timeline, timeline"" and said ""answer the question,"" when Mr. Sanders was asked when he would endorse Mrs. Clinton, according to a Democratic aide.
""He took a little bit of heat, and did it with grace,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D., Va.) ""He was certainly pressed--'When are you going to endorse? What is the timeline?' ""
A Clinton aide said that she made the decision to modify her college plan after a meeting last month with Mr. Sanders, where the pair discussed their respective plans and ""strategized"" about the best way to promote the issue in the party's platform and fall campaign.
The Democratic platform committee is meeting this weekend to consider recommendations from a drafting committee.
The campaign said her new proposal would eliminate tuition for more than 80% of families, who would owe no tuition for students at in-state public colleges and universities.
She is also promising ""immediate"" executive action to offer all students with college debt a three-month moratorium on repaying loans. That would give them time to consolidate loans, sign up for income-based repayment plans and take advantage of ways to reduce interest payments and fees, the campaign said.
Borrowers who are delinquent or in default would have additional options. Mrs. Clinton's revised plan would also restore Pell Grant funding for summer school.
Last August, Mrs. Clinton at $350 billion over 10 years. Mr. Sanders said his plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years, with tens of billions more required from the states.

Ironically, Ms. Rabinowitz's characterization of Mr. Trump and the ""NeverHillary"" crowd is virtually the same argument I heard from radical left-wing zealots about Ronald Reagan and his supporters when I was in college in 1980. She turns a blind eye to the fact that Hillary Clinton is the pure embodiment and one of the main architects of progressive policies that have drained vigor from America's economy, diminished America's stature in the world, emboldened despotic regimes and terrorists the world over, left millions of Syrians to the genocidal whims of the Assad-Russia-Iran axis and made America and our allies less safe by being an enabler of what assuredly will be a nuclear-armed Iran in the not-too-distant future. To say nothing of her pathological lying and chronic tendency toward abuse of power and self-dealing as the ultimate political insider.
It is entrenched politicians like Mrs. Clinton who think they know better than we do about Americans' well-being that gave rise to Mr. Trump in the first place.

In your hearts you know that Donald Trump is unfit to be president. You never dreamed he'd make it this far. Ms. Rabinowitz is right.

Dorothy Rabinowitz does a great service by focusing her analytical powers and elegant prose on the differences between the two presidential candidates. Mrs. Clinton's qualifications to be president, her experience in national security and international matters and her vision manifested by a multidecade fight for feminism, education and health care are well-known and correctly noted without neglecting her unfortunate conflation of racism with law and order. In contrast, there is Mr. Trump's blatant racism, misogyny, narcissism, isolationism and instability.

I agree with everything Ms. Rabinowitz writes about why she won't vote for Donald Trump, but the damage he might do to our country in four or even eight years doesn't compare with the cultural and legal changes lasting for generations that Mrs. Clinton can do with her choices of Supreme Court justices.

I have no hatred for nor a derangement syndrome concerning Hillary Clinton, but I have an understanding of her deep character flaws and inability to tell the truth about almost anything. I have seen her use her position as secretary of state to feather her and her husband's nest and to ensure that their slush fund, aka the Clinton Foundation, is well supplied with cash donations from countries and individuals who had issues or did business with the U.S. government. Her friends and her brother profited by the rebuilding of Haiti, and she supported the use of taxpayer dollars to Laureate International University, which promptly hired Bill Clinton as ""honorary chancellor"" for $17.5 million. She signed off on the sale of 20% of U.S. uranium stocks to Russia, and the Clinton Foundation received a $240 million donation from the Canadian mining conglomerate that put the deal together. She made $200,000 or more for each of the 92 20-minute speeches she gave to Wall Street bankers, traders and hedge-fund managers, and no one knows what she promised them, as no speech transcripts have ever surfaced. She lied about Benghazi, her email server, her exposure of classified information and then undertook a vast coverup to destroy evidence and hinder justice. If we had an honest Justice Department and FBI, she would be the subject of a grand-jury probe and likely be put on trial.

"The Republican Convention: Clinton Attacked, Foes Silenced --- Trump critics denied a roll call on their move to let delegates back other candidates",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805203722?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- On the first night of Donald Trump's convention, Republicans assailed Hillary Clinton for the 2012 attack on Benghazi, illegal immigration and recent killings of police officers they said were the result of societal breakdowns caused by feckless leadership in Washington.
At the same time, Mr. Trump's campaign and its Republican National Committee allies presided over the most chaotic scene at a national party convention in generations, with hundreds of delegates shouting for a roll-call vote to disrupt his forthcoming nomination and one state delegation walking off the floor.
Mr. Trump's campaign dismissed the midafternoon disruption as the last gasp of a shrinking number of intraparty opponents. But Kendal Unruh, a leading anti-Trump delegate, said the schisms are now worse. ""They chose to divide and try to conquer. He didn't unify the party,"" Mrs. Unruh said.
Near the close of the evening, Mr. Trump emerged from a darkened stage to introduce his wife, Melania, as the Queen anthem ""We are the Champions"" pumped through the arena's speakers.
Upon taking the stage, Mrs. Trump said her husband was honored to be the GOP's choice for president and testified to his patriotic commitment.
""I can tell you with certainty that my husband has been concerned about our country for as long as I have known him,"" Mrs. Trump said. ""He will never, ever let you down.""
Earlier in the evening session, delegates heard from mothers of U.S. officials killed in Benghazi and a father whose son was murdered by an undocumented immigrant. David Clarke, the African-American sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis., opened his remarks with a retort that ""blue lives matter,"" a reference to recent shootings of police officers.
The themes were aimed at undermining Mrs. Clinton's foreign policy experience and service as secretary of state. They also played to a Trump strength, as a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed voters think he would be tougher on the issue of terrorism by a slight margin.
Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in the attack at the embassy compound in Libya, accused Mrs. Clinton of being emotionally callous. ""I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son, personally,"" she said. ""I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead.""
Her address left some delegates in tears. Yet, in another sign of the undisciplined nature of Mr. Trump's candidacy, he called in to the Fox News Channel at the same moment to criticize Ohio Gov. John Kasich, his former GOP primary rival, for skipping the convention.
The lack of unity for Mr. Trump's nomination was on full display when the delegates convened to vote on the reports of the rules and platform committees. Delegates who have sought for months to deny him the nomination found themselves silenced on key procedural votes.
The final blow to the stop-Trump movement came when Republican National Committee staffers, allied with Trump campaign whips, beat back an effort to conduct a roll-call vote on the party's rules.
Delegates seeking to unseat Mr. Trump had hoped the convention would reject the rules adopted last week and allow delegates to vote their conscience.
Hundreds of delegates, including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, shouted their disapproval, chanting ""roll call vote."" Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, who was presiding over the convention, instead announced based on a voice vote that the ""ayes"" had it and the party's rules were approved.
Mr. Womack left the stage, announcing that the rules had been adopted. The Colorado delegation, which included many of the leaders of the anti-Trump rebellion, walked out of the arena as Mr. Trump's backers shouted ""U-S-A"" and support for Mr. Trump.

Clinton to Madison: Get Me Rewrite,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805441845?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton wants to win over Bernie Sanders voters, and on Saturday she bid for them by reinforcing her promise to rewrite the First Amendment to limit political speech that she and they don't like.
""Today, I'm announcing that in my first 30 days as President, I will propose a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and give the American people -- all of us -- the chance to reclaim our democracy,"" Mrs. Clinton said in a taped speech to the Netroots Nation conference of progressives. First 30 days? Who knew the 225-year-old First Amendment was in need of such urgent revision?
Citizens United is the 2010 Supreme Court decision that restored the free-speech and association rights of corporations and unions. That decision was rooted, if we can use that word in polite netroots company, in the language of the First Amendment. The constitutional amendment Mrs. Clinton has in mind would have to rewrite James Madison. Dead white males may be out of progressive favor, but we suspect most Americans still trust Madison more than they do the boys at the Daily Kos.
Mrs. Clinton knows that such an amendment won't pass, so she also took up the spirit of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent comments that she expects a new liberal majority on the Court to rewrite the First Amendment the easier way. ""I'll also appoint Supreme Court justices who understand that this decision was a disaster for our democracy,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""And I hope some of the brilliant minds in this room will seek out cases to challenge Citizens United in the courts."" So add one more litmus test for Mrs. Clinton's Supreme Court nominees.
The presumptive Democratic nominee also said she'll press the Securities and Exchange Commission to require publicly traded companies to disclose all political spending. The point here is to expose companies and CEOs to public vilification and boycotts if they donate to the wrong causes or candidates. Instead of moving to the center, Mrs. Clinton keeps raising the stakes of this election by moving left.

As for Mr. Trump's crude discussion with a TV personality, Heather Mac Donald writes, ""The sudden onset of Victorian vapors among the liberal intelligentsia and political class at the revelation of Trump's locker-room talk is part and parcel of the Left's hypocrisy when it comes to feminism and sexual liberation .""
A Journal editorial notes that Republican congressional leaders have an obligation to try to prevent Hillary Clinton ""from returning to Washington with a Democratic Senate and perhaps even House."" The editorial adds that a ""new burst of liberal legislation could include a 'public option' for ObamaCare that would be one more giant leap toward government-run health care . Energy from fossil fuels would become stranded assets. Government by and for the regulatory state would accelerate, and the Supreme Court would be lost to judicial conservatives for a generation .""
The editorial board is puzzled by ""NeverTrumpians who appear willing to have Republicans lose the House and Senate as punishment for even associating with Mr. Trump. In that they are allied with the Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren Democrats, albeit themselves safely insulated from the political consequences .""
A separate editorial notes that Mr. Trump's bad idea to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton may have been inspired by the Obama Justice Department's 2009 hiring of a special prosecutor to investigate the conduct of Americans engaged in the war on terror. And don't forget the FBI absolution of Mrs. Clinton , which has ""undermined public confidence in a single standard of justice.""
""The U.S. had six Nobel prize winners this year, and all six are immigrants,"" observes the editorial board . The U.S. is ""fortunate to have a great network of research universities to attract and keep talent from around the world .""
David Henderson writes that to understand the work of this year's winners in economics, Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom, one must start with a basic idea: ""Incentives matter . Mr. Hart and Mr. Holmstrom take that principle and run with it, seeking to understand incentives within both individual companies and the larger market structure. Implicit in all of their work is the idea that if it's difficult to design optimal incentives within a single firm, it's well-nigh impossible for central planners to do it for the entire economy .""
""There are maybe two dozen highly competitive House races this fall, but few are as consequential as the cage match in New York's 19th Congressional District,"" writes the Journal's Allysia Finley . That's where John Faso, a Paul Ryan conservative, is battling Elizabeth Warren protg Zephyr Teachout .

"Election 2016: Polls: Clinton, Trump Close in Key States --- Democrat leads by 9 points in Pennsylvania; presidential race much closer in Ohio, Iowa",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803693848?accountid=12768,"Presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are running close in Ohio and Iowa, while the presumptive Democratic nominee is well ahead in Pennsylvania, new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist polls find.
The polls, coming just before Republicans gather in Cleveland for their national convention, offer mixed signs for Mr. Trump's prospects for charting a path to the White House through the industrial Midwest. The region is home to many of the working-class, white voters drawn to his campaign, but it has sided with Democrats in recent presidential elections.
Mrs. Clinton holds a 9-point lead, 45% to 36% in Pennsylvania. In Ohio, a perennial and vote-rich battleground state, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are tied among registered voters, with 39% support each. In Iowa, Mrs. Clinton holds a 3-point lead, 42% to his 39%.
The polls showed that Mr. Trump faces significant deficits with African-American voters and other nonwhite voters. In Pennsylvania, for example, Mrs. Clinton is winning 91% of African-Americans. Mr. Trump registered zero support in both Ohio and Pennsylvania. But his backers argue that he can make up the difference with a strong performance among white voters.
National polls draw great attention in the presidential race, but the contest will be decided by the electoral-college vote results in each state. Ohio and Iowa are closely watched, as are states such as Florida and Nevada, because their support has swung between the two parties in recent decades.
Overall, the surveys show a remarkably unsettled race between two widely disliked contenders. In each state, around 20% of voters said they were either undecided or volunteered that they would support neither Mr. Trump nor Mrs. Clinton.
Far more voters in the three states said they had an unfavorable impression of both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton than a favorable one. In Iowa and Ohio, she was nearly as disliked as he is.
""There's still a lot to be done in both camps to move their campaigns forward,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ""It puts a premium on the conventions and the ability to present their candidates and give them a second chance to make a first impression.""
The polls were conducted from July 5-10, in the immediate aftermath of a critical report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Mrs. Clinton's decision to use a private email server for her official business as secretary of state. Mr. Miringoff said the news is likely to have pushed down support for her in these surveys. ""I think this was not her best time by any means of the campaign,"" he said.
The margin of error was plus or minus 3.4 percentage points in each of the three states.
The surveys suggest third-party candidates could have an unpredictable impact on the race. When given the additional options of backing Libertarian and Green Party candidates, Mrs. Clinton opened a 3-point lead in Ohio, 38% to 35%, the survey in that state found. But in Iowa, her narrow lead over Mr. Trump diminished into a tie, at 37% support each.
In Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton's 9-point lead remained substantially intact when participants were given the third-party options.
In 2012, President Barack Obama won all three of these states in his re-election contest against Republican Mitt Romney. No Republican presidential candidate has carried Pennsylvania since 1988, though some have made a run at it.
The new Journal/NBC News/Marist polls offer mixed signals about whether Mr. Trump can overcome his deficit among minority voters.
In all three states, Mrs. Clinton tops Mr. Trump among white voters with a four-year college degree, the surveys found. Mr. Trump wins white voters without a degree, though not always by the margins he is likely to need.
Mr. Trump led Mrs. Clinton among white voters without a degree by 19 points in Ohio and by 10 points in Pennsylvania, which helps explain why the race is much closer in Ohio. In 2012, Mr. Romney, the Republican nominee, won among white voters without a college degree by 14 points in both Ohio and Pennsylvania, exit polls showed, and lost both states.
In Iowa, Mr. Trump led by 6 percentage points among white voters without a college degree. That is an improvement on the GOP performance in 2012, when exit polls showed Mr. Obama won among those voters by 2 percentage points in 2012.
The surveys also tested voter preferences in some of the year's most-watched Senate races and found mixed results for the parties' chances. In Pennsylvania, Republican incumbent Pat Toomey trails his Democratic rival, Katie McGinty, 44% to 47%.
Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio is tied with his challenger, Democrat Ted Strickland. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a Republican, leads Democratic opponent Patty Judge by 10 points, 52% to 42%.
The poll surveyed 829 registered voters in Pennsylvania, 848 in Ohio and 822 in Iowa.

'Spy' Magazine Returns in Digital Form --- Raucous humor magazine will turn lens on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1827819097?accountid=12768,"It was probably inevitable. With Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump battling for the presidency, Spy magazine is returning to chronicle every daily twist and turn of the campaign's final stretch.
In its new iteration, Spy is resurfacing as a short-lived digital pop-up that will be available on Esquire magazine's website, Esquire.com. The new edition launched Tuesday and will last appear on Election Day. Esquire is owned by closely held Hearst Corp.
""We're pleased to do a quick sprint,"" said David Carey, president of Hearst Magazines. ""You never know where something like this may lead.""
Spy, a raucous humor magazine, was co-founded in 1986 by Graydon Carter, now editor of Vanity Fair; author Kurt Andersen, and Tom Phillips. In its day Spy lampooned many of the rich and famous, describing Mr. Trump as a ""short-fingered vulgarian"" and portraying Mrs. Clinton on the February 1993 cover as clad in a leather dominatrix outfit.
The publication was sold in 1994 to investor Jo Colman, chief executive and owner of Psychology Today. Mr. Colman closed Spy in 1998 but retained ownership. Mr. Colman said that he has licensed Spy to Hearst Corp. for the length of the digital edition.
The new Spy has a staff of four led by special projects editor Josh Wolk. It is launching with six to eight stories. Spy hopes to publish as many as five original pieces daily. Wieden & Kennedy is overseeing advertising.
""It's a fearless project, and we're happy to be involved,"" said Colleen DeCourcy, global executive creative director, via an email.
Mr. Andersen said in an interview that he is among those contributing to the first day's edition.
""I wish it well,"" he said. ""It's amazing that it's back in the picture."" Mr. Andersen's piece is in the form of an introductory letter to readers.
Fans can expect to find new versions of such classic Spy features as ""Separated at Birth"" and ""Logrolling in Our Time."" Some original Spy stories may also be republished.
""There may be a lot of humor surrounding this election, but there's ample room for Spy's special appreciation of the absurd,"" said Jay Fielden, who became Esquire's editor in chief last April after having served as editor of sister magazine Town & Country. ""Spy's past dovetails with the rise of the two people running for president. It will be a fact-based journalistic satire digitally reimagined.""
Mr. Fielden, who remains editorial director of Town & Country, added that Nov. 8 will be the edition's last day ""unless there are any hanging chads.""

Mr. Trump, defiant and enraged in speeches on Thursday, flatly denied charges he had made inappropriate advances on the women over the past three decades
""What they say is false and slanderous in virtually every respect,"" he said at a rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Thursday, the day after the New York Times and other news outlets published accounts of women who said he had fondled or kissed them against their will.
As early as Friday, Mr. Trump is planning to claim that Mr. Slim, as a shareholder of New York Times Co. and donor to the Clinton Foundation, has an interest in helping Hillary Clinton's campaign, according to a Trump adviser.
Attacking the Mexican billionaire would allow Mr. Trump to hit several targets. He could slam the ""failing"" New York Times, which he says had to be ""rescued"" by a ""foreigner"" -- Mr. Slim, the adviser said.
""This is totally false,"" said Arturo Elias, Mr. Slim's spokesman. ""Of course we aren't interfering in the U.S. election. We aren't even active in Mexican politics."" He said the contributions by Mr. Slim to the Clinton Foundation were a matter of public record.
The Slim family held about 17% of the New York Times Class A shares as of March, making them the largest individual shareholder. The Sulzberger family still controls the company, with more than 90% of the Class B shares. Mr. Slim and his foundation have given between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation since its founding.
""Carlos Slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism,"" said publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. ""He has never sought to influence what we report.""
The Times said it stood by its reporting and declined a demand from a lawyer representing Mr. Trump to remove the story.
The attack on Mr. Slim ""is just another deranged right-wing conspiracy theory from Donald Trump's increasingly desperate campaign,"" said Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary.
Mr. Trump said in his Florida speech he would produce emails and other evidence to counter the sexual-misconduct claims but didn't give specifics. Instead, he framed the episode in blunt populist terms, of how the political and media establishments are pitted against him and his supporters. ""I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you,"" he said. ""I take them for our movement so that we can have our country back.""
Mr. Trump's speech was an extended response to the spate of reports that surfaced Wednesday just as Trump allies had been hoping he had stabilized his standing in the race following last week's release of a 2005 video in which he bragged about being able to exploit women sexually.

October Is for Halloween--Not Voting; Wait for Election Day. Clinton or Trump may change your mind.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1829397844?accountid=12768,"The election is still three weeks away, and hundreds of thousands of Americans have already voted. Yet in politics a lot can happen in only a few days: Donald Trump has recently been accused of groping women, and leaked emails show Hillary Clinton's staff mocking Catholics. How many Americans who voted before those revelations wish they could get their ballots back?
California launched the early-voting mania in 1978, when it first allowed no-excuse absentee ballots. Today 37 states and the District of Columbia allow residents to vote early, with no need to state why they can't show up on Election Day. In Minnesota early voting began on Sept. 23, a full month and a half before the election. President Obama voted on Oct. 7 and encouraged others to follow his lead.
All this has dramatically changed the character of American elections. In 1992 only 7% of presidential ballots were cast early. The figure rose to 31.6% by 2012. For nearly a third of the electorate, the last month--or more--of campaigning is irrelevant. Two of the three presidential debates were effectively written off. Candidates could be exposed for past indiscretions. They could withdraw or even die.
Imagine a town meeting convened to decide an important matter. For convenience, ballots are distributed when residents arrive. Yet numerous people return their ballots and leave before the time designated for public comments. At best it will be clear that those who left are not interested in anyone else's opinions. At worst it makes a mockery of the democratic process that citizens thought they were engaged in.
The usual arguments in favor of early voting are that it makes casting a ballot more convenient and improves turnout. Is this true? In the 1992 presidential election, 55.2% of the voting-age population cast ballots . In 2012 it was a bit lower, 54.9%. Why would that be? A study from 2013 by four professors at the University of Wisconsin posits that early voting reduces ""the civic significance of elections.""
But even if early voting did increase turnout, it isn't clear why turnout is a valuable goal in itself. If some people are uninterested--and possibly uniformed--why would anyone want to urge them toward the polls?
Proponents of early voting also claim that the inconvenience of showing up at a specified location on Election Day disproportionately affects racial minorities, the poor and workers without flexible schedules. But to the extent that this is true, other accommodations--adding more polling places in better locations, extending polling hours, making Election Day a state or national holiday--would better fix the problem.
Traditional absentee voting--commonly allowed for sickness, physical disability, religious observance or prolonged absence overseas--imposes minimal burdens while not undercutting the civic benefits of a single election day. But no-excuse early voting presumes that Americans have fixed views and that the candidates cannot say or do anything to influence them in the final weeks of the campaign. In that sense it is a corruption of the democratic process--one that accepts and encourages the partisan divisions that plague modern American politics and poison the civic spirit.

Investors May Be Misjudging U.S. Election Volatility; VIX could spring back should polls tighten between Clinton and Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828833793?accountid=12768,"Stock investors jolted by the volatility spike after the British referendum are overlooking the potential for another shock from the U.S. election, Wall Street analysts say.
""Brexit was a big wake-up call. Investors knew that the likelihood of the Leave camp succeeding was greater than zero but they still underestimated the odds and few people hedged ahead of the vote,"" said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research. With the U.S. presidential election, ""there's a little too much complacency. As we approach election, volatility will probably creep up.""
The options market is indicating a 1.6% swing by the S&P 500 index in the week after the Nov. 8 voting day, based on contracts expiring before and after that day, according to BNP Paribas SA.
The implied move seems humble versus the outsize jump in stock market turbulence after the unexpected outcome of the U.K. vote, said Anand Omprakash, the New York-based director of equity & derivative strategy at BNP.
The S&P 500 tumbled 5% in two days after the June vote by Britons to leave the European Union and dropped 2.5% on Sept. 9 as hawkish-sounding Federal Reserve officials compounded worries that central banks wouldn't be as accommodative.
The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, has averaged 14.5 since Sept. 9. While that is higher than the multiyear lows reached in the summer, the average is still significantly below the measure's five-year average and could spring back should polls tighten between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate who represents the status quo, and Donald Trump, a Washington outsider.
""Volatility is reasonably priced in light of what happened after the British referendum in June and extremely inexpensive given the political climate,"" Mr. Omprakash said. ""Past elections haven't been as consequential as this one with the potential for uncertainty. Investors know what they're getting with Hillary Clinton but there's concern that she won't win.""
Mr. Trump trailed Mrs. Clinton by 4 percentage points in North Carolina, and was ahead by 1 point in Ohio, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday.
The S&P 500's lackluster advance this year is further deterring investors from loading up on pricey hedges as they look to lock in returns for 2016. ""They don't want to spend for premium positioning if they're already in a good spot,"" Mr. Omprakash said.
BNP recommends a trade that allows investors to be long December volatility. Investors should buy puts and calls on the S&P 500 expiring mid-December at strike prices closest to where the gauge is trading--a trade known as a straddle--while also selling contracts that expire on Nov. 11.
Research firm Cornerstone Macro said in a note last month that investors can gain cheap exposure to the election by selling Nov. 4 calls on exchange-traded funds that track the small-cap Russell 2000 index and S&P 500 Technology stocks, while simultaneously buying calls that expire one week later-- a strategy that wagers on an increase in volatility while offsetting the cost of the trade.
Investors can also bet on upcoming central bank meetings by putting on the inverse version of the trade with ETFs tracking utility, energy and consumer-staple companies, Cornerstone said.
In the last six elections, the VIX has always climbed higher in the month leading up to a U.S. election, by an average of 3.5 points, according to Credit Suisse Group AG's Mandy Xu.
Adding to risks this year are lofty valuations for U.S. equities and polls showing a potential switch up in the U.S. Senate in a month that has seen wilder price swings in the past, said Chris Rogers of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. The S&P 500 is trading at 16.6 times reported profits in the next year, FactSet data show.
""Historically, October has been a month that's seen more market gyrations,"" said Mr. Rogers, the New York-based director of capital markets advisory services at BNY. ""There is a perception of calm out there. That the market move may not be extraordinary but will be a slow melt up.""
But spikes in volatility have been more dramatic when they occur with central banks artificially suppressing price swings, said BNP's Mr. Omprakash. That has boosted the popularity of carry trades in which investors sell VIX futures or short a volatility ETP to profit from the difference in prices between closer-dated contracts and longer-dated ones.
""A lot of these trades have been done on the back of confidence that central banks will step in when necessary,"" he said. ""Should central banks surprise negatively, markets could erupt violently"" as short bets are unwound at the same time as risk-on long positions.
Investors who see Mr. Trump winning can buy options on stocks that should outperform if he wins, such as student lenders, for-profit colleges, auto-part retailers and energy companies such as refiners and master-limited partnerships, Ms. Xu, Credit Suisse's equity derivatives strategist, wrote in a note this month. Alternatively, those who predict a victory by Mrs. Clinton should buy calls on hospital, Medicaid-care, regional-bank and higher-education companies.

Judge Temporarily Blocks Marine's Discharge Involving Classified Information; Maj. Jason Brezler's lawyer called the mishandling of classified material minor in comparison to Hillary Clinton's email lapses,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828618649?accountid=12768,"A Marine Corps reserve officer won a temporary victory in federal court Friday, effectively blocking a discharge order handed down after he was found to have improperly handled classified information, something his lawyer called a minor transgression compared with Hillary Clinton's security lapses .
The court appearance was the culmination of Maj. Jason Brezler's long-running effort to reverse a Marine decision to discharge him and to prove that top generals, including the commandant of the Marine Corps, punished him because he brought attention to alleged mistakes that led to the deaths of three troops in Afghanistan.
U.S. District Judge Joseph Bianco told the Marine Corps to temporarily hold its decision to discharge Maj. Brezler. He also gave lawyers for the Marines just over a week to provide more information about the details of the case.
""They have 10 days to show proof they didn't retaliate against him,"" said Michael Bowe, Maj. Brezler's lawyer.
The Marine Corps didn't respond immediately to a request for comment.
Maj. Brezler, of Brooklyn, has argued his infraction occurred during an emergency effort to warn fellow Marines of an imminent threat in Afghanistan. Mr. Bowe said he had planned to make Mrs. Clinton's email transgressions part of his argument at the hearing but didn't have time to do so because it proceeded quickly.
Mrs. Clinton made use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state from 2009-2013. Federal Bureau of Investigation officials found in July that she and colleagues were ""extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" but FBI Director James Comey recommended against prosecution .
The Marine Corps case stretches back more than half a decade, beginning when Maj. Brezler, an officer in the Marine Corps reserve, was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 and identified an Afghan police officer whom he deemed a threat to U.S. forces. U.S. officials found the policeman to be corrupt and that he trafficked in young boys as part of a sex-slave practice known as bacha bazi in Afghanistan. Maj. Brezler worked to expel the Afghan officer from his post.
Two years later, according to court documents, in 2012, Maj. Brezler discovered the Afghan officer again had taken up an official post with the Afghan police and had resumed working with U.S. forces. Saying he wanted to immediately warn fellow Marines, Maj. Brezler sent a classified document over civilian email.
Despite the email, U.S. officials didn't remove the Afghan officer from his position and two weeks later, in August 2012, one of the Afghan's subordinates grabbed a rifle and shot dead three Marine advisers working with him.
Afterward, Rep. Peter King (R., N.Y.), who knew of Maj. Brezler's actions, sought information from the Marine Corps. About the same time, the Marine Corps Times published an article about the deaths, raising the public profile on the incident and drawing heightened attention from top Marines, including then-Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Jim Amos, according to emails obtained in the case by Maj. Brezler's law team.
Gen. Amos, now retired, couldn't be reached for comment.
Maj. Brezler's superiors recommended he be sent to a board of inquiry, a hearing that can recommend separation from the Corps, and gave him a negative performance evaluation, considered a career-ending action. Maj. Brezler maintains the move represented retaliation for the publicity. The Marines declined to comment on specifics of the case.
""Due to ongoing litigation, it would be inappropriate for the Marine Corps to comment upon this matter,"" said a statement before Friday's hearing. ""However, the Marine Corps maintains confidence in the legal and administrative processes that have occurred to date regarding Maj. Jason Brezler.""
At the board of inquiry, investigators presented evidence that Maj. Brezler had classified documents on his personal computer, a violation of policy, and that he further mishandled the documents by emailing one of them on a civilian account.
Maj. Brezler's lawyers say the documents were held over on his computer because the Marines didn't provide him a computer when he was deployed and he neglected to delete them upon returning home. And the email, although technically a violation, was an attempt to save lives.
""Maj. Brezler, instead of being given a medal, is being removed from the military,"" said Mr. King, whose district included the residence of one of the Marines killed in the August 2012 shooting. ""His mistake was he wanted to save lives.""
Maj. Brezler's defense is multipronged, arguing that at each step of the administrative process, senior Marines broke from official protocol. His lawyer also claimed Maj. Brezler's mishandling of classified information, though improper, wasn't uncommon and that merely having classified information on a computer is no reason for such extreme measures, citing the lack of punishment for Mrs. Clinton as precedent.
Retired Lt. Col. James Weirick, who was a lawyer in the Marines and who has publicly challenged Marine leadership on whistleblowing issues, said it isn't uncommon for people to return from combat zones with low-level classified information on computers they used in country and that it is extraordinarily rare for them to be punished for it.

Election 2016: Polls Find Clinton Leading in 4 Swing States,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803992024?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump in four of the nation's most racially diverse battleground states, new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist polls show.
Mrs. Clinton holds comfortable single-digit leads over her presumptive Republican rival in Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, the polls found.
The results from the polls conducted July 5-11 suggest that Mr. Trump has a fairly steep hill to climb in a quartet of states that often decide presidential races. He trails Mrs. Clinton by 6 percentage points among registered voters in North Carolina, 7 in Florida, 8 in Colorado and 9 in Virginia, the surveys found.
In all four states, more than one voter in 10 didn't pick either candidate, saying they would back neither one, another candidate or were undecided.
Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Trump 44% to 37% among registered voters in Florida, the nation's largest swing state. She had 44% to Mr. Trump's 35% in Virginia, and was ahead 43% to 35% in Colorado.
President Barack Obama won all three states in his two White House campaigns. In North Carolina, which Mr. Obama narrowly lost in 2012, Mrs. Clinton had 44% to 38% for Mr. Trump.
These states are among the most racially diverse presidential battlegrounds, with large shares of Hispanic or African-American voters. The race looks much tighter in less-diverse Iowa and Ohio, according to Journal/NBC News/Marist surveys released Wednesday.
In Florida, Virginia and Colorado, Mrs. Clinton's lead narrows slightly when Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are added to the survey.
Mr. Johnson, the former New Mexico governor, garners 13% of the vote in neighboring Colorado and 10% in Virginia, a state where past polling has overestimated support for Libertarian candidates.
These surveys show a trend familiar from earlier national and state-level polls: Mrs. Clinton dominates among African-American and Hispanic voters, while Mr. Trump posts big leads among white voters who don't have a four-year college degree.
Support for Mr. Trump among African-Americans is 5% in Florida, 4% in North Carolina and 3% in Virginia, all below the 7% support that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney garnered nationally.
Even among Mr. Trump's core constituency -- whites who lack four-year college degrees -- he trails the levels of support that Mr. Romney registered in 2012 in Florida and Virginia, as calculated by exit polls that year.
Mr. Trump also fails to register more than 79% support among Republican voters in all four states, a sign of his continued struggles to unify his party. Democratic support for Mrs. Clinton is higher.
If Mrs. Clinton's lead holds going into the fall, the race could shift to a handful of Midwestern states where Republicans have struggled since the 1980s, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That dynamic helps explain why Mr. Trump is expected to pick a political leader from the region, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, as his running mate.
Educational attainment continues to be one of the biggest dividing lines in the race. While Mr. Trump leads among white voters without a four-year college degree, Mrs. Clinton leads among white college graduates in Colorado and Virginia. The two are nearly deadlocked among these voters in North Carolina, and Mr. Trump has a 5 percentage-point lead in Florida.
The race in these four states could come down to which candidates are disliked the least, as voters in each hold unusually dim views of both major party nominees.
At least 58% of voters in all four states view Mrs. Clinton unfavorably, and at least 61% view Mr. Trump unfavorably. In Colorado, 68% have a negative opinion of him. In some states, the numbers are even worse among independent voters.

A Trump Economy Beats Clinton's,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803991953?accountid=12768,"Certain business leaders and prominent conservatives have denounced Donald Trump's economic policies and even argued that Hillary Clinton would be a better choice in November. This is hard to fathom. Although we disagree with him on some issues, we have both signed on as economic advisers to Mr. Trump because we are confident in the direction he would take the country.
What could possibly be the economic case for Mrs. Clinton? She has vowed to defend President Obama's ""legacy"" and double down on job-killers like ObamaCare. Even Bill Clinton knows that the status quo hasn't worked: In March he told a crowd that it is time to ""put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us.""
Since the end of the recession, economic growth has averaged an anemic 2.1%, producing the weakest ""recovery"" since the Great Depression. That has slowed to 1.4% in the last quarter of 2015 and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2016. The middle class is shrinking, and median household income today, in real terms, is lower than when Mr. Obama took office. By more than two to one, Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
What does Mr. Trump offer as an alternative?
-- The biggest pro-growth tax cut since Ronald Reagan's 1981 reform. Mr. Trump would simplify the tax code and significantly reduce marginal rates, encouraging investment and economic expansion. His proposed corporate tax rate of 15% would make it easier for American firms to repatriate earnings, bringing capital home and making the U.S. a more hospitable place to invest. Mr. Trump's tax plan would do more for working-class and middle-class families than any scheme to redistribute income.
Don't believe the phony claim that it will cost $10 trillion over a decade. As Americans will see when he reveals the entire plan in the next few weeks, any revenue loss would be a fraction of that amount.
-- The repeal of ObamaCare, the fastest-growing entitlement program of all. Mr. Trump promises to replace the law with a consumer-choice health plan. He also wants to immediately repeal dozens of President Obama's antibusiness executive orders.
-- A pro-growth energy policy. Mr. Trump wants to employ all of America's abundant resources -- oil, natural gas and coal. His plan could make America the world's No. 1 energy producer within five years, producing millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of extra output -- along with new royalty payments to the government. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, brags that she would put ""a lot of coal miners"" out of work.
We don't see eye to eye with Mr. Trump on everything. In our opinion, legal immigrants are an asset to the country. We believe that deporting 11 million people is unworkable, and we hope in the end Mr. Trump comes to this same conclusion. Deportation should be pursued only when an illegal immigrant has committed a felony or become a ""public charge.""
But the difference here is smaller than often portrayed. Although Mr. Trump is depicted as a close-the-doors nativist, he has said that he favors legal immigration, and he has hired thousands of legal immigrants. His proposals on illegal immigration -- to build a wall, increase enforcement of the law, deport criminal aliens, defund sanctuary cities, and reduce visa overstays -- are reasonable and sensible given that voters demand action.
We are also free traders and oppose punitive tariffs. The U.S. needs trade. Yet it also must have a president willing to negotiate from a position of strength with countries that manipulate their currencies, steal Americans' intellectual property, or compel companies to disclose trade secrets as a condition of entering their markets. Negotiating better trade deals and enforcing the current ones would help the U.S. economy.
Ideological purists miss a practical point. Right or wrong, working-class Americans believe that they disproportionately bear the burdens of free-trade deals. Taking a tougher stance might be necessary to restore dwindling support for open markets.
Concern that Mr. Trump is a showman, temperamentally unsuited for the Oval Office, is misplaced. Running a successful business enterprise as CEO is an excellent qualification for the presidency. Mr. Trump has had prolonged success. He didn't fake that. We find it refreshing and uplifting that middle-class and working-class voters don't envy Mr. Trump or view him as an evil rich guy. Rather, they admire his success and want to emulate it.
Trump's detractors love to point to his businesses that did not succeed. But one of the great things about the U.S. is that people can rise above their failures. Henry Ford and Steve Jobs did, and they changed the world. The skyscrapers that bear his name all over the world are evidence that Mr. Trump has maintained a level of success that few people ever achieve.
Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination decisively against the best field of candidates that any party has put forth in modern times. To win the presidency, he will need to persuade millions of working-class voters that the party of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has abandoned them. In doing so, Mr. Trump will bring Reagan Democrats home to the GOP where they belong. Isn't this what the party has been trying to do for 30 years?

U.S. News: Sen. Kaine Seen as Clinton's VP Pick --- Virginian with Spanish skills and low-key style could aid Democrat in the general election,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806008156?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is on the verge of announcing her vice-presidential pick, with Democrats familiar with her search believing she will settle on a Spanish-speaking ally from a battleground state: Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.
Two other candidates also were considered until the end -- Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, people familiar with the process said. The Clinton campaign declined to comment.
Mrs. Clinton is likely to announce her selection Friday in the form of a text message to supporters. On Saturday, she is set to campaign in Florida, a potential stage for a joint appearance with her newly minted running mate.
Mrs. Clinton and her allies have long said that her top considerations for a vice-presidential pick are a good governing partner and someone who could step into the job of president if needed. Democrats familiar with her thinking say she believes Mr. Kaine passes those tests.
Voters tend to focus on the top of the ticket, but Mr. Kaine could offer a political boostfor the Clinton campaign. Though unflashy by his own admission, his Spanish fluency might be able to cement her lead among Hispanic voters, a key general-election constituency. He is considered a loyal figure who would mesh well with Mrs. Clinton's leadership style.
Geography may be another Kaine selling point.
Former President Bill Clinton believes that if his wife wins Virginia, the Republican ticket has virtually no realistic path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win, a person familiar with his thinking said. In presidential elections dating to 2000, the candidate who won Virginia went on to win the White House.
A look at the electoral map shows that if Mrs. Clinton wins Virginia, Mr. Trump could lose the election even if he captured Florida and Ohio, assuming Mrs. Clinton holds other battleground states won by Barack Obama in his two presidential bids.
Another person close to Mr. Clinton said Mr. Kaine is the former president's top choice.
Mr. Kaine, though, is no hero to the Democratic Party's liberal wing. Last year, he voted to give the president ""fast track"" authority considered necessary to eventually approve a controversial 12-nation Pacific trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Free-trade pacts are anathema to some in the Democratic base. Mr. Kaine has staked out a more moderate position that says such deals can help the economy if negotiated in ways that protect workers' rights.
If elected vice president, Mr. Kaine's replacement in the Senate would be selected by a Democratic governor. That isn't the case with three other people Mrs. Clinton considered: Sens. Booker, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.
Under Virginia law, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally, would name a temporary replacement for Mr. Kaine, while the remainder of his term would be filled througha special election in November 2017.
Labor Secretary Tom Perez also was in the running but fell out of the top tier of contenders, one person familiar with the matter said.
Mrs. Clinton repeated this week that her top criterion for the position is someone who can fill the president's job. ""You know, I am afflicted with the responsibility gene, and I know what it's like being president,"" she said in an interview with Charlie Rose.
Mrs. Clinton gave no hint in the interview of whom she favored, but offered her take on several people being considered. Asked about the perception that Mr. Kaine is ""too boring,"" she said that was a plus: ""I love that about him."" She added that he has never lost an election and was a ""world-class mayor, governor and senator.""
Democratic consultant Steve Elmendorf said Donald Trump's choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as a running mate allowed Mrs. Clinton more flexibility. If Mr. Trump had picked Newt Gingrich, a sharp debater, she might have wanted to ensure her choice was ready to face him.

"Russian Hackers Evolve to Serve the Kremlin; Attacks on Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Committee are part of Vladimir Putin's effort to sow instability, U.S. officials say",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1830267046?accountid=12768,"With the hacking of Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee, U.S. officials say Russia has unleashed a strengthened cyberwarfare weapon to sow uncertainty about the U.S. democratic process.
In doing so, Russia has transformed state-sponsored hackers known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear from internet spies to political tools with the power to target the country's adversaries, according to U.S. officials and cybersecurity experts.
The attacks are the harder side of parallel campaigns in the Kremlin's English-language media, which broadcast negative news about Western institutions and alliances and focus on issues that demonstrate or stoke instability in the West, such as Brexit. Moscow seeks particularly to weaken the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has expanded its defense against Russia.
""The underlying philosophy of a lot of these attacks is about establishing information as a weapon,"" said Alexander Klimburg, a cyber expert at the Hague Center for Strategic Studies. ""Hacking for them is literally about controlling information.""
President Vladimir Putin denies Russian involvement in the hacking, but in a way that telegraphs glee about the potential chaos being sown in the U.S. democratic process.
""Everyone is talking about who did it, but is it so important who did it?"" Mr. Putin said. ""What is important is the content of this information.""
Former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden said the Kremlin doesn't appear to be trying to influence the election's outcome, noting Russian involvement has provided fodder for both Republicans and Democrats. ""They are not trying to pick a winner,"" he said Tuesday at a cybersecurity conference in Washington. Rather, Russia is likely unleashing the emails ""to mess with our heads.""
Pro-Kremlin commentators in Russia have seized on the DNC leaks to cast doubt on the American democratic process and argue that Washington has no right to criticize Moscow. They have said the hacked DNC emails, which showed party officials working to undermine primary runner-up Bernie Sanders, prove Americans are hypocritical when they malign Mr. Putin's authoritarianism.
The White House has threatened a ""proportional response"" against Russia.
Retaliating against murky cyberattackers is uncertain new territory, Western officials said. The group often called Fancy Bear has been active since at least 2007 or 2008, experts say. Multiple security companies have given the group different code names including Pawn Storm, Sofacy, and APT 28, which denotes an ""advanced persistent threat.""
Another group, known as Cozy Bear or APT 29, has taken a lower profile, often targeting higher-profile individuals and uses more sophisticated tools to cover its tracks, cybersecurity experts said. It was active as early as 2008 and 2009, with targets related to Chechnya, a U.S.-based think tank and government institutions in Poland and the Czech Republic, according to security firm F-Secure Corp.
The methods are well known: Hackers trick targets into providing account information or downloading infected files through expertly faked emails and webpages, a tactic known as spear-phishing.
The link to Russia's security apparatus is based in part on technical clues. The two groups' malware is deemed too sophisticated for most criminal gangs. Cyrillic script appears in some of the code Fancy Bear used to hack targets in Ukraine in 2015, according to Romanian security firm Bitdefender. Samples of some Cozy Bear malware showed they were generally compiled during business hours in Moscow.
Yet it is the groups' selection of targets that offers the most compelling evidence of Russian involvement, cybersecurity experts say. Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear have generally focused on NATO and allied governments, officials in Eastern Europe, and Western defense groups, such as Academi LLC, the U.S. security firm previously known as Blackwater. In many cases, the information they siphon off aligns closely with Russian interests.
""This all adds up to a strong indication of Russian sponsorship,"" said Laura Galante, director of global intelligence at U.S.-based security firm FireEye Inc. and a former Russia specialist at the U.S. Department of Defense. ""The Russian government has very publicly stated its desire to have ability in this realm. They want the ability to shape the way people think about events.""
Fancy Bear's early efforts were mostly unremarkable and under-the-radar, typical of state-sponsored actors, said Brian Bartholomew, a researcher at Kaspersky Labs. Targets included Georgia's Ministry of Defense and Eastern European governments and militaries, according to FireEye.
But since around 2014, when Russia's annexation of Crimea set off a confrontation with the West, the group has expanded its activities, often in apparent response to news events. In that shift the groups combine traditional spycraft with the public impact of leaks such as those by WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden, who now lives in Russia.
Fancy Bear was behind the hacking alias CyberBerkut, cybersecurity experts said, in attacks that targeted Ukrainian ministries, its presidential elections and posted hacked documents online. The group has been linked to 2014 hacks of Polish government websites, spear-phishing aimed at U.S. and European militaries, the 2015 hacking of Germany's parliament and other attacks in the West.
More recently, private security companies said that Fancy Bear was behind hacking of the DNC and the leaking of athlete information from the World Anti-Doping Agency in September. The leak following the Rio Olympics sought to show U.S. athletes got unfair prescription-drug exemptions just as some Russian athletes were barred from the Olympics over claims of systemic Russian doping violations.

WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange's Isolation Deepens; Ecuador's move follows recent releases of emails from Democratic Party leaders and aides to Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1829939733?accountid=12768,"Ecuador's decision to pull the plug on Julian Assange's internet connection has highlighted the isolation of WikiLeaks, the organization he founded to expose the inner workings of governments and other powerful institutions.
Some former allies and observers say that after four years confined to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, Mr. Assange is alienating former supporters and undermining WikiLeaks' relevance. They cite a series of leaks that they say supported Russian efforts to disrupt the U.S. election and carelessly promoted Turkish government documents exposing the personal information of thousands of ordinary citizens.
WikiLeaks ""has pioneered open government but has now gone off the rails in a way that damages the global transparency movement,"" said Alex Howard, a senior analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, a group once sympathetic to WikiLeaks that backs open-government efforts in the U.S.
WikiLeaks' relationship with Russia has come under particular scrutiny lately after the release of thousands of documents from the Democratic National Committee and allies of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. On Monday, WikiLeaks released a new batch of emails that it alleged were sent or received from John Podesta, a top campaign adviser for Mrs. Clinton.
U.S. government officials have accused Russia of conducting those intrusions as part of an effort to influence the U.S. election. Computer-security firm Kaspersky Labs ZAO said another set of documents published on WikiLeaks, known as the Saudi Cables, most likely came from the same hackers who breached the DNC.
There is no evidence of collusion between Russia and WikiLeaks, said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. ""However, Assange has made it very clear that he's willing to be a useful idiot for any intelligence service, as long as it furthers his own agenda,"" he said.
The Ecuadorean government, in a statement late Tuesday explaining its decision, said that the country doesn't interfere in external electoral processes and so was temporarily restricting ""access to some of its private communication network"" within the embassy.
WikiLeaks had earlier accused the Ecuadorean government of severing Mr. Assange's internet connection at the behest of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. A State Department spokesman on Tuesday rejected the assertion as false.
Mr. Assange still exerts vast influence on the global debate. Others conducting their own disruptive document leaks follow a game plan Mr. Assange sketched out a decade ago.
""Consider what would happen if one of these [political] parties gave up their mobile phones, fax and email correspondence--let alone the computer systems which manage their subscribers, donors, budgets, polling, call centers and direct mail Campaigns,"" Mr. Assange wrote when founding WikiLeaks in 2006. ""They would immediately fall into an organizational stupor and lose to the other.""
Representatives of WikiLeaks and Mr. Assange didn't respond to multiple requests to comment.
WikiLeaks has long billed itself as a news organization. In its early days, it revealed documents ranging from secret Scientology manuals to the internal emails of climate researchers. But it became best known for information related to U.S. government policy.
The emergence of alternative outlets for publishing such material makes Mr. Assange less central. Others published two of the most important leaks in recent years--the Panama Papers documents taken from the Mossack Fonseca & Co. law firm and Edward Snowden's treasure trove of NSA documents.
WikiLeaks once joined with major news organizations and used volunteers to purge personal information from data it published. But Mr. Assange later came to view former partners, including the New York Times and Britain's Guardian, as enemies after disputes over their handling of WikiLeaks material, former Assange confidant and ghostwriter Andrew O'Hagan wrote in 2014. A Guardian representative said it last collaborated worked with WikiLeaks in 2010. Mr. O'Hagan and New York Times representatives didn't respond to requests to comment.
In July, Turkish human-rights activists criticized WikiLeaks for a Twitter message that linked to a cache of documents containing sensitive information belonging to private Turkish citizens. Some academics and activists also faulted the organization for including phone numbers, credit-card information and passport numbers in other data releases it published this year.
Such actions have eroded WikiLeaks' support among some advocates of transparency and privacy.
""Democratizing information has never been more vital, and @Wikileaks has helped. But their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake,"" said Mr. Snowden in a June Twitter message .
Rainey Reitman, a co-founder of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which helps people donate to WikiLeaks, said publishers, including WikiLeaks, have a right to publish leaks but ""do have a responsibility to think through the privacy ramifications of everything they put up online."" She noted that WikiLeaks doesn't conduct hacks itself, but publicizes material from hacks.
Backers of Russian President Vladimir Putin have pointed to the DNC emails as evidence that the U.S. isn't as democratic as it seems. ""In America, there has been a gradual evaporation of democratic institutions, a seizure of power by the establishment,"" Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political commentator, said when asked about the hack of the DNC earlier this summer.

Forget Drinking Games: The Final Presidential Debate Calls for Yoga; A guide to keeping calm once Clinton and Trump take the stage in Las Vegas,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1829787219?accountid=12768,"No matter whether you lean blue or red, the first and second presidential debates were stomach-churning experiences. The decline of civil discourse, the low popularity ratings of both candidates and the general feeling of gloom for U.S. democracy settled over living rooms, bars and Facebook comment threads.
Some viewers deal with debates using drinking games. We suggest a healthier alternative for Wednesday's third and final debate : yoga.
(Follow the Journal's live analysis of the final presidential debate.)
These poses, designed to keep you facing the TV, will help you cope with every interruption, accusation and revelation. Take it slowly, and don't forget to breathe.
The Everlasting Email
Lie facedown with the tops of your feet on the floor and palms down with bent elbows. Push the floor away until your arms are straight and your upper body is off the floor.
Strike this pose when someone brings up Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State. It won't remove all traces of anxiety, but it might help.
The Big Deduction
Lie facedown with legs side by side. Place your forearms on the floor parallel to each other with elbows under your shoulders.
Hold the position for as long as it takes to explain all the perfectly legal ways to rack up millions of dollars in tax deductions . Or until your arms give out.
The Locker-Room Pushback
Stand upright, arms reaching to the sky, then tilt forward at the waist and extend your right leg backward while balancing on your left leg.
Strike this pose when someone brings up Donald Trump's lewd comments about women in a leaked video, which he described as ""locker-room talk."" Side benefit of this pose: You can use your arms to cover your ears.
The Secret Speech
From a standing position, raise your arms then exhale and bend your knees until thighs are parallel to the floor.
Hold this pose as long as possible when someone asks how Hillary Clinton's paid talks to Wall Street bankers square with her appeals to the working class.
Anguished Elephant
Start on your hands and knees with your back flat. As you slowly inhale, let your belly drop while tilting your chest toward the ceiling. Exhale, and let your back rise until it's flat again.
Repeat as many times as Donald Trump says ""rigged.""
Downward Donkey
Start on hands and knees with a flat back. Exhale and round your back toward the ceiling, like a frightened Halloween cat.
This pose is for when Democrats remember that Hillary Clinton, despite leading in the polls, still has one of the lowest favorability ratings in the history of presidential politics.
(Note: Undecided voters can put their heads down and curl up into child's pose .)

Clinton Takes Command of A Changed Party --- Democrats are more liberal than those who helped elect her husband in 1992,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806403713?accountid=12768,"When Hillary Clinton accepts the Democratic nomination on Thursday, she will take command of a party that has little in common with the one she and her husband rode to the White House a quarter-century ago.
The party she will inherit is less white and more liberal. It is better educated and not as willing to compromise with Republicans. Many Democrats today aren't convinced capitalism is the best economic model or that socialism is taboo.
Nor is the party entirely sold on its new leader. A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll this month showed 45% of registered Democrats and those who lean in that direction would have preferred a nominee not named Hillary Clinton.
""I'm in the hold-your-nose-and-vote-for-Hillary-Clinton camp,"" said Jason Frerichs, a Democratic Party county chairman in southwestern Iowa.
Behind the party's evolution are seismic shifts that have threatened to sweep aside the pro-business, centrist brand of politics the Clintons long embodied. Those same forces could make it tougher for Mrs. Clinton to govern from the center should she win in November.
Working-class white voters once loyal to the Democratic Party have gravitated to the Republicans over the past two decades, drawn by the GOP's stance on guns, immigration and other social issues.
Amid the exodus, Democrats have moved left.
Only 30% of Democrats considered themselves liberal in 1994, the second year of Bill Clinton's presidency. That figure had nearly doubled by 2014, according to a study by the Pew Research Center.
With minorities, 20-somethings and college-educated voters making up a bigger chunk of the party, some Democrats are questioning tenets that once seemed inviolate. Take capitalism. An Iowa poll early this year showed more than four-in-10 likely Democratic caucus-goers in a state with an outsize influence on the nomination battle described themselves as socialist.
Watching these trends, some Democrats are uneasy. They fear the party will continue to lose state and local contests unless it makes an ideological course correction. For all of President Barack Obama's electoral success, the party lost more than 80 House and Senate seats under his watch.
""The party has moved steadily left because of the surge of liberal populism, and that has caused the party to be in complete free fall at the subpresidential level,"" said Jonathan Cowan, president of the centrist Democratic think tank, Third Way.
""The party is going to have to realize that to get and hold a sustained majority and enact solutions that are even remotely politically feasible, it's going to have to move toward the center,"" he said.
The draft party platform that Democrats approved at a two-day meeting in Orlando, Fla., highlights the sharp left turn the party has taken since Mr. Clinton held the White House 20 years ago.
The 1996 Democratic platform celebrated free-trade deals; the proposed new platform says they don't ""live up to the hype."" Bill Clinton's platform embraced the death penalty; the new one would do away with it. The old platform boasted of building new prison cells; the 2016 version calls for ""ending the era of mass incarceration.""
Eyeing the changes over the last generation, Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducts the Journal survey with Democrat Fred Yang, said: ""These are two radically different parties.""
Mrs. Clinton's campaign declined to comment.
She has signaled she isn't about to govern in accordance with her party's liberal faction. In naming a running mate, she passed over both Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the more moderate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.
Speaking to Charlie Rose of CBS News recently, she said: ""We are the center-left party.""
Yet, pressed by Mr. Sanders during the presidential primaries, Mrs. Clinton reversed course and came out against a 12-nation Pacific trade deal she promoted back when she was secretary of state. Hoping to win over his young supporters, she recently rolled out new plans to wipe out public-college tuition for millions of families.
She has inched closer to her primary rival's call for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Her allies on the platform committee in Orlando went so far as to include the $15 wage in the document.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, said in an interview: ""Everybody knows, including people who dislike her, that Hillary Clinton is a very intelligent person. And intelligent people pick up on where their supporters are and where the base is.""
Some of Mr. Sanders's supporters are pushing the party further left by running for office.
Mr. Frerichs, 39 years old, said that when he became chairman of Iowa's Montgomery County Democrats two years ago, he was the youngest person in the room.
That is no longer the case. He founded a progressive caucus within the Iowa state party that aims to elect liberals to school boards, county supervisor jobs, ""even dogcatcher,"" he said.
Tim Canova, a law professor with ties to the Occupy Wall Street movement, is challenging the ultimate symbol of the establishment, running for the south Florida congressional seat held by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
Ms. Wasserman Schultz said Sunday she would resign that position after the convention because of controversy over leaked internal emails in which DNC staffers appeared to be favoring Mrs. Clinton during the primaries.
Mr. Canova's campaign has a bit of the flavor of the Sanders operation, focusing on income inequality and climate change.""If I challenged her a few years ago, I wouldn't have stood a chance,"" Mr. Canova said. He is banking on voters seeing Ms. Wasserman Schultz as ""out of step at this point.""
Ryan Banfill, a spokesman for Ms. Wasserman Schultz, declined to comment on Mr. Canova but said the congresswoman is ""part of the fabric of that district.""
John Fetterman, mayor of the western Pennsylvania town of Braddock, jumped into the race for a U.S. Senate seat last fall. He is 6-foot-8 and 375 pounds, with nine tattoos on his right arm marking the dates of homicides that happened during his mayoral tenure.
With little money or name recognition, he competed for the Democratic nomination against more established candidates including Katie McGinty, a former chief of staff to the state's Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf.
Mr. Fetterman, who endorsed Mr. Sanders, lost to Ms. McGinty but wound up with 20% of the vote, exceeding expectations by winning the county that includes the city of Pittsburgh. He focused on hard-hit steel towns that have hemorrhaged jobs and population.
""Issues I care about like distressed communities are now more toward the forefront of the conversation,"" said Mr. Fetterman, who is considering another run for higher office.
The Democratic Party's liberal tilt creates a dilemma for Mrs. Clinton. Her instincts tend to be pragmatic. She has said she would spend time courting Republican lawmakers. But her party doesn't necessarily want a split-the-difference president.
Liberals are less inclined to compromise with Republicans than was once the case, according to a Pew Research Center study.
If Mrs. Clinton wins the White House and tries to appease the Democratic base, she risks more Washington gridlock. If she spurns her party's liberal core, she risks alienating a growing part of her governing coalition.
""It doesn't matter what's in the party platform,"" said Mr. Cowan of Third Way. ""She'll have absolutely no choice but to govern from the center, otherwise she'll have a dead presidency.""

U.S. News: Trump Aims to Rain on Clinton's Parade --- Republican will appear at town-hall meetings and vets event while Democrats convene,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806401067?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Donald Trump will try to steal some of Hillary Clinton's thunder during the Democratic National Convention here this week with a slate of swing-state appearances that will test the appeal of his new running mate.
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will join the GOP presidential nominee at stops in Virginia and North Carolina on Monday, Florida on Tuesday and Pennsylvania on Wednesday, according to a campaign schedule. Other GOP allies will hover around Philadelphia for counterprogramming during the Democratic gathering.
The Republican nominees in their travels will jointly appear at two town hall meetings, a rally, a national veterans' convention and what the campaign described as a Hispanic leadership round table.
The two men will then split up on the campaign trailas Mrs. Clinton takes the Philadelphia stage Thursday, aides to the New York businessman said. Mr. Pence will campaign with his wife, Karen.
Mrs. Clinton last week eschewed the tradition of letting the opposing party have the national stage during its convention, and campaigned in Ohio while the Republican gathering took place there. Clinton surrogates also traveled to Cleveland to push back against the frequent attacks on Mrs. Clinton at the GOP event.
Mr. Trump, in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC, underscored how far he is willing to limit immigration as an antiterrorism tool. He said immigrants from close allies such as France might be subject to the ""extreme vetting"" he proposes for those from nations he deems ""compromised by terrorism."" A Bastille Day terror attack in Nice, France, earlier this month killed 84 people.
Mr. Trump was clarifying comments he made at the GOP convention that some interpreted as narrowing his past proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. He more recently described a ban that looks not at religion but at what he says are the failures of countries to combat terrorism inside their borders.
""I actually don't think it's a rollback,"" Mr. Trump said. ""In fact, you could say it's an expansion. I'm looking now at territory.""
In coming weeks, Mr. Trump told NBC, he would unveil a detailed list of countries and territories from which immigrants would be subject to ""extreme vetting.""
Mr. Trump also threatened on NBC to pull the U.S. out of the World Trade Organization if membership in the global body interferes with his plan to impose penalties on companies that move U.S. production offshore.
The WTO threat appeared to mark a new level of attack on the global trading system that evolved in the postwar era. Mr. Trump previously denigrated the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, and a proposed Pacific trade pact.
In Philadelphia, national and state Republicanswere set to kick off their own messaging Sunday night, when Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort were on hand to talk to reporters.
The Pennsylvania GOP, meantime, is set to hold news conferences Tuesday and Wednesday to push back against Democrats, and flood call-in radio shows Thursday, a party spokeswoman said.
Republican attacks on Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic convention could help distract from lingering tensions within the GOP from Mr. Trump's spats with primary-season rivals who declined to endorse him: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who didn't attend the convention in his home state, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who gave a convention speech and was booed off the stage when he didn't endorse Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump indicated he doesn't plan to let the issue lie. He told NBC that he would back efforts to defeat Messrs. Cruz and Kasich and a third Republican whom he didn't name by generating funds to oppose them.
Mr. Kasich won re-election to a four-year term in 2014, and since Ohio imposes a two-term limit on governorships, it isn't clear Mr. Trump will have an opportunity to back a Kasich challenger. Mr. Cruz was elected to a six-year Senate term in 2012.

"Clinton Won the Battle, Sanders the War",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806391710?accountid=12768,"Bill Clinton took Democrats to the political middle. He met with Republicans to pass welfare-to-work laws and put more police on the streets. Barack Obama steered the party leftward with ""change we can believe in."" He promised to end long-running wars, deliver an economic recovery, offer medical coverage to the uninsured and unify an increasingly diverse nation.
Hillary Clinton will claim the Democratic nomination this week in Philadelphia, but the party is no longer defined by its standard-bearer. The energy rests instead with a rising generation of Democrats excited to use activist government to protect them in anxious economic times.
Older Democrats and minority voters provided a ""firewall"" that allowed Mrs. Clinton to defeat her rival in the primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Democrats who call themselves ""somewhat liberal"" went for Hillary by 13 percentage points, according to exit poll data analyzed by Public Opinion Strategies. ""Moderates"" backed her by 23 percentage points. But among the quarter of Democrats who see themselves as ""very liberal,"" she ran even with the socialist.
Bernie Sanders and his activist supporters have moved Mrs. Clinton and the party's platform to the left. The result is that the Democrats have taken on an identity that comes from a new base: voters under 40 who have no problem with Mr. Sanders's socialist vision. A 2015 study by the Pew Research Center found that 51% of millennials ""identify as Democrats or lean Democratic,"" compared with only 35% for Republicans. Two-fifths of millennials are people of color and immigrants.
This is not your father's -- or even your older sister's -- Democratic Party. It is far more left-leaning than under Bill Clinton or President Obama.
Almost 60% of Democratic voters agree that ""socialism has a positive"" impact on society, according to a February poll by OnMessage Inc. and the American Action Network. In Iowa 43% of Democrats said in January that they would use the word ""socialist"" to describe themselves, a survey by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics found.
Forty-seven percent of Democrats told Gallup last year that they are both ""socially liberal and economically moderate/liberal"" -- the highest level in the poll's history. In 2001 only 30% of Democrats described themselves that way. Between 2000 and 2015 the percentage of ""Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters"" who consider themselves liberal has gone up to 42% from 27%, according to a Pew study in February.
Mrs. Clinton has been running to the front of this liberal parade. This month she wrapped her arms around one of Mr. Sanders's biggest causes by backing tuition-free college at in-state public universities for families making under $125,000 a year.
She broke with Mr. Obama by calling for repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax on health-insurance plans, a priority for labor unions. She gave a sop to the teachers unions by backtracking on her decades-old support for charter schools. It is clear that in this new liberal order of Democratic politics, the unions will be the enforcers.
Mrs. Clinton is now even backing a ""public option"" -- a Medicare-style government program to compete against private insurance companies. This idea was so radioactive during the debate over the Affordable Care Act that Democrats jettisoned it for fear of being tarred as proponents of socialized medicine.
With the implicit support of Mrs. Clinton and her allies, the Sanders coalition added language to the Democratic platform calling to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, put a price on climate-altering emissions like carbon, and abolish the death penalty.
The party also stripped out language supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr. Sanders opposed during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton had once praised the deal a ""gold standard,"" but last fall she withdrew her support.
""It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,"" Mr. Sanders said this month as he endorsed her in New Hampshire. He correctly noted that the threat of a divided party had forced Mrs. Clinton to accept ""the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.""
Mr. Sanders then urged his supporters to keep the pressure on: ""Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency -- and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen."" The Vermonter has a stronger hand to play after the success of his populist campaign.
Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress have become more liberal -- the mirror image of what has happened to the GOP. Democratic incumbents who were defeated during the Obama years were largely centrists from red states: Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska.
After the 2012 election, much was written, including by me, about whether the Obama coalition of young people, blacks, Hispanics, gays and single women would keep Democrats in the White House for the near future. No one predicted that first of these core constituencies, young people, would become so vocally liberal.
A final factor is the GOP's strategy of unrelenting obstructionism against President Obama, which sparked a low-grade fury among the left wing. This is why Monday night's convention speaker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, gets hundreds of thousands of views every time she posts a fiery speech on YouTube.
Senate Republicans have refused to have a hearing, much less a vote, on Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even refused to give Mr. Garland the courtesy of a simple introductory meeting.
The result is that the bare-knuckle, activist-driven, take-to-the-streets politics of Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter is becoming the rule among Democrats. This month Senate Democrats blocked Republican efforts to defund so-called sanctuary cities and impose harsh prison sentences on undocumented immigrants.
History will record this week's convention as a coming-of-age for a new era of liberal Democratic politics. This is now Bernie Sanders's party: Other Democrats -- including Hillary Clinton -- are merely living in it.

Clinton Raises Kaine,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806391308?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton must not have been impressed by the Republican convention. In choosing Tim Kaine as her running mate late Friday, the Democrat is showing that she is so confident of winning in November that she can risk choosing a capable if conventional Senator who can help her govern perhaps more than he can help her win.
If she feared that Donald Trump might pull away millions of Bernie Sanders voters, she might have gone for an economic populist like Senators Sherrod Brown (Ohio) or Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts). If she worried about minority turnout, she might have gone with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker or a Hispanic. Instead Mrs. Clinton chose a 58-year-old white male, in a party that prizes identity politics above all, and a career politician in an antiestablishment year. She must believe Mr. Trump will be enough to scare her party into line behind her in the fall.
As a Senator and former Governor of Virginia, Mr. Kaine will help Mrs. Clinton nail down a swing state that both George W. Bush and President Obama won twice. As an establishment Democrat not from the Sanders wing of the party, the Senator may also reassure some college-educated Republicans who don't like Mrs. Clinton but can't abide Mr. Trump. Perhaps they'll vote for her rather than stay home or go libertarian.
Make no mistake, Mr. Kaine is a progressive on most policy issues. He is a Catholic who is personally opposed to abortion but supports abortion rights. He is also a feminist favorite who supports universal pre-K and government intervention to require equal pay for women. He has a 100% rating on Planned Parenthood's 2016 voting scorecard.
Mr. Kaine's economic record also tilts left and he has no problem raising taxes. In 2013 he introduced a bill to allow oil drilling off the Atlantic coast. But he voted against the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015, one of only 34 Democrats who did so, and even though his fellow Virginia Democrat Mark Warner voted yes.
More encouraging is his vote in 2015 for trade promotion authority. He spoke approvingly last week about the Pacific trade agreement, which Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump oppose. ""I am having discussions with a lot of groups around Virginia about the treaty itself. I see much in it to like,"" he said at a Virginia event Thursday. But on Saturday, after his VP selection, his spokeswoman told the press that he had changed his mind and decided to oppose it. Funny how that happens.
This flip-flop aside, Mrs. Clinton may have chosen Mr. Kaine to help her in 2017 if Republicans control Congress. As Governor he had to work with a GOP legislature. His main priority was transportation and public-works spending, which is likely to be a Clinton priority. If Mrs. Clinton wins with a Republican House, she will have to decide how much to compromise to get things done. Mr. Kaine has a winning personality and works comfortably across the political aisle.
Four more years of Mr. Obama's habit of executive rule and demonizing opponents would further polarize the country and leave her without much of a legacy. A President Clinton would need faster economic growth to have any chance of fulfilling her policy or political ambitions. Mr. Kaine is a shrewd governing choice -- if Mrs. Clinton is right about the election.",2016-10-20
"Some Undecided Voters Turn On Donald Trump Over 'Rigged' Claims; 'I just saw a constitutional crisis on television,' said a teacher, who won't vote for rival Hillary Clinton either",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1830218731?accountid=12768,"In the third and final presidential debate, Republican Donald Trump's refusal to say he would accept the results of the election was the last straw for at least some voters who had been struggling with their decision.
Bijan Sharifi, a 34-year-old high-school teacher, said he was horrified by Mr. Trump's comment during the debate that ""I will tell you at the time"" whether he would abide by the election's outcome. Mr. Trump has been warning for months about a ""rigged election"" and has stepped up those allegations recently as he has slipped in the polls.
""I just saw a constitutional crisis on television,"" said Mr. Sharifi, who said he intends to vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. ""That was mind-blowing. I'm afraid there's going to be terrorism and extremism after the election, and I don't think Hillary Clinton is the leader who will unify the country.""
Lori Long, a retired paper-mill worker in Clarkston, Wash., tuned into the final presidential debate hoping to give Mr. Trump one last shot.
Ms. Long, who voted for Republicans John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, said that she could never cast a ballot for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, but that Mr. Trump's remarks about potentially not accepting the results of the election, as well as about his treatment of women, turned her off for good.
""If I had to vote tomorrow, it still wouldn't be for either one of them,"" Ms. Long said. ""I am so against her it's just unbelievable. But I looked at him, and he opened his mouth, and that's enough to stop me right there. Would I want him as my president? God no, I wouldn't.""
Twenty days before the election, with two of the most unpopular presidential nominees in history, some voters were unsure of what to do, even after watching the final debate.
The debate brought Rick Saucier, a real-estate broker in Orlando, Fla., one step closer to a decision. He ruled out Mrs. Clinton once and for all, because of what he said was her non-response to a question about the emails hacked by WikiLeaks from her campaign manager's private account. ""If I've made up my mind, it's about despising Hillary Clinton,"" said Mr. Saucier, who voted for the last two Republican nominees. ""I think so little of her. She doesn't answer questions.""
Some voters, turned off by the vitriolic tone of the first two presidential debates, tuned out of the third one entirely.
""I'm not voting for either of those candidates anyway, and I just figure it's just going to be more of the same nonsense,"" said Garrett Thacker, 30, who works at a car dealership in Galloway, Ohio. He said he plans to cast a ballot for independent candidate Evan McMullin.
Ben Robinson, 33, a project manager for a custom home builder in Houston, also avoided the final presidential debate. He has settled on the Libertarian, Mr. Johnson. ""I just really don't care about what either of them has to say anymore,"" he said.
""If I had to choose, I guess I would rather end up getting stuck with Hillary,"" he added. ""I disagree with just about everything she says, but that's politics. Trump--he's just dangerous.""
So who are the undecided voters in America?
About 8% of the electorate declined to choose either nominee or a third-party candidate in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Most of them prefer a Republican-controlled Congress, suggesting they lean Republican but can't abide Mr. Trump. They also tend to be female and younger.
One development that may help Mrs. Clinton in the homestretch of the race is that she has improved her public image among the voters, while Mr. Trump hasn't.
Through most of the year, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have had the distinction of being the least-liked major-party nominees in modern history.
That's still true of Mr. Trump. Negative views of Mr. Trump outweighed positive ones by 33 percentage points in this week's Journal/NBC News poll, about the same as in other recent surveys.
For Mrs. Clinton, negative views outweighed positive ones by 10 percentage points in the poll released this week. That's an improvement from April, when negative views of Mrs. Clinton outweighed positive ones by 24 points.
The change leaves George H.W. Bush as the most unfavorably viewed nominee in recent history, after Mr. Trump.

Main Street: Mrs. Clinton v. Mr. Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806558754?accountid=12768,"When her husband was running for president in 1992, Hillary Clinton appeared by his side on ""60 Minutes"" to help him rebut claims he'd had a sexual relationship with Gennifer Flowers.
When asked if he ""categorically"" denied the allegation, Mr. Clinton responded ""I've said that before."" Just to clarify her own role, Mrs. Clinton added, ""I'm not sitting here -- some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.""
Each was fibbing. In a deposition in the Paula Jones case years later, Mr. Clinton admitted that his relationship with Ms. Flowers had been sexual. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, would spend the next eight years in full Tammy Wynette mode, standing by her man through all the women and all the lies.
Which makes this year's convention in the City of Brotherly Love even more of a triumph for Mrs. Clinton. Not only is she the Clinton whose name sits atop the party's presidential ticket this time, in some ways the entire Democratic convention is a repudiation of all things Bill.
Start with the platform. Now, it's true that platforms are not binding, but they give a good sense of how parties and candidates see themselves. Notwithstanding the ""lock her up"" chants from Bernie supporters here in Philly, Mr. Sanders says of the prevailing draft that ""we now have the most-progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.""
It's hard to recall these days, but Bill Clinton's 1992 platform and presidency were once thought to deliver the Democratic Party from precisely this kind of thinking. Back then, Mr. Clinton was the face of the ""New Democrat"" who aimed to persuade the American people Democrats had changed from the McGovern days and could be trusted on values, the economy and national security.
In 1992, the party of Bill Clinton called business a ""noble endeavor."" Its platform sounded downright Paul Ryanish, listing its ""first priority"" as ""broad-based, non-inflationary economic growth and the opportunity that flows from it."" And it declared its opposition to ""the adoption of new programs and new spending without new thinking.""
In his administration, Mr. Clinton would work with Republicans to pass welfare reform and repeal the Glass-Steagall provisions forbidding affiliations between banks and securities firms. He would sign the North American Free Trade Agreement. And in his 1996 State of the Union address, Mr. Clinton would declare that ""the era of big government is over.""
In 2016, the party of Hillary Clinton has chucked all this overboard, embracing a plethora of new programs and spending. It has come out for ""free"" college education and a government health-care option. Mrs. Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest trade deal since Nafta. For this Clinton, the era of big government is back.
Nor is the rejection of Bill Clinton limited to economics. In 1992, when a Washington Post interviewer asked hip-hop artist Sister Souljah about black-on-black violence during that summer's riots in Los Angeles, she answered that ""if black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people."" At a Rainbow Coalition event sponsored by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Clinton likened her to the white supremacist David Duke.
In 2016, by contrast, the Democratic Party of Mrs. Clinton has gone all in with the Black Lives Matter movement. This includes accepting the false idea that black men are being shot because of institutional racism among our men and women in blue.
Ditto for social issues. In his acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic convention, Mr. Clinton famously said that abortion should be ""safe, legal and rare."" In 2016, the party of Mrs. Clinton has thrown out ""rare"" for the most-extreme position possible: abortion on demand subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer.
Gone too is the call for a more muscular approach to foreign policy, a theme Bill Clinton used to criticize George H.W. Bush as too weak. ""I believe our nation has a higher purpose than to coddle dictators and stand aside from the global movement toward democracy,"" said Mr. Clinton.
Now, it's possible that on Russia and NATO, Mrs. Clinton may repeat the weakness argument, given Donald Trump's refusal to see Russian President Vladimir Putin's aggression as a threat. But the Middle East is a better indicator of where her party has moved.
In 1992, the party of Bill Clinton chided the Bush administration for not being an ""honest broker"" and encouraging Arabs to believe the U.S. would deliver ""unilateral concessions"" from Israel. Though Mrs. Clinton's allies have beaten back (for now) efforts to be more critical of Israel, the battle is a proxy for the party's larger distrust of American force and the distancing from traditional U.S. allies that has characterized the two Obama terms.
This is Mrs. Clinton's moment. So out goes Tammy Wynette, and all that 1992 Bill Clinton talk of getting ""two for the price of one."" In the Democratic Party of Hillary Clinton, the left wing is back in charge. And it's as much a repudiation of her husband as it is of Mr. Trump.

"Clinton Wins Historic Nomination --- After Tough Battle, A Landmark Moment",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806998134?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Hillary Clinton became the first female presidential nominee of any major party on Tuesday, a historic milestone that sets the stage for a battle to prove to voters that she is someone they can trust in the White House.
The second day of the Democratic National Convention was designed to offer reassurance to an electorate that has watched her on the national stage for more than two decades as first lady, then U.S. senator and secretary of state.
The validators tapped to send that message ranged from her vanquished primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, to her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
Late in the evening, Mrs. Clinton briefly addressed the convention via a video feed, appearing after an animated pane of glass shattered. ""I can't believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet,"" she said to cheers.
Mrs. Clinton, who was defeated by Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic nomination, proved to be a resilient campaigner in her second presidential bid, yet she also displayed campaign vulnerabilities that Republicans will look to exploit.
Chief among them are likability and trust. Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling has shown that both Mrs. Clinton and her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, are disliked by more voters than any nominee in the past quarter-century.
Asked why many voters distrust her, Mrs. Clinton has often said Republicans have sought to demonize her and subjected her to unfounded attacks. But she hasn't always helped her own cause. For months, she defended her use of a private email account and server during her tenure at the State Department. FBI Director James Comey criticized her email arrangement as ""extremely careless,"" but said he wouldn't recommend the Justice Department pursue criminal charges.
Polls showed voters haven't bought her explanations, and Mrs. Clinton later said the move was a mistake and vowed not to repeat it.
Reversing voters' negative sentiment fell to one of the party's most persuasive speakers. Mr. Clinton highlighted Mrs. Clinton's skill as an agent of change, recalling her work in Arkansas developing preschool programs and her efforts to overhaul the health-care system early in his presidency.
""She's insatiably curious, she's a natural leader, she's a good organizer, and she's the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life,"" he said.
Mr. Clinton added: ""Some people say, well, we need change, she's been around a long time. She sure has, and she's sure been worth every single year she's put into making people's lives better.""
And describing her activism as a young law student, he said: ""Hillary opened my eyes to a whole new world of public service by a private citizen.""
He ran through a narrative of their lives together, from the multiple times she rejected his marriage proposals to dropping daughter Chelsea off at college, during which Mrs. Clinton obsessed about installing paper liners in her daughter's dresser drawers.
Referring to last week's Republican National Convention, in which most speakers attacked his wife and the delegates chanted ""lock her up,"" Mr. Clinton called their depictions a ""cartoon"" version of Mrs. Clinton that the Republicans made up because the ""real"" one is too tough to beat.
""Life in the real world is complicated, and change is hard,"" he said.
Other speakers reinforced Mr. Clinton's message, including former President Jimmy Carter, former Attorney General Eric Holder and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
The evening also featured speakers who talked about her lower-profile efforts to help people coping with illness, loss and tragedy, and the mothers of seven black men killed in high-profile cases that sparked community outrage.
Mr. Sanders nominated Mrs. Clinton, sparking roars of approval from the crowd, a sign that the deep divisions that ran through the delegation just a day earlier were being smoothed over.
The Clinton campaign gave Mr. Sanders three nominating speeches for his candidacy, a roll call that counted his votes, and a moment that paid homage to his remarkable, insurgent candidacy. But a group of several dozen Sanders supporters left the convention floor after the roll call vote and conducted a sit-in in the media filing center.
Noman Khanani, a Sanders delegate from Massachusetts, said Mr. Clinton's more personal portrait could help bring skeptics into the fold -- but only within limits. ""I'm still bitter but we're supporting party unity,"" he said. ""Bill's speech did a good job to humanize Hillary and win back that trust.""
A question facing the Clinton campaign is whether she can reshape public perceptions at a high-stakes moment late in her political career.
As far back as the early 1990s, when Mrs. Clinton first appeared on the national stage, her advisers worried that she was seen as a tough, partisan figure. Pollsters wrote a memo to Mr. Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992 laying out ways to ""reduce voters' discomfort with Hillary.""
""She knows she has work to do to earn people's trust,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior Clinton adviser.

"Clinton Wins Historic Nomination --- For Some Women, Gender Isn't Enough",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806997973?accountid=12768,"The nomination of Hillary Clinton marked a step forward in the fight for equality in postwar America that illustrates the strides made by women since the former first lady was born in 1947.
The irony -- and the problem for Mrs. Clinton -- is that such progress has become so widespread that some women voters appear indifferent to another glass ceiling shattered. More women graduate from college than men. They are the main breadwinners in four of 10 U.S. households. They run General Motors Co., PepsiCo Inc. and IBM Corp.
Mrs. Clinton, who was formally picked Tuesday evening as the Democratic nominee, has struggled to lock up support from middle-aged white women. And some younger women see little urgency to crash barriers they haven't encountered.
While 52% of registered female voters from both parties support Mrs. Clinton the proportion falls to 36% among white women ages 50 to 64 and 34% among white women ages 35 to 49, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this month.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is supported by 37% of all women in the poll, 54% of white women ages 50 to 64, and 51% of those women ages 35 to 49.
""What bothers me the most is that there's not very much excitement about Hillary being the first woman,"" said 72-year-old tennis champion and Clinton supporter Billie Jean King, especially not when compared with the enthusiasm of Americans during the campaign to elect Barack Obama as the first black president.
Concerns about Mrs. Clinton include the revelation she used her personal email for government purposes while serving as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton has said she made a mistake but didn't break the rules set at the time.
Reservations and resentment also linger from the Clintons' service in the White House during the 1990s, when her husband, President Bill Clinton, was impeached for lying in the investigation of his affair with a White House intern.
Conservatives part ways with Mrs. Clinton on such issues as abortion rights, and liberals assert she has been too cozy with Wall Street.
""I think we have gotten away from the historic nature of this campaign because Hillary Clinton has become an exceptionally polarizing candidate,"" said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
Mrs. Clinton's highest levels of support among all women registered to vote, including Republicans, are from those ages 65 and older -- 56% -- and 66% for ages 18 to 34. Millennials are among the most liberal voters.
""The younger generation expects that there will be a woman president, expects that they will do any single thing that they want,"" said Sherry Lansing, 71 years old, who became the first female president of a movie studio at Twentieth Century Fox in 1980. She is backing Mrs. Clinton.
A mid-2015 list counted 24 female chief executives at Fortune 500 companies, the same number from the prior year, raising concerns of stalled progress.
When Ms. Lansing grew up in Chicago in the 1950s, she said, women were told they had two career choices: teacher or nurse. And those professions were often seen as placeholders until marriage and children. It wasn't, she said, until Gloria Steinem agitated for equal treatment of women in the 1960s that she saw a different path.
Progress came in fits and starts during Mrs. Clinton's lifetime. When Hillary Rodham was born in Chicago, eight women served in Congress.No state had a female governor. The president's cabinet was all male.
Democrat Patricia Schroeder was elected to the House of Representative in 1972, pushing the number of women in Congress to 16 of 535 seats. When she launched her first congressional campaign, a local newspaper published the headline: ""Housewife announces for Congress.""
""There's nothing wrong with being a housewife,"" Ms. Schroeder said in a recent interview. ""But I was an attorney.""
Her family bought a house in Virginia after the election, she said, and Ms. Schroeder wasn't permitted to sign the closing papers because she was of childbearing age. When Ms. Schroeder needed supplies for her office, she couldn't secure a credit card in her own name.
""You've got to be kidding me -- I just got elected to Congress,"" she said. ""We got busy and passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.""
Former Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole entered Harvard Law School in 1962 and was one of 24 women in a class of 550. Mrs. Dole, who later served as a cabinet secretary in two administrations, said a male classmate asked: ""What are you doing here? Don't you realize you're taking the place of a man who would give his right arm to be in this law school, a man who would use his legal education?""
In 1973, retired tennis champion Bobby Riggs asserted that the men's game was superior to women's tennis and challenged Ms. King to a match dubbed the ""Battle of the Sexes."" She beat him soundly.
When the 2016 presidential field became dominated by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, Ms. King said, it reminded her of that match. ""Bobby talked, talked, talked, talked, talked,"" she said. ""He couldn't get enough attention. Does that remind you of anybody?""
A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, said: ""The difference is that Bobby Riggs choked, and Mr. Trump never chokes.""
Unease with Mrs. Clinton has colored this historic moment. WSJ/NBC polls over the past 10 years found Americans more enthusiastic about electing a female president. But when respondents were asked their support of Mrs. Clinton in that role, their enthusiasm is dimmed from a decade ago.
""It never occurred to me that a woman couldn't be president,"" said Susan Willes, a 53-year-old undecided Democrat and nurse from Timonium, Md. ""I don't feel like I have to vote for a woman just because she's a woman.""
Nancy Pelosi, who became the first female House Speaker in 2007, said she expects Mrs. Clinton to win, not because ""it's time"" to elect a woman president, but because she is the best choice.
Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said one of the milestones that helped pave a path for Mrs. Clinton was former U.S. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful Democratic run for vice president in 1984. Now, three decades later, Ms. Goodwin said she was surprised it has taken so long to reach this point.
Sending a woman to the White House, Ms. Goodwin said, ""may make a difference in terms of young girls seeing this happen, and then they can picture themselves doing it.""
Mrs. Clinton has embraced the history-making component of her candidacy after shying away from it during her 2008 campaign. Eight years ago, she and her advisers concentrated on showing she was prepared to be president, making only occasional mentions of the historic nature of her candidacy.
During this campaign, she told voters that if standing up for women's issues ""is playing the women card, then deal me in.""
Mrs. Clinton celebrated clinching the last of the delegates needed to win the nomination at a rally in Brooklyn last month, saying her ""campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings, no limits, on any of us.""

"The Democratic Convention: Economic Messages Reveal Tensions --- Clinton trumpets gains and policy proposals, as party's progressives focus on shortcomings",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806997803?accountid=12768,"Headline speakers at this week's Democratic convention are offering jarringly different visions of the state of America's economy, revealing one of the harder questions for presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to answer this fall: How good is the economy, anyway?
President Barack Obama regularly emphasizes a job-creation record that he says has made the U.S. recovery the envy of the world. But progressive leaders, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, highlighted a litany of economic shortcomings in prime-time speeches on the convention's kickoff night, including what Mr. Sanders called a ""grotesque"" level of income inequality.
Despite progress, ""we can all agree that much, much more needs to be done,"" Mr. Sanders said.
This tension animates Mrs. Clinton's economic message, which highlights the upswings under both the Clinton and Obama administrations while offering policies shaped by perceived shortcomings of those expansions.
Mrs. Clinton has called for a big infrastructure-spending package to boost growth, along with other proposals that rely on tax credits, regulations and other policy nudges to ensure more households benefit from economic expansions. She wants to expand paid family leave and sharply reduce what Americans pay in college tuition.
The question is whether the sum of her ideas will motivate voters during a season of robust antiestablishment appeal.
Nominees typically put forward policy proposals with enough specifics to claim a mandate and push their plans through Congress after the election. Mrs. Clinton is following that script with a platform culled from think tanks and experts, but she is up against an opponent, Donald Trump, who says voters don't care about detailed policies and offers only broad aims that are largely untethered from the Republican Party's longtime ideology.
Republicans, too, have faced divisions, but party regulars said Mr. Trump has broad appeal to conservatives and independents. ""It's especially stark when people see how far left the Democratic Party has gone to accommodate Bernie Sanders,"" said Judd Gregg, a former New Hampshire governor and senator.
Mrs. Clinton's proposals are aimed at updating U.S. policies and laws to reflect how people live and work today, said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to the campaign
""She's laid out an agenda that she believes is achievable, and that's important,"" he said. ""This is not some sort of tempering of our ambition because we think it's achievable.""
Officials who backed Mr. Sanders, her primary rival, say the platform approved at the convention is the most progressive in modern times. They want Mrs. Clinton to override instincts that some say have made her too cautious.
The platform takes on ""inequality [and] a campaign system being corrupted by special-interest money,"" said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.). ""I hope she will recognize there is room politically to take on these issues.""
There is little doubt that Mrs. Clinton takes over a much-changed party.
The financial crisis shattered confidence in markets and curbed the party's embrace of Wall Street that began under Mr. Clinton in the 1990s. Difficulty in translating steady job gains under Mr. Obama into higher incomes for Americans complicates Mrs. Clinton's effort to run on an otherwise sturdy economic record.
""What we've learned since the 1990s is that economic growth is necessary, but not sufficient,"" said Alan Krueger, the Princeton University economist who chaired Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
Populist impulses coursed through both parties' primaries. Mr. Trump steered Republicans away from their focus on limited government and free trade, but Mr. Sanders pulled Mrs. Clinton toward the party's liberal base.
Mr. Sanders channeled frustrations into a serious primary challenge. Under pressure, Mrs. Clinton moved his way on some issues. She also rejected the Pacific trade deal she had lauded as Mr. Obama's secretary of state.
Barring a crisis, Mrs. Clinton can point to a modestly expanding economy with unemployment below 5%. Some 49% of respondents in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said the economy had improved and that Mr. Obama deserved some credit, while 36% said the economy had not improved. Whether she stands to benefit is an open question.

The Democratic Convention: Clinton Opposes Trade Vote This Year,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806997800?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- The chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign said Tuesday she opposes a congressional vote on a pending Pacific free-trade agreement later this year and said she wouldn't seek to simply tweak the language if she became president.
John Podesta said Mrs. Clinton and her newly minted running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, have been clear about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.
""They're against it before the election and against it after the election,"" he said at a Wall Street Journal lunch. He said he met with House Democrats, who overwhelmingly oppose the pact, on Monday and reiterated that position. ""So they know, they well know what our position is.""
Before he was picked as running mate, however, Mr. Kaine had said there was much about the trade bill that he liked. And he was among senators who voted for a trade promotion authority measure that helped the Obama administration to complete negotiations on the TPP.
Asked if Mrs. Clinton would seek to renegotiate the agreement but keep the overall structure, he said no. ""We're not about renegotiation,"" he said. ""We're interested in a new approach.""
Mrs. Clinton has supported some trade pacts in the past, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which her husband signed, and she previously called the TPP the ""gold standard"" while she was secretary of state and it was being negotiated.
After the deal was completed last year, she came out against it, saying it didn't assure American wages would rise, among other concerns.
Still, some Democrats who are deeply opposed to free-trade deals have worried that once elected she will get behind the trade agreement, which is strongly supported by President Barack Obama.
Mr. Obama is still hoping for congressional approval during his term, potentially during a ""lame duck"" session late this year, after the election. Opponents are pressuring Mrs. Clinton to clearly oppose that strategy.
On Monday, at the Democratic National Convention, delegates on the floor waved anti-TPP signs, and some chanted ""no TPP!"" Her general election opponent, Republican Donald Trump, is also a strong opponent of the pact.
Asked whether Mrs. Clinton would seek to block a lame-duck vote, Mr. Podesta, a former Obama adviser, said: ""What the president chooses to do, whether he thinks that that's an effective strategy, is up to him, but that is not our strategy.""

Clinton's Trade Opportunism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806996255?accountid=12768,"Opposition to free trade is fueling the protests at the Democratic convention this week, and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren elevated protectionism nearly to an official Philadelphia theme on Monday. By Thursday the spectacle may include Hillary Clinton, though her trade pandering is treacherous politics and undermines her claim to be the superior statesman to Donald Trump.
The cause of open trade is at a low ebb amid the rise of the Sanders-Warren progressives and the Trump tariff right, plus a lack of leadership in Washington. The latest trade liberalizer to recant is Tim Kaine, who said as recently as last Thursday that the Pacific Rim trade deal is ""a significant improvement over the status quo,"" only to declare his opposition after becoming Mrs. Clinton's running mate.
Mr. Trump is now assailing Mr. Kaine for Herbert Hoover-come-lately hypocrisy, and he has a point. As Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton helped negotiate the yet-to-be-ratified Trans-Pacific Partnership and gave some 45 public speeches for TPP. Then to fend off the Sanders challenge, she renounced the final TPP text in October 2015, and getting tough on China, outsourcing and other specters became stump staples. By opposing TPP, she's running against the last major initiative of a President of her own party, and the Philadelphia Democrats don't seem to mind.
More remarkable is that no one takes her statements at face value. Her left-right critics think she's setting up a trade double cross, while corporate CEOs assure us that she is merely making a tactical TPP feint and after the election she'll push it through Congress.
This perception of trade insincerity does match the Clinton record. In the 1990s her husband promoted the North American Free Trade Agreement and most-favored nation status for China, and she endorsed both in her 2003 memoir ""Living History.""
In the 2007-2008 Democratic primaries, Mrs. Clinton said she would renegotiate the ""mistake"" that was Nafta, promised to defeat a pending deal with Colombia, and told an AFL-CIO town hall that a U.S.-South Korea pact would ""put American jobs at risk."" At Foggy Bottom, she then lobbied Congress to pass the Colombia and Korea agreements, and she deleted her Nafta do-over faster than the emails on her private server.
The Democrat is now bowing deeper than ever to protectionist forces. After Mr. Trump gave an America First speech in June, the Clinton campaign responded in a press release that his rhetoric was ""reckless"" and his ""incoherent approach"" would ""throw our economy into a recession."" Except for those minor details, the campaign added that he was stealing ""Hillary's best ideas,"" which ""seem to have moved straight from Hillary Clinton's policy fact sheets to his teleprompter.""
So is the inner Hillary now a junior-achievement Donald? Who knows? Maybe this time she really has rolled left along with the Democratic Party and she means what she says, in which case she enjoys no particular pro-trade or pro-growth advantage over Mr. Trump.
But if Mrs. Clinton is merely triangulating again, then please spare us the lectures about ""recklessness."" Other than pacifying the Warren-Sanders wing, Mrs. Clinton's new posture gains her little or no 2016 advantage. She can't outbid Mr. Trump on protectionism, one of the few policy matters that has sustained his attention since the 1980s, and his subtlety-free TPP opposition has already locked down most single-issue voters.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton is damaging prospects for the 12-nation Pacific deal, if only by validating the claims of its opponents. This will make it harder for her to pass it if she is elected, especially if she lacks the will to face down the anti-trade caucus she is now indulging.
Assuming Mrs. Clinton still believes as she used to claim that TPP is critical for U.S. competitiveness and to balance China's growing influence in the Asia-Pacific, she is undercutting its already dire chances in Congress. She is also knee-capping Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has made TPP central to his economic reform agenda.
Nearly seven of 10 voters tell pollsters they think Mrs. Clinton is untrustworthy, and the reason is no more mysterious than her political character. She'll say or do anything to get elected, even if means ""evolving"" from pro-trade first lady to anti-trade presidential candidate to pro-trade Secretary of State to anti-trade candidate back to allegedly pro-trade President.
Mrs. Clinton's cheerleaders says she's the responsible candidate who knows better, but the evidence for this is awfully thin.",2016-10-24
"Russian Hackers Evolve to Serve the Kremlin; Attacks on Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Committee are part of Vladimir Putin's effort to sow instability, U.S. officials say",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1830301581?accountid=12768,"With the hacking of Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee, U.S. officials say Russia has unleashed a strengthened cyberwarfare weapon to sow uncertainty about the U.S. democratic process.
In doing so, Russia has transformed state-sponsored hackers known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear from internet spies to political tools with the power to target the country's adversaries, according to U.S. officials and cybersecurity experts.
The attacks are the harder side of parallel campaigns in the Kremlin's English-language media, which broadcast negative news about Western institutions and alliances and focus on issues that demonstrate or stoke instability in the West, such as Brexit. Moscow seeks particularly to weaken the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has expanded its defense against Russia.
""The underlying philosophy of a lot of these attacks is about establishing information as a weapon,"" said Alexander Klimburg, a cyber expert at the Hague Center for Strategic Studies. ""Hacking for them is literally about controlling information.""
President Vladimir Putin denies Russian involvement in the hacking, but in a way that telegraphs glee about the potential chaos being sown in the U.S. democratic process.
""Everyone is talking about who did it, but is it so important who did it?"" Mr. Putin said. ""What is important is the content of this information.""
Former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden said the Kremlin doesn't appear to be trying to influence the election's outcome, noting Russian involvement has provided fodder for both Republicans and Democrats. ""They are not trying to pick a winner,"" he said Tuesday at a cybersecurity conference in Washington. Rather, Russia is likely unleashing the emails ""to mess with our heads.""
Pro-Kremlin commentators in Russia have seized on the DNC leaks to cast doubt on the American democratic process and argue that Washington has no right to criticize Moscow. They have said the hacked DNC emails, which showed party officials working to undermine primary runner-up Bernie Sanders, prove Americans are hypocritical when they malign Mr. Putin's authoritarianism.
The White House has threatened a ""proportional response"" against Russia.
Retaliating against murky cyberattackers is uncertain new territory, Western officials said. The group often called Fancy Bear has been active since at least 2007 or 2008, experts say. Multiple security companies have given the group different code names including Pawn Storm, Sofacy, and APT 28, which denotes an ""advanced persistent threat.""
Another group, known as Cozy Bear or APT 29, has taken a lower profile, often targeting higher-profile individuals and uses more sophisticated tools to cover its tracks, cybersecurity experts said. It was active as early as 2008 and 2009, with targets related to Chechnya, a U.S.-based think tank and government institutions in Poland and the Czech Republic, according to security firm F-Secure Corp.
The methods are well known: Hackers trick targets into providing account information or downloading infected files through expertly faked emails and webpages, a tactic known as spear-phishing.
The link to Russia's security apparatus is based in part on technical clues. The two groups' malware is deemed too sophisticated for most criminal gangs. Cyrillic script appears in some of the code Fancy Bear used to hack targets in Ukraine in 2015, according to Romanian security firm Bitdefender. Samples of some Cozy Bear malware showed they were generally compiled during business hours in Moscow.
Yet it is the groups' selection of targets that offers the most compelling evidence of Russian involvement, cybersecurity experts say. Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear have generally focused on NATO and allied governments, officials in Eastern Europe, and Western defense groups, such as Academi LLC, the U.S. security firm previously known as Blackwater. In many cases, the information they siphon off aligns closely with Russian interests.
""This all adds up to a strong indication of Russian sponsorship,"" said Laura Galante, director of global intelligence at U.S.-based security firm FireEye Inc. and a former Russia specialist at the U.S. Department of Defense. ""The Russian government has very publicly stated its desire to have ability in this realm. They want the ability to shape the way people think about events.""
Fancy Bear's early efforts were mostly unremarkable and under-the-radar, typical of state-sponsored actors, said Brian Bartholomew, a researcher at Kaspersky Labs. Targets included Georgia's Ministry of Defense and Eastern European governments and militaries, according to FireEye.
But since around 2014, when Russia's annexation of Crimea set off a confrontation with the West, the group has expanded its activities, often in apparent response to news events. In that shift the groups combine traditional spycraft with the public impact of leaks such as those by WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden, who now lives in Russia.
Fancy Bear was behind the hacking alias CyberBerkut, cybersecurity experts said, in attacks that targeted Ukrainian ministries, its presidential elections and posted hacked documents online. The group has been linked to 2014 hacks of Polish government websites, spear-phishing aimed at U.S. and European militaries, the 2015 hacking of Germany's parliament and other attacks in the West.
More recently, private security companies said that Fancy Bear was behind hacking of the DNC and the leaking of athlete information from the World Anti-Doping Agency in September. The leak following the Rio Olympics sought to show U.S. athletes got unfair prescription-drug exemptions just as some Russian athletes were barred from the Olympics over claims of systemic Russian doping violations.

The Democratic Convention: A Fifth of Democrats Not Sold On Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807465628?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Hillary Clinton headed into the biggest speech of her political life Thursday night suffering from a more negative image within her own party than any previous Democratic presidential nominee on the eve of the party convention in the last quarter century, a new analysis of Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling shows.
Only her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in 1992 comes even close.
Republican pollsters Bill McInturff and Brian Fraser found that 20% of Democratic voters surveyed in July had negative feelings about Mrs. Clinton. In 1992, on the eve of Mr. Clinton's nomination, 19% viewed him negatively. Among the rest of the Democratic presidential nominees between the Clintons, none had a negative rating higher than 10%.
Not all Democrats who view Mrs. Clinton negatively will be willing to vote for her over Republican Donald Trump, but some will: Another analysis -- of data collected in May-July surveys -- found that 34% of Democrats who view her negatively would vote for Mr. Trump, while 39% would vote for her.
The pollsters also found in that May-July analysis that the Democrats who view Mrs. Clinton negatively are more likely to be young, liberal and dissatisfied with the direction of the country. Of those who view her negatively, 89% believed the country is on the wrong track -- even more pessimistic than the electorate as a whole, among whom 71% see the country on the wrong track.
Almost one-third of the Democrats who feel negatively about Mrs. Clinton are under 30, even though they made up only 18% of the voters surveyed. And 40% of them are liberals, a category that accounts for just 27% of voters surveyed.
Democrats are hoping the convention will help improve Mrs. Clinton's image. Her husband's experience offers some hope: Heading into his 1992 convention, he was viewed positively by 47% of Democrats and negatively by 19%. After the convention, his image improved to 68% positive and 11% negative.

The Democratic Convention: Candidates Clash Over Foreign Policy --- An issue-by-issue look at how Clinton and Trump would deal with allies and foes,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807465516?accountid=12768,"The next U.S. president will confront a deeply unsettled world, with the Middle East in turmoil, Europe struggling to contain an outbreak of terror attacks and Russia expanding its influence. Here's a look at where the two presidential nominees, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, stand on a few key foreign-policy challenges.
Russia
Under President Vladimir Putin, Russia has sought to expand its power and international clout, often in ways that have heightened tensions with the U.S. Russian hackers have penetrated computer networks all over the world, including in the U.S. Russia has also threatened its neighbors in recent years.
Mr. Trump has floated the idea of creating a new alliance with Russia, saying a reset of relations is necessary to help ease tensions in Syria and elsewhere. Mr. Putin has said complimentary things about Mr. Trump, leading some to suggest a close bond between them, which Mr. Trump has denied. This week, he invited Russia to unearth some of Mrs. Clinton's emails from her time as secretary of state, a statement alarming lawmakers from both political parties.
Mrs. Clinton has called Mr. Putin a ""bully,"" and has described the relationship between the U.S. and Russia as complicated. As secretary of state, she worked to broker more cooperation between the two countries, posing in 2009 with Mr. Putin for a photo-op in which they pushed a big, red ""reset"" button. By the end of her tenure, she warned in a memo to President Barack Obama that relations with Russia had hit a low point and the ""reset"" in relations was over, according to people who saw the document.
NATO
U.S. relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization mark one of the biggest differences between the two, with Mr. Trump saying the U.S. is paying too much to keep the alliance afloat, and Mrs. Clinton portraying it as vital to U.S. interests in Europe.
Mr. Trump wants allies within NATO to pay more for the overall protection of Europe. He has suggested the U.S. might leave the alliance if that doesn't happen during a Trump presidency. He also said NATO was obsolete and had to shift its focus away from Russian deterrence and more toward dealing with terrorism and migration flows.
Mrs. Clinton says that leaving NATO would only embolden Moscow. She has praised the existence of the alliance and said the U.S. should do more to strengthen allies, particularly against Russian aggression. She has said that NATO allies rallied to the U.S.'s aid after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and that the U.S. should be prepared to do the same.
Islamic State
The rise of the terror network Islamic State since 2013 has reshaped how the U.S. and other countries view Muslims and confront terror. It has also opened sharp divides between the candidates.
Mr. Trump has said he won't give a fully detailed plan to defeat Islamic State, also known as ISIS, because it would take away the element of surprise. But he has said he would ""bomb the shit"" out of the group's oil operations. He said it could take 30,000 U.S. troops to defeat ISIS in the Middle East, but he hasn't committed to deploying a force of that size. To deal with suspected terrorists, he has proposed changing international rules that forbid the military's use of torture.
Mrs. Clinton has said Sunni Muslims and Kurdish forces should play a bigger role in combating ISIS, and has also called for expanding U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to defeat the terror network. She has called for combating Islamic State's ability to use social media to recruit, train, and plan attacks, urging more cooperation from tech firms.
Immigration
Immigration has emerged as one of the most divisive issues of the 2016 campaign, with Republicans reversing course from an earlier push to enact a bipartisan overhaul of immigration rules. The focus has shifted in recent months to immigration rules for people fleeing places like Syria and other unstable regimes in the Middle East.
Mr. Trump has called for building a roughly 1,000 mile wall, financed by Mexico, to secure the U.S.'s southern border. He has said the threats posed by Islamic extremists are too dangerous and that stark new measures must be put in place to bar entry to Muslims from certain countries. He has called for ending ""birthright citizenship,"" which is the legal process for granting citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.
Mrs. Clinton has said banning the entry of Muslims into the U.S. -- even the proposal of it -- will alienate Muslim allies in the Middle East and harm U.S. relations.
She has called for a comprehensive immigration overhaul, including a pathway to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally, aside from violent criminals.

Clinton Makes Her Pitch --- Candidate Underlines Contrasts to Rival,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807464030?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for president Thursday, casting herself as a leader whose steadiness and unifying approach stand in sharp contrast with her opponent.
Her speech to a raucous convention crowd repeatedly slammed Republican nominee Donald Trump as unfit and someone who ""loses his cool at the slightest provocation."" She referenced his own words from last week's Republican convention.
""Don't believe anyone who says 'I alone can fix it,'"" she said. ""Americans don't say: 'I alone can fix it.' We say: 'We'll fix it together.'""
But she also recognized that many Americans don't like her much, either, and suspect she's out for herself. Her speech -- and the entire week's convention -- aimed to improve her image with stories about her family and her early work for children. She said her interest in the details of policy matter to the people they affect. ""I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me,"" she said.
Mrs. Clinton spoke for 57 minutes, 18 minutes fewer than Mr. Trump's speech in Cleveland last week.
Mrs. Clinton leaves the Democratic National Convention with a largely unified party, set for an election that will test whether she can lead them to a third term in the White House. Her chief challenges include convincing Americans dissatisfied with the slow and uneven economic recovery and fearful of a spate of new terrorism attacks that staying the course is better than betting on the unpredictable agenda of Mr. Trump.
To win over skeptics, Mrs. Clinton outlined a plan to boost jobs, particularly for workers whose incomes have stagnated since the 2007 recession. Her immediate priorities, she said, would including a large increase in infrastructure spending, an immigration overhaul, new gun restrictions, paid family leave and significant new subsidies to make public college tuition-free for most families.
She said she would fund her plans with tax increases on Wall Street, corporations and the ""super rich.""
""Some of you are frustrated, even furious. And you know what? You're right,"" Mrs. Clinton said of Americans facing economic challenges.
Democrats argued all week that the New York billionaire was temperamentally unfit for the job. Taking note of turbulence and terrorism across the globe, Mrs. Clinton cast herself as the person prepared to be commander in chief.
""Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,"" the former secretary of state said. Given the turbulence and terrorism across the globe, she said Americans are ""looking for steady leadership.""
Mrs. Clinton also drew an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump's recent comments that he might not defend NATO allies if they don't keep their financial commitments. ""I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia,"" she said.
Mr. Trump's fiery message of unfairness and decline in America has resonated with white, working class voters in particular. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton's goal was to paint a more hopeful, optimistic vision of a nation that comes together and is, as her campaign slogan puts it, ""stronger together.""
To underscore that message, the evening roster of speakers included a pair of Republicans and Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim U.S. soldier from Virginia who was killed in Iraq.
""Donald Trump, you're asking Americans to trust you with their future. Let me ask you: have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy,"" Mr. Khan said. ""Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending United States of America. You'll see all faiths, genders, and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing.""
In her introduction, Chelsea Clinton spoke in personal terms about her mother's care and devotion to her -- soccer games, a dinosaur park, notes left behind to open while she was out of town. ""That feeling of being valued and loved -- that's what my mom wants for every child,"" she said.
Mrs. Clinton's task was complicated by the passions stirred by her former primary rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders,who drew millions of supporters with his outrage over income inequality and campaign against the political and financial establishment.
While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders made their peace ahead of the convention week, his supporters sporadically protested his defeat outside and inside the Wells Fargo Center.
A June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll underscored Mrs. Clinton's challenge in following fellow Democrat Barack Obama's two terms. Asked if they wanted the next president to take a steady approach to the way government operates or to bring major changes even if it isn't clear what those changes will be, 56% favored change compared with 41% who wanted a steady approach.
""Hillary Clinton cannot afford to simply embrace the status quo, but must show that there will be a separate route for the country's future,"" said Peter Hart, who co-directs the Journal/NBC News poll.
Ed Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania and a Clinton backer, described the sort of voter who might be drawn to Mr. Trump: a welder who once earned $80,000 a year and is now bagging groceries. ""If you're hurting, it's hard to convince you (to) keep the people who are in,"" he said.
Mrs. Clinton aimed to address those concerns, partly in personal terms. As she has many times on the campaign trail, she told the story of her mother, who was abandoned as a young girl and got by on the kindness of others. ""No one gets through life alone,"" she said. ""We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.""

Clinton Makes Her Pitch --- Nominee to Take On Trump in Rust Belt,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807463912?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Hillary Clinton's first order of business after the Democratic convention is a bus trip in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Ohio, the opening move in a strategy to defend her party's grip on states President Barack Obama won and to brand her rival as unfit to be president.
It shows a campaign eager to close off a likely effort by Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, to build an Electoral College majority by winning working-class, white voters in the Rust Belt and other slowly diversifying states. Democrats hope to capitalize on a convention that has drawn stronger television ratings so far than those for the Republican convention last week.
Initially viewing Mr. Trump as possibly the weakest general-election candidate in the Republican primary field, Mrs. Clinton's allies now accept that the campaign will be a slog. Polling shows the two candidates are running about even in the popular vote.
""I fully expect this to be a close and competitive election all the way through the end,"" said Geoff Garin, a pollster and strategist in Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.
Mrs. Clinton has used the convention to address a basic vulnerability: Voters largely don't trust or like her. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this month showed that 20% of Democrats have a negative view of her -- a higher number than for any Democratic nominee in the last quarter-century.
A string of convention speakers from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to President Barack Obama, told stories during the convention meant to show a warmer, more empathetic face of the former secretary of state, senator and first lady.
As Mrs. Clinton tries to make an affirmative case for herself, another clear goal of the Clinton campaign is to undercut Mr. Trump, who himself is viewed negatively by a majority of voters, by raising concerns that he is so temperamentally unstable he can't be trusted with the nuclear codes.
John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, told reporters this week that the way to win is to demonstrate Mr. Trump is ""unfit, that he's unprepared and that we can't put him in the Oval Office."" He added: ""That's the core of our strategy.""
Republicans counter Mrs. Clinton's persona is a liability. Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman, said in an interview: ""This is not an election about policy and ideology. It's an election about, 'What do I think of you as a leader.' She has a lot of qualifications, but they just don't trust her or like her. That's hard"" to overcome.
Mr. Trump's campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Clinton aides are looking at the electoral map in granular detail to plot the best path to 270 electoral votes. It's no accident that Mrs. Clinton is planning a trip on Monday to Omaha. Under Nebraska's unusual system, candidates can pick up Electoral College votes by winning specific congressional districts. Mr. Obama picked up one electoral vote in 2008 by capturing the district that includes Omaha.
The campaign also hopes to retake North Carolina, a state that Mr. Obama won in 2008 but lost in 2012. Mrs. Clinton has made repeated trips to the state -- the latest to Charlotte on Monday.
Even Utah might be in play. Robby Mook, the Clinton campaign manager, said this week that the traditionally Republican state, which hasn't voted for the Democratic nominee since 1964, is a ""heavy lift."" But he added that Mr. Trump created ""headwinds"" for himself, having ""alienated the Mormon Church.""
At a rally in Utah in March, Mr. Trump questioned whether the 2012 GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, was truly a Mormon.
""While I think it's going to be a close election in terms of the popular vote, she does have a distinct advantage in terms of the Electoral College map,"" Mr. Garin said. He said that she has ""many more pathways"" to an Electoral College majority than Mr. Trump has.
For Mr. Trump to win, he would need to flip some states that Democrats have been winning, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, which helps explain why Mrs. Clinton's bus tour starts in those two states, said David Axelrod, a former Obama White House and campaign adviser. ""He's trying to put this together primarily among white voters,"" Mr. Axelrod said.
Mrs. Clinton will start her bus tour accompanied by Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.), her running mate. A roster of high-profile campaign surrogates also will stump for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama's political team has been coordinating closely with the Clinton campaign and expects the president to be a frequent presence on the trail in the fall. With a job approval rating topping 50%, Mr. Obama can be particularly helpful in mobilizing minority voters and getting them to vote.
Mark Penn, a senior strategist in Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential race, said, ""She now has an almost unprecedented team of surrogates, from President Clinton, who is great with swing voters, to President Obama, who can fire up the base and whose ratings have been rising.""

Obama Rallies Democrats for Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807235525?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- President Barack Obama, with the end of his own presidency in sight, vouched for Hillary Clinton in a speech Wednesday intended to rebut Republican criticism of her record as secretary of state and elevate her as a tested leader at a time when national security is taking a central role in the presidential campaign.
""Nothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office,"" Mr. Obama said in the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. ""You don't know what it's like to manage a global crisis or send young people to war. But Hillary's been in the room. She's been part of those decisions.""
On the third day of the convention, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, Vice President Joe Biden and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined Mr. Obama in blasting Republican nominee Donald Trump, attacks sure to be echoed as they fan out on the campaign trail.
In an address that marked a symbolic transfer of Democratic political leadership, from the first African-American president to the first woman to become a major party's nominee, Mr. Obama also addressed Americans who are skeptical about Mrs. Clinton's trustworthiness.
""She's made mistakes, just like I have. Just like we all do,"" he said. ""That's what happens when we try.""
Mr. Trump opposes many of the policies Democrats put in place since 2009, including the health-care law, climate-change measures and the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Obama's aides have said one of the president's motivations for aggressively campaigning for Mrs. Clinton is his belief that Mr. Trump would undo those and other policies.
Throughout the night, Democrats painted a brutal portrait of Mr. Trump as a businessman who is out for himself, not others; who has no knowledge of world affairs or interest in learning; and who has a temperament too uneven to exercise leadership at home and abroad.
""America is already great,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And I promise you, our strength, our greatness does not depend on Donald Trump.""
In accepting the vice presidential nomination, Mr. Kaine, who peppered his speech with Spanish, made a case for Mrs. Clinton, but also railed against Mr. Trump.
""Folks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth,"" said Mr. Kaine. ""Our nation is too great to put it in the hands of a slick-talking, empty-promising, self-promoting, one-man wrecking crew.""
Mr. Biden said he has known Mrs. Clinton for more than three decades as an advocate for the middle class and derided Mr. Trump on that score: ""He cares about the middle class? Give me a break. That's a bunch of malarkey.""
He also said the Republican nominee is exploiting voter fears of terrorism. ""He has no clue about what makes America great,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Actually he has no clue, period.""
Mr. Bloomberg said Mrs. Clinton would be a ""problem solver, not a bomb thrower."" He said in his dealings with Mrs. Clinton ""we didn't always agree"" but she ""always listened and that's the kind of approach we need in Washington today.""
Mr. Obama's appearance came a day after delegates officially nominated Mrs. Clinton and largely set aside lingering tensions between her supporters and those of her primary rival Bernie Sanders. Senior administration officials said Mr. Obama called Mr. SandersTuesdaynight to thank him for helping facilitate the show of party unity.
The president sought to reinforce Mrs. Clinton's narrative that her command of national security issues makes her a more solid choice for voters than Mr. Trump. He described how he leaned on her during some of the most critical moments of his presidency, including when he weighed whether to authorize the mission that killed Osama bin Laden.
And he cast her as the only candidate who has fought for middle class Americans, drawing a stark contrast with the dim outlook of the country during the Republican convention last week.
""What we heard in Cleveland last week wasn't particularly Republican -- and it sure wasn't conservative,"" Mr. Obama said. ""What we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, and turn away from the rest of the world. There were no serious solutions to pressing problems -- just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate.""
The Republican National Committee has spent much of this week attacking Mrs. Clinton on her foreign policy record.
Her ""judgment is on trial, not her experience,"" said Richard Grennel, former spokesman for the United Nations during a Republican National Committee's news conference here. ""A surgeon who has been a surgeon for 25 years but has botched surgery should not be called a great surgeon.""
Mrs. Clinton's supporters hope highlighting her experience on foreign policy and national security issues at a time of rising anxiety over terrorism could swing to her voters considering Mr. Trump.
Polls show voters have more confidence in Mrs. Clinton as a world leader. Asked in a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll which candidate would be better at handling foreign policy, 30% of voters said Mr. Trump and 54% said Mrs. Clinton.
On which candidate would be better as commander in chief, 32% said Mr. Trump and 44% said Mrs. Clinton. But on homeland security and combating terrorism, Mr. Trump was favored 44% to 39%.
Mr. Trump, in his GOP convention acceptance speech last week in Cleveland, set a dark tone with dire warnings of national and international peril. Mr. Obama, by contrast, said ""I am more optimistic about the future of America than ever before.""
After Mr. Obama wound up his speech declaring, ""I'm ready to pass the baton,"" Mrs. Clinton walked onto the stage. The two onetime rivals warmly embraced, waved to the cheering crowd and held hands to raise their fists in the air as Stevie Wonder's ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours"" played. They exited the stage with their arms around each other's waists.

Will Clinton Decry Her Own Money Machine?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807218480?accountid=12768,"This week's Democratic convention has featured a nonstop string of speakers vowing to crack down on ""big money"" in politics. They will presumably get serious about this project in December, or only after all the ""big money"" in 2016 has helped put Hillary Clinton into the White House.
To listen to the prime-time speakers here in Philly, there is no greater threat to democracy than the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United, which struck down some limits on political speech. Progressive firebrand Bernie Sanders used his Monday night address to deride it as ""one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country,"" which allows ""the wealthiest people"" to buy elections and move the country toward ""oligarchy."" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren echoed that with her own promise that this election is all about getting ""big money out of politics"" by overturning Citizens United so as to ""return this government to the people.""
The theme follows on Mrs. Clinton's high-profile vow to propose, within 30 days of taking office, a new constitutional amendment that will ""overturn"" Citizens United. That's another way of saying the Democratic nominee intends to gut the First Amendment, putting government in charge of who precisely can speak in elections.
It's a dangerous pledge, but also one that is hard to swallow coming from a woman who has spent the past decades building -- via the Clinton Foundation -- one of the most ruthlessly efficient big-money machines ever witnessed in politics. And successfully so, given that the real ""big money"" to be found this presidential-election season is all solidly behind Democrats. Donald Trump's fundraising woes are by now a central factor in the race, as many traditional high-dollar donors remain reluctant to go all in for his candidacy. Mrs. Clinton's campaign and its allies, meanwhile, are on track to break records by potentially spending $1.5 billion. Mr. Trump's side might prove lucky to raise a third of that.
Who is filling this Democratic war chest? A Tuesday story in Politico reported that billionaire George Soros has given or committed $25 million for Hillary and other Democrats. That includes more than $7 million to Priorities USA Action, a super Pac supporting Mrs. Clinton, and $2 million to American Bridge 21st Century, a super Pac devoted to opposing Republicans.
Finance reports show that billionaire and green activist Tom Steyer has donated $31 million to Democratic causes this year. (That's far less than the $74 million Mr. Steyer blew in 2014, but the year is young.) The list of Democrats' superdonors goes on. Entertainment mogul Haim Saban: $11 million. Media baron Fred Eychaner: $11 million. Hedge-fund manager Don Sussman: $13 million. Add in the multimillion-dollar checks from the Pritzker family (of Hyatt hotel fame); James Simons (hedge-fund billionaire); and Herbert Sandler (banking baron).
The Sanders fans on the left may well believe in their anti-money cause. But Mrs. Clinton's world has long been that of the 1%. Though she may feel compelled to chase progressive voters by signing up for their campaign against Citizens United, don't assume she thinks getting rid of ""big money"" is good for elections or democracy. What Mrs. Clinton believes is that getting rid of her opponents' money is good for her.

The Other Clinton 'Change',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807218013?accountid=12768,"Bill Clinton on Tuesday portrayed his wife as a ""change maker"" whose life has overflowed with good intentions and commitment to others. No one can spin a yarn like Bill, and for the believers it was a touching portrait. But if it's true, why do the polls show that 68% of Americans don't trust Hillary Clinton? That has to do with the rest of the story, which is how the Clintons have used politics to enrich themselves and retain power.
Nowhere is this clearer than at the words you didn't hear Mr. Clinton speak: the Clinton Foundation. This supposedly philanthropic operation has become a metaphor for the Clinton business model of crony politics. The foundation is about producing a different kind of ""change.""
No doubt the foundation does some charitable good, but this is incidental to its main purpose of promoting the Clinton political brand. Since its creation in 1997, the nominal nonprofit has served as a shadow Super Pac, designed to keep the Clintons in the national headlines, cover their travel expenses, and keep their retinue employed between elections.
The payroll has included Huma Abedin, who drew a State Department salary even as she managed politics at the foundation and is now vice-chairwoman of the Clinton campaign. Dennis Cheng raised money for Mrs. Clinton's 2008 bid, then became the foundation's chief development officer and now leads Mrs. Clinton's 2016 fundraising. Cheryl Mills, Hillary's chief of staff at State, sat on the foundation board. And don't forget Sid Blumenthal, the longtime Clinton Svengali who was secretly advising Mrs. Clinton at State while drawing a foundation salary. This may not be illegal but the charity here is for the Clintons' benefit.
The funding for this political operation has come from nearly every country and major company in the world. These contributors have the cover of giving to charity, when everybody knows the gifts are political tribute to a woman determined to be President. Donations to a charity aren't governed by the same caps or restrictions as those that go to a traditional Super Pac. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren somehow overlooked this in their Monday night riffs against money in politics.
Witness the charitably minded donors from Algeria, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The Swiss bank UBS gave more than $500,000 to the foundation after Secretary Clinton solved its IRS problem. Canadian mining magnate Ian Telfer used a family charity to donate millions to the foundation at the same time a Cabinet committee on which Mrs. Clinton sat was reviewing (and ultimately greenlighted) a Russian mining deal involving his company. According to the Washington Post, Bill Clinton received $105 million for 542 speeches between January 2001 (when he left the White House) and January 2013 (when Hillary stepped down from State), often from companies and countries with business before State.
The foundation also rewards Clinton friends and political allies. This newspaper reported in May that the Clinton Global Initiative (a foundation program) directed a financial commitment to a company, Energy Pioneer Solutions, part-owned by Clinton friends. In 2010 Canadian tycoon Frank Giustra, a foundation donor, won the right to cut timber in Colombia, not long after the Clintons met with Colombia's president.
There are no doubt other examples we don't know about because the Clintons have hidden foundation details until they are exposed in the press. The foundation had to admit that it continued to accept donations from foreign governments while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State, though she had promised not to do so. The Associated Press reported this month that the official calendar Mrs. Clinton kept at State publicly omitted at least 75 meetings she held with ""longtime political donors, Clinton Foundation contributors, and corporate and other outside interests.""
Keep in mind that the Clintons did all this after their ethical travails of the 1990s and knowing Mrs. Clinton would run for President again. It's as if the lesson they learned from the 1990s isn't that they should cut fewer corners but that they can get away with anything. And maybe they can.",2016-10-25
How Clinton Will Try to Build on ObamaCare; Phil Gramm worries that Hillary Clinton plans to push for a single-payer health-care financing system once elected president. We can only hope!,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1832005770?accountid=12768,"Phil Gramm worries that Hillary Clinton plans to push for a single-payer health-care financing system once elected president (""Where Clinton Will Take ObamaCare ,"" op-ed, Oct. 18). We can only hope!
The only way to have affordable and adequate care that doesn't exclude the sick and the marginally poor is a taxpayer-funded system that would expand Medicare to cover all Americans. As long as 15-30 cents of every dollar we spend on private insurance goes toward profit, marketing and exorbitant executive compensation, it will be impossible to achieve reasonable cost and universal coverage.
We already spend more than twice as much per capita for health care than any other country and have nowhere near the best outcomes. I would be surprised if a President Hillary Clinton pushes for a single payer, but good for her and us if she does.
Gerald Gollin, M.D.
Solana Beach, Calif.
Contrary to Phil Gramm's excellent op-ed, the HillaryCare single-payer ""Goliath"" will more likely be public-corporate cartels having the facade of private insurance.
HMO/ACO (accountable-care organization) cartels protected by government sovereignty are now being created through 2011 Federal Trade Commission waivers of antitrust laws. The cartels are enabled to collude in price fixing, franchising and ""gainsharing"" profits through Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waivers of antifee splitting and antiself-referral laws. Further, the 2015 ""doc fix"" law legalizes coercion of clinician gatekeepers at the nation's bedsides to profit the cartels.
Order ""too much"" and gatekeeper pay is deceased--a ""negative payment adjustment""; order less and pay is increased--a ""bonus opportunity."" This is fed-speak for volume (or utilization) pay; it is not for ""quality"" or ""value"" pay. Doctors not playing corporate-cartel gatekeeper roles will be out of the income stream.
Mr. Gramm is correct. Goliath ""reforms"" will continue with Hillary Clinton.

"Hillary Clinton, Underdog",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808023150?accountid=12768,"After what even critics said was a highly effective Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton appears to have emerged as . . . the underdog.
Conventional wisdom has long held that Mrs. Clinton will capture the White House in November, regardless of the challenges her candidacy faces. With three months to go, that calculus looks shaky. The 2016 election is trending toward Donald Trump.
Yes, the race has been fluid and will likely remain so. Mrs. Clinton might get a solid convention bounce. But even in the best-case scenario, it seems unlikely to surpass Mr. Trump's own bounce -- five to six points in some polls, which is greater than President Obama's in 2008 or 2012. The Republican's boost is largely the result of Mr. Trump's successful speech in Cleveland. Fifty-seven percent of those watching had a ""very positive"" reaction, and 56% said that they were more likely to vote for him. You'd never know it from listening to the mainstream press, which condemned the speech as ""dark.""
Right now the momentum points in one direction: Mr. Trump's. The race is tied in the Real Clear Politics polling average, which represents a reversal in his fortunes of three to four points. Earlier this week, with the GOP convention still fresh, Mr. Trump had the clear advantage and edged ahead of Mrs. Clinton. As polls during the first days of the Democratic convention began to be factored in, a statistical tie emerged.
It's too soon to say whether the final two days of the Philadelphia confab will change the dynamic. But there has been clear movement to Mr. Trump in the past month. Look at the CNN/ORC poll for a four-way race, including the Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein. Mr. Trump has gained seven points since mid-July and now beats Mrs. Clinton 44% to 39%, with Mr. Johnson at 9% and Ms. Stein at 3%. In a head-to-head matchup, the Republican wins 48% to 45%.
Mr. Trump's lead is more than double that in an LA Times/USC survey released this week, which shows him winning 47% to 40%. And in the CNN/ORC poll he's up by 18 points with independents -- one reason why former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was enlisted to deliver an impassioned speech Wednesday in Philadelphia.
Nate Silver's 538 ""now-cast"" -- meant to simulate what would happen if Election Day were today -- also shows clear movement in Mr. Trump's direction. Only a month ago, Mr. Silver gave the Republican about a 20% chance of winning. That has risen to a 47% chance. Mr. Silver still gives Mrs. Clinton better than even odds of becoming president, but that's down significantly from a few weeks ago.
Mr. Trump is surging as well in swing states, where he is now slightly ahead, within the margin of error, or at least within striking distance. The Real Clear Politics polling average for Florida puts the GOP nominee up by 0.3 percentage points. In Ohio he is down by 0.8 points. And in Pennsylvania he trails by 4.4 points.
This is pretty astounding, considering that Clinton & Co. has spent $57 million on ads thus far -- $25 million from the campaign and $32 million from super PACs. Team Trump has put up only $3.6 million in ads, all from outside groups.
Mrs. Clinton's campaign is weighed down by other factors. Her negatives have reached their highest point yet. Recent Gallup polling shows that 38% of Americans view her favorably and 57% unfavorably. That's her worst score since 1996, before she entered politics in her own right, and a far cry from the 69% approval she enjoyed in The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll when she left public office in 2013.
Americans still don't trust her. This week's CNN/ORC poll found that only 30% of voters say she is honest and trustworthy and 68% say she isn't, her worst rating in that survey. To put these dreadful numbers in perspective, consider that even Mr. Trump is beating her. Forty-three percent of voters find him honest and trustworthy, a five-point increase since the GOP convention. This despite that PolitiFact rates his statements ""false"" or ""pants on fire"" more than 50% of the time.
It's also unclear whether Bernie Sanders's supporters will come out in force for Mrs. Clinton. A Bloomberg poll last month found that barely half of Sanders backers said that they would support the Democratic nominee. Eighteen percent said they would go for Mr. Johnson, the Libertarian, and 22% for Mr. Trump.
Most fundamentally, Mrs. Clinton must contend with the fact that about 70% of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction -- traditionally a fatal indicator for a party trying to hold the White House. Bill Clinton benefited from this dynamic in 1992, when 76% of Americans felt this way, and that is what made him president. A poll this month from YouGov shows that, despite years of steady (if anemic) economic growth, 55% of Americans think the country is still in recession. Mr. Obama's touting of his record in an otherwise terrific speech will fall on deaf ears.
Indeed, we should view the Democrats' superficially successful convention with a more critical eye. Without question, the party made great political theater. Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, the president and Mrs. Obama all delivered powerful speeches that, as a Democrat myself, I found effective. Mrs. Clinton's speech, a laundry list of party talking points, was workmanlike but didn't rise to the same heights.
Yet on the substance Democrats showed themselves to be out of sync with the American mood. Except for touting the killing of Osama bin Laden five years ago, the convention included almost no mention of terrorism until the last two nights, when Democrats chanted ""U.S.A."" and repeatedly asserted that the American military is the strongest in the world.
The ebullient tone doesn't harmonize with more than 80% of voters who say, according to a Fox News poll last month, that Americans aren't confident in the nation's ability to prevent a terrorist attack. Democrats' reluctance to discuss Islamic State -- with the exception of Leon Panetta, who was booed -- is profoundly troubling. ISIS is striking Europe regularly, and fears are mounting of more attacks at home. No surprise that voters prefer Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton on fighting terrorism, 50% to 46%, according to Gallup.
The Democrats did try to close this gap by bringing 25 military officers onto the stage. Mrs. Clinton, too, offered a sharp critique of Mr. Trump's national security ideas. But she didn't mention radical Islam. It's an open question whether this last-minute pivot to national security will make a difference.
Democrats also failed to offer any specific plan to create jobs or promote economic growth. Mr. Obama says he's optimistic, but few voters share that feeling. Up to two-thirds of Americans are looking for change. For many, Mr. Trump makes a powerful case. Merely calling Mrs. Clinton a ""change maker,"" as her husband did, isn't going to cut it in this environment.
The Democrats seem to be coming to grips with the dangers they face, however. All the prime-time speakers in Philadelphia went negative on Mr. Trump. President Obama called him a ""homegrown demagogue"" and Vice President Biden added that the Republican is ""clueless."" After months of denying that the New York businessman had any chance to win, Mr. Obama told the ""Today"" show this week that ""anything is possible.""
Mr. Trump is no sure thing, but he begins the general-election campaign as a slight favorite. He's still volatile, always one sentence away from a controversy. His joke this week that Russian hackers should help find Mrs. Clinton's lost emails made more than a few people uneasy. His negatives are cripplingly high, at 70%, and he is on track to be outspent more than 3 to 1. He has yet to build an effective campaign organization and begins at a considerable disadvantage in the Electoral College. At this point, he'll probably have to depend on his rhetorical skills to win the debates, and ultimately the election.
That said, few believed Mr. Trump could win the Republican nomination, and few believed he would pull ahead of his Democratic opponent in the polls. He has now done both, and he has the issues and the national mood behind him.
I have worked for both Clintons -- Bill in his 1996 presidential campaign and Hillary in her 2000 Senate campaign. No one knows better than I do that they understand how to fight and will do what it takes to win. The question is whether that will be enough. Hillary Clinton -- and the Democrats -- are now battling uphill.

The Clinton campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee both were targets in cybersecurity incidents, along with the Democratic National Committee, which recently saw a trove of hacked emails released after an attack.
Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said an analytics data program used by the campaign had been accessed as part of the breach at the party's headquarters. The program was maintained by the DNC and had been available to the Clinton campaign and other entities.
Outside cybersecurity experts have found no evidence that the campaign's internal computer systems have been compromised, Mr. Merrill said.
The newly revealed breach is part of what cybersecurity and federal investigators believe is a broad pattern of hacking attacks directed by Russian intelligence, according to an official close to the investigation.
U.S. authorities have now found several instances of successful penetrations and expect to find more, according to the official.
Earlier on Friday, the DCCC, the House Democrats' campaign arm, confirmed it had been hacked in an incident likely similar to the breach at the party's main headquarters.
A DCCC spokeswoman said the organization had been the ""target of a cybersecurity incident,"" and that it had brought on CrowdStrike, a forensic investigator, to assist it in addressing the incident.
""Based on the information we have to date, we've been advised by investigators that this is similar to other recent incidents, including the DNC breach,"" Meredith Kelly, spokeswoman for the DCCC, said. ""The DCCC takes this matter very seriously. With the assistance of leading experts, we have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network in the face of these recent events.""
She said the DCCC was working with federal law-enforcement officers in the probe.
The hacking follows revelations in June that the Democratic National Committee's network had been breached. Earlier this week, President Barack Obama for the first time tied Russia to the DNC hacking, saying ""experts"" believe hackers from there carried out the operation.
Russia has denied involvement in the DNC hacking.
DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned from her DNC post Sunday after emails released Friday by the WikiLeaks website showed DNC officials had worked to undermine the presidential campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Election 2016: Hedge Funds Back Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807864251?accountid=12768,"Corrections & Amplifications
The Center for Responsive Politics says hedge funds and private-equity firms have given $27.6 million in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. A Wall Street Journal analysis of the data using a broader category than the center's found seven financial firms have given $47.6 million for Mrs. Clinton. An Election 2016 article Saturday about financial firms' political donations incorrectly gave the analysis total as $48.5 million. The contribution figure of about $19,000 from hedge funds and private-equity firms arrived at by the Journal for Republican nominee Donald Trump was the same as the center's figure.
(WSJ August 4, 2016)
Hedge funds are playing a far bigger role in 2016 than in past elections -- and Hillary Clinton has been the single biggest beneficiary.
Owners and employees of hedge funds have made $122.7 million in campaign contributions this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- more than twice what they gave in the entire 2012 cycle and nearly 14% of total money donated from all sources so far.
The lines around what constitutes a hedge fund aren't always clear. But the numbers are stark. The top five contributors to pro-Clinton groups are employees or owners of private investment funds, according to federal data released last week and compiled by OpenSecrets.org, the center's website. The data show seven financial firms alone have generated nearly $48.5 million for groups working on Mrs. Clinton's behalf.
The total for Donald Trump: About $19,000.
Mr. Trump, of course, didn't start actively soliciting campaign contributions until recently and shunned support from outside political groups, which, unlike candidates' campaigns, can accept unlimited donations. Hedge-fund employees have contributed heavily to other Republican groups this cycle -- $65.8 million so far -- mainly in support of candidates who opposed Mr. Trump in the primaries. Some who had supported other GOP candidates are now beginning to give to pro-Trump groups.
Still, Mrs. Clinton's big haul from hedge funds also reflects the topsy-turvy politics of this election. In the 2008 campaign, hedge funds contributed just $14 million to Democratic candidates and groups. And amid criticism that Mrs. Clinton has close ties with the finance industry, her campaign has emphasized her plan to confront Wall Street.
""Hillary Clinton has the toughest plan to reform Wall Street, clean up the abuses . . . and close the carried-interest [tax] loophole that benefits hedge funds,"" a campaign spokesman said.
That said, to many on Wall Street, the Democrat in this election is the safer bet.
""There are two reasons I've given more than ever before,"" said J.B. Pritzker, managing partner of private investment firm Pritzker Group, who has given $7.9 million to pro-Clinton groups. ""First, I think she ought to be president. Second, I want to defeat Donald Trump. I believe that he would be terrible for the country.""
Other multimillion-dollar donors to groups backing Mrs. Clinton include Haim Saban, who controls Saban Capital Group; Renaissance Technologies LLC founder James Simons; George Soros of Soros Fund Management, and Paloma Partners founder Donald Sussman.
Some Wall Street executives have privately expressed concerns about Mr. Trump, particularly the developer's business record and positions on trade and foreign policy. They say he strikes them as unpredictable and untested. The Trump campaign didn't respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Trump does have supporters in the financial industry. Billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross said he recently hosted a fundraiser for Mr. Trump that raised ""millions of dollars, much of which was from the investment community.""
Mr. Ross said he is backing Mr. Trump because he agrees with the Republican nominee's positions on trade, defense spending and immigration.
And the co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, Robert Mercer, now plans to help fund a group that supports Mr. Trump. Mr. Mercer has previously given mainly to a group backing Mr. Trump's GOP rival Sen. Ted Cruz.
But there are no hedge funds or similar investment firms among Mr. Trump's top contributors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Hedge funds with owners or employees that did contribute to Mr. Trump's campaign include James River Capital, which gave $1,000; SkyBridge Capital, $267; and Second Curve Capital, $260.
SkyBridge's Anthony Scaramucci, who co-hosted a fundraiser for Mr. Trump last month, said hedge-fund managers were making a mistake by backing Mrs. Clinton.
""The hedge-fund community has been wrong about a lot this year,"" he said. ""You can add this to the list.""

Clinton Expands Lead Over Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809029981?accountid=12768,"Republican Donald Trump showed signs that he is trying to get his campaign back on track amid a series of recent missteps, as a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Democrat Hillary Clinton opening a 9-point lead nationally over the New York businessman.
Mrs. Clinton's lead, at 47% to 38%, grew from 5 percentage points before the conventions in July. The finding comes as Mr. Trump and anxious Republicans are trying to shift focus away from GOP infighting and personality politics.
At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday, a more restrained Mr. Trump read parts of his speech from notes and kept his attention trained on Mrs. Clinton.
""Hillary Clinton can never be trusted with national security,"" he said, which elicited cheers of ""Lock her up!""
The Journal/NBC News poll of 800 registered voters was taken after both parties' national conventions and after Mr. Trump became mired in controversy for criticizing Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier killed in the Iraq war. He stirred additional tensions within his party this week by refusing to endorse the re-election of House Speaker Paul Ryan in next week's primary, capping one of the rockiest stretches of Mr. Trump's campaign.
The decline in Mr. Trump's national standing is in keeping with a spate of battleground-state polls that found an erosion of Mr. Trump's support. Those included surveys released Wednesday and Thursday showing Mrs. Clinton with double-digit leads in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire and ahead by 9 points in Michigan.
Republicans have been hoping to make those states competitive on the strength of Mr. Trump's support among working-class, white voters. But those surveys and the new Journal/NBC News poll indicate that while Mr. Trump has solidified support among that group, he has been losing support among college-educated and suburban voters, whom he also needs to win the general election.
The Journal/NBC News poll found Mrs. Clinton winning among white voters with four-year college degrees by 7 percentage points, 47% to 40%. Mitt Romney, the GOP's nominee in 2012, had won that group by 14 points. Before the conventions, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump were essentially tied among those voters, separated by only 1 percentage point.
Similar patterns appeared in the new battleground-state surveys. A Franklin & Marshall poll of Pennsylvania voters, which showed Mrs. Clinton with an 11-point overall lead in the state, found a lopsided, 40-point lead for the Democrat in Southeastern Pennsylvania, including the Philadelphia suburbs, where residents tend to have relatively high incomes and educational attainment.
Former Sen. Trent Lott (R., Miss.) is among the many Trump supporters who think Mr. Trump needs to change his tone and stop attacking other Republicans to avoid alienating more voters.
""The rhetoric has to change, and it has to change soon if he's going to stop the erosion and bring people back who are looking for a way to be for him,"" said Mr. Lott.
There are signs that Mr. Trump is trying to retrain his focus after days in which Republicans inside and outside the campaign implored him to unleash his ire on the Democratic nominee, not Messrs. Khan or Ryan.
At the Portland rally, he stayed largely on message and focused on Mrs. Clinton. He spoke at length about a Wall Street Journal report this week that the U.S. had secretly transferred $400 million in cash to Iran just as the country released four detained Americans.
Calling the move ""just sickening,"" Mr. Trump said that electing Mrs. Clinton would be akin to ""four more years of Obama.""
The Clinton campaign's press secretary responded on Twitter, saying she had nothing to do with the payment, which occurred several years after she left office.
To get others on the same page, the Trump campaign is this week circulating a memo to supporters urging them tofocus on ""Clinton's blatant dishonesty to the American public."" That is a shift from talking points circulated earlier this week on Capitol Hill, which centered on the dust-up with Mr. Khan and his wife and the ""crooked"" presidential debate schedule.
Susie Wiles, who is helping run Mr. Trump's campaign in Florida, pointed to the large and high-spirited crowds that greeted him in Florida on Wednesday. ""I think the ship, which has been listing ever so slightly, seems to be righted,"" Ms. Wiles said.
Allies of Mr. Trump have promised on prior occasions that he would be more ""presidential,"" only to see the candidate stir up another controversy.
Penny Nance, chief executive of Concerned Women for America, a group that opposes abortion rights and favors traditional marriage, said she was hoping Mr. Trump would learn from his mistakes. But she cautioned, ""I have learned to be really skeptical, because every time I think he's done, he's not.""
In a two-way race, Mrs. Clinton now leads among male voters 43% to 42%. She leads among women 51%-35%.
The poll also found that Mrs. Clinton retained a 9-point lead when third-party candidates are included on the ballot. In a four-way match up, the poll found Mrs. Clinton drew 43%, while Mr. Trump had 34%, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson had 10% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein drew 5%.
The poll found that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump continued to be viewed more negatively than positively by voters. But it found a small improvement in Mrs. Clinton's image: 37% viewed her positively, while 53% viewed her negatively. Last month, the split was 34% positive, 56% negative.
Feelings about Mr. Trump remained almost unchanged from the prior month, with 28% viewing him positively and 61% viewing him negatively.
The survey was conducted July 31 to Aug. 3. Its margin of error was plus or minus 3.46 percentage points.

Election 2016: Clinton Camp Woos Republicans --- Campaign ramps up effort in wake of recent missteps by rival Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809029191?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, hoping to take advantage of growing public unease with rival Donald Trump, is recruiting prominent Republicans in a bid to make GOP voters comfortable casting ballots for the Democratic nominee this November.
The effort, which largely targets national-security experts and business leaders, began several months ago but has ramped up in the wake of Mr. Trump's recent troubles, including his spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain who died in Iraq, people familiar with the effort said.
It is expected to culminate in a Republicans for Hillary group, whose members will endorse her candidacy.
Matt Higgins, a businessman and a longtime Republican, said he reached out to the Clinton campaign after Mr. Trump secured the nomination, and was invited to its Brooklyn, N.Y., headquarters to meet with officials. They won him over, he said, and he has donated the maximum contribution to her campaign. He is also speaking publicly on her behalf.
""They were very coordinated, very responsive, and very sensitive,"" Mr. Higgins said.
If the effort pays off, campaign officials hope it will boost Mrs. Clinton's support among Republicans, particularly suburban women, and reinforce anxieties about a Trump presidency.
A representative for Mr. Trump didn't reply to a request for comment on the outreach by the Clinton campaign.
Mr. Trump has predicted he will win over supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost the Democratic nomination to Mrs. Clinton.
""Bernie Sanders people are going to be voting for Trump,"" he said in Florida this week. ""They like Trump.""
There is no evidence his campaign has an organized effort to lure those voters, and many Sanders backers who don't like Mrs. Clinton say they are considering the Green Party candidate.
The Clinton recruitment drive is being led by campaign chairman John Podesta and by Leslie Dach, a former Wal-Mart executive who worked in the Bill Clinton and Obama administrations. They have reached out to potential recruits directly and worked through emissaries. Mrs. Clinton has personally made phone calls, including one to Meg Whitman, the Republican CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and onetime candidate for California governor, who this week endorsed her.
More than 45 Republicans, including politicians, strategists, policy experts and business executives are backing Mrs. Clinton, according to public statements.
One recent recruit is Frank Lavin, who worked in the Reagan and both Bush administrations and said he has strategized with Mr. Dach about speaking publicly on Mrs. Clinton's behalf, possibly in his home state of Ohio, a battleground. He said in an interview he had decided long ago not to back Mr. Trump, but reached out to the Clinton campaign after the Democratic convention, which left him more comfortable supporting her.
""I have an increasing comfort level with Hillary Clinton and ongoing concern about Trump,"" he said. He added that Mrs. Clinton's choice of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, seen as a centrist, as her running mate gave him particular reassurance.
""She's not going to be bossed around by the Bernie Sanders wing of her party,"" he said.
That points to a potential pitfall: any effort to recruit conservatives' risks alienating liberal Democrats. To avoid that, the campaign is emphasizing Mrs. Clinton's qualifications, temperament and fitness for office when seeking GOP support, not her policy positions.
Laurie Cestnick of Boston, part of the ""Bernie or bust"" movement, said she expects most hard-core Sanders supporters will vote for the Green Party's Jill Stein, although she has seen some efforts by Trump backers to win them over.
""They're disappointed and they're going Green because they don't know what else to do,"" she said.
The Clinton campaign has telegraphed its interest in recruiting Republicans. The Democratic National Convention featured former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent, and two Republicans, former Reagan administration official Doug Elmets and a co-founder of a pro-Clinton GOP women's group, Jennifer Lim.
In her speech last week, Mrs. Clinton said she would be ""president for Democrats, Republicans and independents."" After the convention, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kaine and their spouses went on a bus tour through Republican parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio.Priorities USA Action, the primary Clinton super PAC, released a new TV spot featuring high-profile Republicans slamming Mr. Trump.
""I thought both the convention as a whole and the president's speech at the convention was an outreach to Republicans to say, 'It's OK, you can cross over this time and the world isn't going to come to an end,'"" said former New Jersey Gov. Christie Todd Whitman, a Republican. She said she has been approached by Clinton emissaries but while she won't vote for Mr. Trump, she remains undecided between Mrs. Clinton and the libertarian ticket.

FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Clinton Probe; Laptop may contain thousands of messages sent to or from Mrs. Clinton's private server,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1833786422?accountid=12768,"The surprise disclosure that agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are taking a new look at Hillary Clinton's email use lays bare, just days before the election, tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee.
Investigators found 650,000 emails on a laptop that they believe was used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide , and underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter.
It will take weeks, at a minimum, to determine whether those messages are work-related from the time Ms. Abedin served with Mrs. Clinton at the State Department; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the FBI; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe.
Officials had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails--which they received over the weekend, according to a person familiar with the matter--because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of Mr. Weiner.
The new investigative effort, disclosed by FBI Director James Comey on Friday, shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign. Even as the probe of Mrs. Clinton's email use wound down in July, internal disagreements within the bureau and the Justice Department surrounding the Clintons' family philanthropy heated up, according to people familiar with the matter.
The latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau's second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor , they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.
Those emails stretched back years, these people said, and were on a laptop that hadn't previously come up in the Clinton email probe. Ms. Abedin said in late August that the couple were separating.
The FBI had searched the computer while looking for child pornography, people familiar with the matter said, but the warrant they used didn't give them authority to search for matters related to Mrs. Clinton's email arrangement at the State Department. Mr. Weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the minor.
In their initial review of the laptop, the metadata showed many messages, apparently in the thousands, that were either sent to or from the private email server at Mrs. Clinton's home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the FBI. Senior FBI officials decided to let the Weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer, and report back to them.
At a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and FBI officials, a member of the department's senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said.
Mr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptop's contents could be relevant to the Clinton email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant.
Mr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned the FBI that telling Congress would violate policies against overt actions that could affect an election, and some within the FBI have been unhappy at Mr. Comey's repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his press conference on the subject in July.
The back-and-forth reflects how the bureau is probing several matters related, directly or indirectly, to Mrs. Clinton and her inner circle.
New details show that senior law-enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in a bureau investigation of the Clinton Foundation, sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross-country effort, and, according to some people familiar with the matter, told agents to limit their pursuit of the case. The probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity.
Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case.
It isn't unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. McCabe's wife, Jill McCabe, received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political-action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons and, until he was elected governor in November 2013, a Clinton Foundation board member.
Mr. McAuliffe had supported Dr. McCabe in the hopes she and a handful of other Democrats might help win a majority in the state Senate. Dr. McCabe lost her race last November, and Democrats failed to win their majority.
A spokesman for the governor has said that ""any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous.""
Dr. McCabe told the Journal, ""Once I decided to run, my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be"" supportive.
In February of this year, Mr. McCabe ascended from the No. 3 position at the FBI to the deputy director post. When he assumed that role, officials say, he started overseeing the probe into Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server for government work when she was secretary of state.
FBI officials have said Mr. McCabe had no role in the Clinton email probe until he became deputy director, and by then his wife's campaign was over.
But other Clinton-related investigations were under way within the FBI, and they have been the subject of internal debate for months, according to people familiar with the matter.
Early this year, four FBI field offices--New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Ark.--were collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling, according to people familiar with the matter.
Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the Clinton Foundation from an unrelated public-corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation, these people said.
The Washington field office was probing financial relationships involving Mr. McAuliffe before he became a Clinton Foundation board member, these people said. Mr. McAuliffe has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity.
Clinton Foundation officials have long denied any wrongdoing, saying it is a well-run charity that has done immense good.
The FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said.
In February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn't go well.
Some said that is because the FBI didn't present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career anticorruption prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn't a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case.
""That was one of the weirdest meetings I've ever been to,"" one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter.
Anticorruption prosecutors at the Justice Department told the FBI at the meeting they wouldn't authorize more aggressive investigative techniques, such as subpoenas, formal witness interviews, or grand-jury activity. But the FBI officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way, these people said.
About a week after Mr. Comey's July announcement that he was recommending against any prosecution in the Clinton email case, the FBI sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe, with Mr. McCabe deciding the FBI's New York office would take the lead, with assistance from Little Rock.
The Washington field office, FBI officials decided, would focus on a separate matter involving Mr. McAuliffe. Mr. McCabe had decided earlier in the spring that he would continue to recuse himself from that probe, given the governor's contributions to his wife's former political campaign.
Within the FBI, the decision was viewed with skepticism by some, who felt the probe would be stronger if the foundation and McAuliffe matters were combined. Others, particularly Justice Department anticorruption prosecutors, felt that both probes were weak, based largely on publicly available information, and had found little that would merit expanded investigative authority.
According to a person familiar with the probes, on Aug. 12, a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Clinton Foundation probe during the election season. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn't use overt methods requiring Justice Department approvals.
The Justice Department official was ""very pissed off,"" according to one person close to Mr. McCabe, and pressed him to explain why the FBI was still chasing a matter the department considered dormant. Others said the Justice Department was simply trying to make sure FBI agents were following longstanding policy not to make overt investigative moves that could be seen as trying to influence an election. Those rules discourage investigators from making any such moves before a primary or general election, and, at a minimum, checking with anticorruption prosecutors before doing so.
""Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?"" Mr. McCabe asked, according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause, the official replied, ""Of course not,"" these people said.
For Mr. McCabe's defenders, the exchange showed how he was stuck between an FBI office eager to pour more resources into a case and Justice Department prosecutors who didn't think much of the case, one person said. Those people said that following the call, Mr. McCabe reiterated past instructions to FBI agents that they were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had.
Others further down the FBI chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: ""Stand down."" When agents questioned why they weren't allowed to take more aggressive steps, they said they were told the order had come from the deputy director--Mr. McCabe.
Others familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior FBI official gave such a stand-down instruction.
For agents who already felt uneasy about FBI leadership's handling of the Clinton Foundation case, the moment only deepened their concerns, these people said. For those who felt the probe hadn't yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct, the leadership's approach was the right response.
In September, agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the Clinton email case, but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the FBI based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements, meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information.
Some FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they couldn't ""go prosecutor-shopping.""
Not long after that discussion, FBI agents informed the bureau's leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey's disclosure to Congress and setting off the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign.

Gold Pops Higher on News of Clinton Investigation; The precious metal is a popular safe haven during political or economic turbulence,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1833133801?accountid=12768,"Gold prices extended gains Friday, driven by fresh political uncertainty in the U.S.
Gold for December delivery closed up 0.6% at $1,282.10 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices rallied further in aftermarket trading and were recently up 1%.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it has uncovered new evidence in its investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's email server and is reviewing evidence in connection with a probe that had been previously closed. The news boosted prices for the precious metal, a popular safe haven during political or economic turbulence.
""Something like this, right before the election, definitely creates lots of uncertainty,"" said Bob Haberkorn, a broker at RJO Futures. ""This was the fresh news that gold needed.""
Gold prices reversed losses earlier in the session after a report showing the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in two years during the third quarter.
On one hand, the stronger-than-expected numbers bolstered the argument for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in coming months. Gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments such as Treasurys when rates rise.
At the same time, however, some market participants believe stronger growth may be a harbinger of rising consumer prices. Some investors buy gold on expectations that inflation will accelerate, as they believe the metal holds its value better than other assets.
""Investors have got inflation and the election on their minds,"" said Ira Epstein, a strategist at the Linn Group.
While expectations of a rate increase in December will likely limit gains, ""gold doesn't look like it has much downside from here,"" he said.
Federal-funds futures, used to bet on central-bank policy, on Friday showed that investors assigned a 73.6% likelihood of a rate increase in December, up from around 50% in the middle of last month.

Oil Prices Sag on Concerns About OPEC Deal on Output Cut; New chapter in FBI probe of Hillary Clinton email server unsettles market,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1833060446?accountid=12768,"Oil prices fell amid fresh worries about OPEC's ability to coordinate a production cut, and a broader selloff Friday afternoon on the prospect of a new chapter in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's email server.
The FBI has uncovered and is reviewing new evidence in the previously closed investigation. The news rattled markets and sent stocks, currencies and commodities lower.
""Oil prices just got washed out with the tide of generalized selling,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital. ""It's unsettling for the markets.""
Meanwhile, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an impasse during technical talks in Vienna aimed at preparing a more detailed plan to cut production, The Wall Street Journal reported. Iran and Iraq have refused to curb their output and disputed the OPEC's data on production levels, officials said.
""The market senses no progress, whereas before they gave it some probability that OPEC may come to an agreement,"" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.
U.S. crude for December delivery fell $1.02, or 2.05%, to $48.70 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 76 cents, or 1.51% to $49.71 a barrel on London's ICE Futures exchange.
OPEC's tentative deal to cut production has buoyed prices since September. But the rally has flagged over uncertainty about the execution of the plan. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, ended the week down 4.23%.
OPEC is expected to make a formal announcement on Nov. 30 on the fate of the deal.
Recently Iraq has been lobbying to get an exemption from the deal because of disruptions from the Islamic State insurgency.
OPEC members Iran, Nigeria and Libya have already secured exemptions from the agreement because they have faced petroleum-output disruptions.
The consequences if OPEC fails to agree are substantial, so some analysts are anticipating a basic deal.
It could be a ""watered down"" version, compared with the original proposal of curbing the group's production by 200,000 to 700,000 barrels a day, said BMI Research.
For example, all parties could end up agreeing to freeze their production at their peak output level instead of scaling back, with the exceptions of Libya, Nigeria, and Iran, who could be allowed to ramp up until they reach their normal production levels.
""If they will fail to deliver in November, the market will sell off very hard and I think they know that,"" said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects. ""They can't keep kicking the can down the line.""
Gasoline futures fell 1.8 cents, or 1.21%, to $1.4691 a gallon. Diesel futures fell 2.79 cents, or $1.78%, to $1.5422 a gallon.

U.S. Stocks Drop; Treasurys Stabilize; Decline by stocks follows news FBI is reviewing new evidence in Clinton email case,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1833021988?accountid=12768,"U.S. stocks fell Friday, ending a week dominated by quarterly earnings reports.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell this past week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a slight gain. The losses coincided with a selloff in government bonds that pushed yields to their highest levels in five months.
The Dow industrials fell 8.49 points, or less than 0.1%, to 18161.19 on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 25.87 points, or 0.5%, to 5190.10.
Government bonds stabilized after two days of sharp price declines. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged higher Friday to 1.847%--its highest yield since May 27.
Stocks pulled back from earlier gains after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was reviewing new evidence in connection with its investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's email server.
Some of the initial selling was likely triggered by algorithmic trading platforms that analyze news headlines for certain words or phrases, mark them as negative or positive, and buy and sell stocks or bonds accordingly, some traders said.
The S&P 500 was up 0.2% shortly before the news, then quickly reversed those gains and ended down 6.63 points, or 0.3%, at 2126.41.
Gold for November delivery rose 0.6% to $1,275.50 an ounce.
Investors and traders have said the market is susceptible to shifts in expectations about who will win the U.S. presidential election.
""The next week before the election will keep the market on edge,"" said Kenny Polcari, director of equities at O'Neil Securities, adding that he expects more surprises that could swing stocks.
Earlier Friday, stocks were rising after the Commerce Department said gross domestic product expanded at an inflation- and seasonally adjusted 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter, exceeding the second quarter's pace of 1.4%.
But disappointing quarterly results from some U.S. companies pressured shares, capping a busy week of earnings . More than half of S&P 500 companies have reported so far.
McKesson shares tumbled $36.39, or 23%, to $124.11 after the health-care giant on Thursday cut its profit outlook for the year. It was the lowest close for the stock since 2013, and its biggest one-day percentage decline since 1999.
Amgen fell 15.39, or 9.6%, to 145.18 as the drugmaker on Thursday reported a drop in sales of its cancer-care drug Neupogen, which started facing competition late last year.
Health-care stocks were the worst performers in the S&P 500, falling 2.2%.
The shares of Amazon.com dropped 42.04, or 5.1%, to 776.32 after the online retail giant late Thursday posted its lowest quarterly profit in a year . It was the stock's biggest one-day percentage decline since February.
Despite Friday's declines, the earnings season is shaping up to be better than analysts' downbeat expectations.
""Overall, the mini earnings recession is coming to an end,"" said Chris Jeffery, an asset-allocation strategist at Legal & General Investment Management. ""That's largely about the energy and materials sectors coming out of their slump,"" he added.
In Europe, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, lowered its revenue forecast , sending its shares down 4.3%. The Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.3%, losing 1% for the week.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.6% Friday and 1.5% for the week.

Election 2016: Clinton Makes Bet on Infrastructure,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809141448?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS -- Hillary Clinton has made upgrading the nation's roads, bridges, energy grid and water systems a central part of her pitch to voters, aiming to forge a sweeping agreement if she becomes president in one the few areas where the two parties might be willing to collaborate.
Mrs. Clinton's prospects for making good on her infrastructure promises would depend on the details, though, and the Democratic nominee has yet to fill in some blanks of her five-year, $275 billion program. Disagreements over how to fund infrastructure have derailed recent efforts in Congress.
Calling the need to update infrastructure ""a national emergency,"" Mrs. Clinton has laid out a blueprint for investing intraditional public-works projects, as well as modernizing the nation's airspace system and ensuring that every household has access to high-speed broadband internet.
""We are going to have an investment in infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports,"" Mrs. Clinton said Thursday in Las Vegas. ""But it's not only what you can see. It's also under the ground -- the water systems, the sewer systems and, yes, we need a new modern electric grid.""
Lawmakers from both parties have consistently said they hope to improve infrastructure; even some conservative House Republicans in December backed a five-year, $305 billion highway bill after stringing together short-term patches since 2008.
But Congress has more often struggled to figure out how to pay for massive improvements.
For lawmakers, ""This is like candy. This is 'let's eat the frosting before we look at the broccoli,' "" said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. ""Everybody sort of agrees in principle that we need to spend more money on infrastructure, but it's the details that could be difficult.""
One reason things could be changing is that House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the expected Democratic Senate leader next year, have worked together in the past on how to overhaul the international tax system to provide funding for a burst of infrastructure spending. GOP nominee Donald Trump is also calling for such a package.
Still, the next president will have to overcome recent history. President Barack Obama has lamented that his $478 billion infrastructure proposal didn't get through Congress because roads and bridges somehow had become a partisan issue. Republicans said Mr. Obama's grandest plans for infrastructure had no traction because they were often coupled with tax measures they didn't support.
Mrs. Clinton has said she would pay for her infrastructure plan with ""business tax reform,"" but she has offered few details.
Mr. Obama wants a one-time, 14% tax on companies' stockpiled foreign profits as part of a transition to a new system for taxing U.S. companies' overseas income. Lawmakers didn't use that plan to pay for the recent highway construction bill, and the idea hasn't advanced far, despite conceptual support from top legislators.
For her part, Mrs. Clinton hasn't said whether she would support lowering the corporate tax rate, often a key piece of tax overhaul proposals.
A Clinton campaign official said details about her infrastructure proposal would be announced in the next few weeks, and that a business-tax overhaul is still to come.
Lawmakers said the beginning of a new administration and a new session of Congress is the time to strike. ""The new president always starts out with political capital they don't have at the end of their term,"" said Rep. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.), an early congressional supporter of Mr. Trump's.
Clinton campaign officials said she would push Congress to act during the first 100 days of her administration.
Mr. Trump recently pledged to ""spendat least double"" what Mrs. Clinton is proposing to invest, telling Fox Business Network that his plan would be financed with debt.

Election 2016: New Try to Tame Email Flap --- Sen. Kaine says Clinton explained and apologized 'over and over again' on issue,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809581469?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- As Hillary Clinton struggles to put the contretemps over her personal email server behind her, her running mate is offering a more simple defense: the Democratic presidential contender messed up, said she was sorry and won't do it again.
""The bottom line is this: She made a mistake and she said over and over again, 'I made a mistake and I've learned from it. I'm going to fix it, and I apologize for it,' "" Tim Kaine said Sundayon NBC.
If elected, a Clinton administration would be ""real transparent,"" added Mr. Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia.
Mrs. Clinton could use Mr. Kaine's help in trying to get past the email issue. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last week showed Mrs. Clinton with a nine-point lead over GOP nominee Donald Trump, 47% to 38%. But the survey also showed the email issue as one of the Democrat's chief vulnerabilities.
Some 48% of registered voters had ""major concerns"" about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. Some 17% had ""moderate concerns,"" while 35% had minor or no concerns. That was about the same proportion as the 49% who said they had ""major concerns"" with Mr. Trump's tussles with parents of a slain Muslim soldier who spoke at the Democratic convention.
Meantime, 46% of those polled rated Mrs. Clinton ""very poor"" when asked about her honesty and straightforwardness. Mr. Trump was rated ""very poor"" by 36%.
The email flap resurfaced recently after fact checkers and critics disputed Mrs. Clinton's claim that Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey had characterized her answers on the issue, both in public and private, as ""truthful.""
Mr. Comey has said she didn't lie to FBI investigators, but he declined to characterize her public comments.
Mrs. Clinton missed a chance to calm the controversy Friday when, challenged about her assertion at a reporters' convention, she muddied the answer.
""What I told the FBI -- which he said was truthful -- is consistent with what I have said publicly,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""I may have short-circuited, and for that, I will try to clarify.""
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus responded by saying Mrs. Clinton is ""incapable of telling the truth to the nation."" Mr. Trump and his allies have picked up the phrase ""short-circuited"" to raise questions about her ability to handle the presidency.
Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, an outspoken Trump skeptic in the Republican Party, saidSundaythat the email strategy laid out by Mr. Kaine would probably serve Mrs. Clinton better than the approach she has taken so far.
""Hillary Clinton would be better to apologize for her statement regarding the emails and move on,"" he said on CBS.
Asked about the latest twist in the email issue, Mr. Kaine avoided the details. ""I have heard Hillary Clinton say over and over again when I've been sitting next to her and when I've watched her on TV that with respect to the emails, 'I made a mistake and I've learned something -- I wouldn't do it again,'"" he told NBC.
Polling last week also showed that Mr. Kaine has work to do in introducing himself to voters. The Journal/NBC News poll found 26% of registered voters have ""very positive"" or ""somewhat positive"" feelings about the senator, while 19% reported ""very negative"" or ""somewhat negative"" impressions.
The bulk, however, didn't express strong opinions at all: 31% were neutral, while 25% didn't know his name or weren't sure how they felt. And 78% of those polled said Mrs. Clinton's decision to put Mr. Kaine on her ticket wouldn't affect their choice for president. Similarly, 74% said Mr. Trump's choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence wouldn't affect their votes.

Information Age: Clinton Short-Circuits the Truth,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809566698?accountid=12768,"About two-thirds of voters say Hillary Clinton isn't ""honest or trustworthy,"" which in most elections would be decisive. With so much media focus on Donald Trump, it's worth parsing Mrs. Clinton's most recent efforts to persuade voters of her honesty.
Late last month, Fox News's Chris Wallace played clips of Mrs. Clinton's statements over the past year about her unsecure home email server. Then he said to her: ""After a long investigation, FBI Director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true.""
Mrs. Clinton's reply: ""Director Comey said that my answers were truthful.""
Not even close. Mrs. Clinton denied sending or receiving classified email, but Mr. Comey told Congress: ""There was classified material emailed."" Mrs. Clinton claimed there was ""nothing marked classified""; Mr. Comey testified: ""That's not true."" He cited more than 100 classified emails, 36 of them top secret. ""There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,"" Mr. Comey said.
To her pledge that she had turned over all her work-related email, Mr. Comey testified: ""No, we found work-related emails, thousands, that were not returned."" When asked, ""Did she lie to the American public?"" the lawyerly Mr. Comey testified: ""That's a question I'm not qualified to answer.""
The Washington Post awarded Mrs. Clinton four Pinocchios for her falsehood in the Wallace interview. But the New York Times didn't even cover the story until its public editor, Liz Spayd, wrote a blog post Tuesday titled ""The Clinton Story You Didn't Read Here."" Ms. Spayd observed: ""If you're getting all your political news from the New York Times, this may be the first time you're hearing this.""
On Friday Mrs. Clinton had a chance to revise her comments when a reporter asked her: ""Are you mischaracterizing Director Comey's testimony and is this not undercutting your efforts to rebuild trust with the American people?""
Her reply: ""Director Comey had said that my answers in my FBI interview were truthful. That's really the bottom line here and I have said during the interview and in many other occasions over the past few months, that what I told the FBI, which he said was truthful, is consistent with what I have said publicly. So I may have short-circuited and for that, I, you know, will try to clarify.""
A writer for the left-of-center website Slate called Mrs. Clinton's comments a ""master class in obfuscation"" and ""an awkward journey of dissembling and lawyerly quibbling."" A spokesman for Mr. Trump called it a ""painful, pretzel-like response.""
Mrs. Clinton's short-circuiting of the truth on Friday also included a repetition of her false claim that ""I never sent or received anything that was marked classified."" Mr. Comey testified that she did, and added that in any case ""participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.""
Clintonian obfuscation won't hide the reason she set up her private email server in her basement. She publicly claimed it was for ""convenience,"" so that she could use a single device for her work and personal emails, but Mr. Comey confirmed she used multiple devices. Mrs. Clinton disclosed the real reason in a 2010 email that came to light later. ""I don't want any risk of the personal being accessible,"" she wrote her State Department advisers. She chose to evade the requirement that her work emails be on State's servers because that would have made them accessible to the public under disclosure laws.
The result is that her emails are available -- just not to Americans. Contrary to Mrs. Clinton's claim that ""there were no security breaches,"" security experts agree China, Russia and unknown others hacked into all 63,000 emails on the home-brew server -- including the 33,000 she failed to provide under court order.
The timeline suggests after Russia hacked Mrs. Clinton's emails, its spies decided to complete their knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's relationships by hacking the Clinton Foundation, State Department and Democratic National Committee. Unless a friendly spy agency that hacked Mrs. Clinton's emails does Americans a favor by publishing them before the election, if she is elected Vladimir Putin will have the capacity to blackmail her at will.
In this election year, voters may not have the option of getting everything they want in a candidate. For all Mr. Trump's gaffes, at least none directly threaten national security. But voters are now on notice that Mrs. Clinton's ""short-circuited"" truth is far from the truth.

Clinton's Republican Strategy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809566578?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is actively courting Republican voters, which isn't surprising given how unhappy millions of conservatives are with Donald Trump. But what's equally striking is that the Democrat is making no movement to the middle on policy to win over Republicans -- even now that she has won her party's nomination.
Usually at this stage of a presidential race, the major-party nominees would have consolidated their core supporters and would be reaching out to attract undecided voters. The polls show Democrats are coalescing behind Mrs. Clinton since the election, including Bernie Sanders voters. Yet her appeal to the middle so far has been limited to trying to disqualify Mr. Trump on temperament and national security. She's not budging at all on policy.
This is highly unusual in presidential elections, or at least it was until the Obama era. Richard Nixon moved to the middle on economic policy to attract Democrats upset by the New Left in 1968 and 1972; Bill Clinton campaigned on welfare reform, reducing the budget deficit and getting tough on crime in 1992; and George W. Bush touted his education reform and Medicare drug benefit in 2000.
Mrs. Clinton is doing nothing of the kind, even after her sharp left turn in the primaries to neutralize Mr. Sanders. Her economic plan is further to the left of President Obama's on trade (opposition to the Pacific deal), taxes (higher), regulation (more), health care (price controls), spending (more) and energy (hostility to fracking for natural gas).
Even when she's been given an opening to move to the middle, her campaign has disavowed it. Her longtime pal and fund-raiser, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, said during the Democratic convention that Mrs. Clinton would turn and support the Pacific trade pact after she is elected. Her campaign chief replied on Twitter: ""Love Gov. McAuliffe, but he got this one flat wrong. Hillary opposes TPP BEFORE and AFTER the election. Period. Full stop.""
That's staying left to keep Sanders voters, not moving right to appeal to the college-educated, free-market Republicans who tell pollsters they dislike Mr. Trump.
Perhaps Mrs. Clinton and her strategists figure they don't need to move on policy to win the election. Mr. Trump has been playing into the Democratic strategy of disqualifying him on temperament grounds. Her ads have driven home that theme, quoting prominent conservatives like former CIA Director Mike Hayden criticizing Mr. Trump's statements on national security. She may not be trying to win over GOP voters so much as demoralize them so they stay home on Election Day.
This Clinton electoral strategy nonetheless matters as a signal of how Mrs. Clinton would govern. Some Republicans console themselves about Mr. Trump by saying that Mrs. Clinton will be more willing to negotiate with Republicans than Mr. Obama has been. She'll be a deal-maker like her husband, they believe.
Perhaps, but political compromise requires at least some policy common ground. Bill Clinton was willing to cut the capital-gains tax rate in 1997 to 20% in return for the children's health-care program. But Bill hadn't run in 1996 on raising taxes and he even told voters he regretted his 1993 tax increase. Hillary Clinton is campaigning on raising the capital-gains rate to Jimmy Carter-era rates.
One possible compromise in 2017 would be corporate tax reform to pay for spending on public works. Republicans would get a lower corporate tax rate that would help the economy, and more revenue from repatriating some of the $2 trillion in U.S. capital held overseas. Democrats would get more money to spend on roads and bridges.
House Speaker Paul Ryan has been pursuing precisely such a deal for months, only to run up against ideological opposition from the Obama Treasury. Mr. Obama won't let the 35% corporate rate fall enough to make a difference. Mrs. Clinton hasn't given any indication she'd break from the Obama position.
It also isn't clear how much Senate Democrats would let her compromise. The Senate's Elizabeth Warren faction is feeling empowered after Bernie Sanders's showing in the primaries, and they might not let her cut tax rates or tolerate more health-care flexibility if they retake the Senate and Republicans keep the House.
New Presidents tend to do what they promise. Mrs. Clinton's refusal to make even a policy gesture to the middle suggests she thinks Mr. Trump gives Democrats an opening to retake Congress and revive the progressive glory days of 2009-2010. That's a warning for Republicans not to stay home on Election Day even if they can't vote for Mr. Trump.",2016-11-01
"Election 2016: Economy Buffets Clinton, Trump Claims -- Mixed reports could undercut arguments by each candidate on state of the rebound",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807848511?accountid=12768,"The U.S. economy is flashing mixed signals heading toward November's election, complicating the narrative for both presidential campaigns in a race featuring sharply different views of the vitality of the seven-year expansion.
Presidential elections often hinge on popular perceptions of the economy's health, particularly those that solidify in the early summer of an election year. That puts a premium on economic gauges in June and July, be it on overall output, the pace of hiring or measures of consumer sentiment.
New figures out Friday showed U.S. gross domestic product, a broad measure of output, averaged a paltry 1% seasonally adjusted annual growth rate through the year's first half, well below historical norms. That has raised fears the economy is slowing heading into the election.
That would add a new headwind for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as she tries to fend off Republican contender Donald Trump, since her campaign in part is based on praising the success fellow Democrat President Barack Obama has had in rejuvenating the economy since 2009. Research shows voters can take a dimmer view of incumbent parties when the economy is underperforming.
At the same time, other important measures, on jobs, wages, consumer spending and consumer confidence, suggest a degree of resilience for the seven-year expansion, undercutting Mr. Trump's portrayal of an economy in dismal shape.
Economic ups and downs almost always play into presidential campaigns, as they did in 2012, when steady hiring aided Mr. Obama.
In the past three elections comparable to this one, in which a two-term president was stepping down -- 1988, 2000 and 2008 -- the state of the economy played a key role, but in unpredictable ways.
In 1988, George H.W. Bush won his first term, and the Republican Party's third consecutive term, in the White House. The economy, in the fifth year of a robust expansion, certainly helped. GDP, for example, advanced at a 3.9% pace during that year's first half, faster than the post-World War II average of about 3.2%. The labor market also was expanding at a solid clip.
By mid-1988, consumer spending had climbed 8% from a year earlier. (Currently it is up less than 4%.) The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed confidence on the rise.
In 2000, a vibrant economy failed to propel Al Gore into the White House, which would have been a third straight term for Democrats.
At the midpoint of 2000, GDP was averaging a 4.5% growth rate, the labor market had added close to three million jobs over the previous year, consumer spending was up 7.7% and consumer sentiment was coming off a record high.
Republican George W. Bush won the contested election by a whisker after a Supreme Court case over Florida vote counting was decided in his favor.
In mid-2008, the housing market was collapsing, Lehman Brothers was on the brink of bankruptcy and the economy was months into a deep recession. GDP contracted and the labor market shed jobs. While consumers continued to spend, confidence was in free fall. Mr. Obama defeated Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who was seeking to succeed his fellow Republican, Mr. Bush.
How does the economy look now? The biggest mark against it is found in the broadest measure of growth. The meager first half GDP growth rate resulted in part because of a pullback in investment by companies, a drawdown in business inventories and slower government spending.
The labor market has been performing well, though not as well as the 1988 and 2000 cycles. Nonfarm payrolls are up by about 2.5 million over the past year, while the unemployment rate in June was 4.9%, compared with 5.4% in 1988, 4% in 2000 and 5.6% in 2008.
Consumers are offering a key support for the economy, with their spending up 3.7% from a year earlier. Consumer confidence is roughly in line with 1988 but well short of 2000 levels.
""The economy in terms of the growth rate of GDP is clearly not a plus for the Democrats in 2016,"" said Ray Fair, a Yale University professor who has written extensively on the economy's impact on elections. Tepid output combined with the electorate's tendency to vote out a two-term incumbent party work against Mrs. Clinton, he said.
Still, Mr. Fair said, 2016 is an unusual election and Mr. Trump an atypical candidate for the Republican Party.

"The Clinton Foundation, State and Kremlin Connections",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807838680?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton touts her tenure as secretary of state as a time of hardheaded realism and ""commercial diplomacy"" that advanced American national and commercial interests. But her handling of a major technology transfer initiative at the heart of Washington's effort to ""reset"" relations with Russia raises serious questions about her record. Far from enhancing American national interests, Mrs. Clinton's efforts in this area may have substantially undermined U.S. national security.
Consider Skolkovo, an ""innovation city"" of 30,000 people on the outskirts of Moscow, billed as Russia's version of Silicon Valley -- and a core piece of Mrs. Clinton's quarterbacking of the Russian reset.
Following his 2009 visit to Moscow, President Obama announced the creation of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission. Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state directed the American side, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov represented the Russians. The stated goal at the time: ""identifying areas of cooperation and pursuing joint projects and actions that strengthen strategic stability, international security, economic well-being, and the development of ties between the Russian and American people.""
The Kremlin committed $5 billion over three years to fund Skolkovo. Mrs. Clinton's State Department worked aggressively to attract U.S. investment partners and helped the Russian State Investment Fund, Rusnano, identify American tech companies worthy of Russian investment. Rusnano, which a scientific adviser to President Vladimir Putin called ""Putin's child,"" was created in 2007 and relies entirely on Russian state funding.
What could possibly go wrong?
Soon, dozens of U.S. tech firms, including top Clinton Foundation donors like Google, Intel and Cisco, made major financial contributions to Skolkovo, with Cisco committing a cool $1 billion. In May 2010, the State Department facilitated a Moscow visit by 22 of the biggest names in U.S. venture capital -- and weeks later the first memorandums of understanding were signed by Skolkovo and American companies.
By 2012 the vice president of the Skolkovo Foundation, Conor Lenihan -- who had previously partnered with the Clinton Foundation -- recorded that Skolkovo had assembled 28 Russian, American and European ""Key Partners."" Of the 28 ""partners,"" 17, or 60%, have made financial commitments to the Clinton Foundation, totaling tens of millions of dollars, or sponsored speeches by Bill Clinton.
Russians tied to Skolkovo also flowed funds to the Clinton Foundation. Andrey Vavilov, the chairman of SuperOx, which is part of Skolkovo's nuclear-research cluster, donated between $10,000 and $25,000 (donations are reported in ranges, not exact amounts) to the Clinton's family charity. Skolkovo Foundation chief and billionaire Putin confidant Viktor Vekselberg also gave to the Clinton Foundation through his company, Renova Group.
Amid all the sloshing of Russia rubles and American dollars, however, the state-of-the-art technological research coming out of Skolkovo raised alarms among U.S. military experts and federal law-enforcement officials. Research conducted in 2012 on Skolkovo by the U.S. Army Foreign Military Studies Program at Fort Leavenworth declared that the purpose of Skolkovo was to serve as a ""vehicle for world-wide technology transfer to Russia in the areas of information technology, biomedicine, energy, satellite and space technology, and nuclear technology.""
Moreover, the report said: ""the Skolkovo Foundation has, in fact, been involved in defense-related activities since December 2011, when it approved the first weapons-related project -- the development of a hypersonic cruise missile engine. . . . Not all of the center's efforts are civilian in nature.""
Technology can have multiple uses -- civilian and military. But in 2014 the Boston Business Journal ran an op-ed placed by the FBI, and noted that the agency had sent warnings to technology and other companies approached by Russian venture-capital firms. The op-ed -- under the byline of Lucia Ziobro, an assistant special agent at the FBI's Boston office -- said that ""The FBI believes the true motives of the Russian partners, who are often funded by their government, is to gain access to classified, sensitive, and emerging technology from the companies.""
Ms. Ziobro also wrote that ""The [Skolkovo] foundation may be a means for the Russian government to access our nation's sensitive or classified research development facilities and dual-use technologies with military and commercial application.""
To anyone who was paying attention, the FBI's warnings should have come as little surprise. A State Department cable sent to then-Secretary Clinton (and obtained via WikiLeaks) mentioned possible ""dual use and export control concerns"" related to research and development technology ventures with Moscow. And in its own promotional literature Skolkovo heralded the success of its development of the Atlant hybrid airship.
""Particularly noteworthy is Atlant's ability to deliver military cargoes,"" boasts the Made in Skolkovo publication: ""The introduction of this unique vehicle is fully consistent with the concept of creating a mobile army and opens up new possibilities for mobile use of the means of radar surveillance, air and missile defense, and delivery of airborne troops.""
Even if it could be proven that these tens of millions of dollars in Clinton Foundation donations by Skolkovo's key partners played no role in the Clinton State Department's missing or ignoring obvious red flags about the Russian enterprise, the perception would still be problematic. (Neither the Clinton campaign nor the Clinton Foundation responded to requests for comment.) What is known is that the State Department recruited and facilitated the commitment of billions of American dollars in the creation of a Russian ""Silicon Valley"" whose technological innovations include Russian hypersonic cruise-missile engines, radar surveillance equipment, and vehicles capable of delivering airborne Russian troops.
A Russian reset, indeed.

Hillary Clinton's School Choice,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807838652?accountid=12768,"No one would call the 2016 election a battle of ideas, but it will have policy consequences. So it's worth noting the sharp left turn by Hillary Clinton and Democrats against education reform and the charter schools she and her husband championed in the 1990s.
Mrs. Clinton recently promised a National Education Association (NEA) assembly higher pay, student-loan write-offs, less testing and universal pre-K. She had only this to say about charter schools, which are free from union rules: ""When schools get it right, whether they are traditional public schools or public charter schools, let's figure out what's working"" and ""share it with schools across America.""
The crowd booed, so Mrs. Clinton pivoted to deriding ""for-profit charter schools,"" a fraction of the market whose grave sin is contracting with a management company. Cheering resumed. When she later addressed the other big teachers union, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), she began with an attack on for-profit charters.
We remember when Mrs. Clinton wasn't so easily intimidated by unions. Bill Clinton's grant program took the movement from a few schools to thousands. In Mrs. Clinton's 1996 memoir, ""It Takes a Village,"" she wrote that she favored ""promoting choice among public schools, much as the President's Charter Schools Initiative encourages."" And here's Mrs. Clinton in 1998: ""The President believes, as I do, that charter schools are a way of bringing teachers and parents and communities together.""
But now Mrs. Clinton needs the support of the Democratic get-out-the-vote operation known as teacher unions, which loathe charter schools that operate without unions. The AFT endorsed Mrs. Clinton 16 months before Election Day, and the NEA followed.
Shortly after, in a strange coincidence, Mrs. Clinton began repeating union misinformation: ""Most charter schools, they don't take the hardest-to-teach kids,"" she said on a South Carolina campaign stop in November. But Mrs. Clinton used to know that nearly all charter schools select students by lottery and are by law not allowed to discriminate. The schools tend to crop up in urban areas where traditional options are worst. A recent study from Stanford University showed that charters better serve low-income children, minority students and kids who are learning English.
There's an irony in Mrs. Clinton's pitch that schools should simply share best practices. In 2005 the United Federation of Teachers started a charter school in Brooklyn, N.Y., to prove that unions weren't holding up success. The school rejected the hallmarks of charter schools like New York's Success Academy: order, discipline and other concepts progressives view as oppressive. Principals, for instance, were renamed ""school leaders."" So how's that experiment working out? Grades K-8 didn't meet state standards last year and closed.
Mrs. Clinton's switcheroo follows the pro-union turn of the Democratic Party platform. This year's original draft was at least mildly pro-reform, but the final version opposes using test scores to evaluate teachers, encourages parents to opt out of testing for their kids, and endorses multiple restrictions on charters that would make them much less effective.
The education planks caused Peter Cunningham, an assistant secretary in President Obama's Education Department, to lament that the platform ""affirms an education system that denies its shortcomings and is unwilling to address them."" He called it ""a step backwards"" that will hurt ""low-income black and Hispanic children"" in particular.
In this election year of bad policy choices, the Democratic retreat from school choice and accountability is the most dispiriting.",2016-11-01

If Republican and Democratic officials choose to go that route after this campaign season is behind us, what are the options?
The nomination turmoil on display this year has been a long time coming and is more evidence of the weakened state of the major political parties. A century ago Progressive governors like California's Hiram Johnson and Wisconsin's Robert La Follette began advocating for more direct democracy. They targeted the patronage and corruption linked to urban boss politics; instituted ballot initiatives that allowed voters to circumvent state legislators; and favored primary elections over nominating conventions in an effort to make the process more transparent.
Some reforms from that era were adopted more readily than others, but a tipping point occurred in 1968 at the Democratic convention, when Mayor Richard Daley, who headed Chicago's political machine, passed over Eugene McCarthy, who had won the most primary votes, and delivered the presidential nomination to Hubert Humphrey, who had not even entered a single primary.
After Humphrey lost the general election to Richard Nixon, Democrats gave in to pressure to change the rules so that party leaders would no longer be able to hand-pick convention delegates. The party also required states to choose delegates through primary elections or caucuses.
But party leaders and elected officials didn't like the extent to which the reforms cut them out of the nominating process, and in subsequent decades the rules were altered again to create so-called superdelegates--insiders who play an outsized role in selecting the nominee. Hillary Clinton easily beat out Bernie Sanders this year among superdelegates, who were reluctant to hand over the Democratic nomination to someone they deemed unelectable and who in any case was a registered independent who switched his party affiliation to Democrat shortly before the New Hampshire primary.
Mr. Sanders and his supporters pushed hard for changing the superdelegate rules after he lost the nomination, but in July the party voted to keep them in place with some modifications going forward. The determination--not unreasonable--was that superdelegates helped the Democratic Party police the nomination process in a way that the Republican Party failed.
Reports that the GOP as we know it is dead may be premature, but it's clear that the party is in worse shape than its rival. ""Astonishingly, the 2016 Republican presidential race has been dominated by a candidate who is not, in any meaningful sense, a Republican,"" wrote Jonathan Rauch of the Brookings Institution in the Atlantic magazine over the summer. ""The second-place candidate, Republican Senator Ted Cruz, built his brand tearing down his party's [brand]: slurring the Senate Republican leader, railing against the Republican establishment, and closing the government as a career move.""
Mr. Rauch, who described Messrs. Sanders, Cruz and Trump as ""political sociopaths--meaning not that they are crazy, but that they don't care what other politicians think about their behavior and they don't need to care,"" called for both parties to reform in ways that make nomination procedures less democratic by giving insiders a bigger role. Let parties coordinate with candidates. Lift limits on donations to the parties so that the money isn't diverted to less-accountable outside groups. Force potential candidates to get permission to run as a Democrat or Republican from elected officials who can vet them.
Mr. Rauch's criticisms echo those made in the 1970s by leading political scientists like James Ceaser, who argued that Progressive Era reforms in practice undermined a party selection process that can ""minimize the harmful results of the pursuit of power by ambitious contenders, help establish the proper kind of presidential leadership and proper scope of executive power, help secure a competent executive, ensure a legitimate accession, and provide for the proper degree of choice and change.""
In some cases, efforts to reduce corruption and further democratize the process have also weakened the influence of party leaders in ways that made coordination, accountability and party unity much more difficult. That's a trade-off that ought to at least be acknowledged. There's no need or desire to return to the venal machine politics of New York's Tammany Hall, where Boss Tweed once said, ""I don't care who does the electing, so long as I get to do the nominating.""
But the reality is that politics is about organization, and political insiders know how to organize, how to turn out the vote, and how to pick capable candidates who are less likely to polarize and more likely to win.

"We Really Are Losing Sleep Over the Election; Measurements from Fitbit, Jawbone and Withings show statistically significant changes on nights Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debated",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1834420625?accountid=12768,"Wearable devices that track exercise and other vital signs reveal what many have suspected: The election is making us lose sleep.
The night of the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Sept. 26, Fitbit users nationwide slept an average of 4.2 minutes less than they did the Monday before and the Monday after the debate. Users' average sleep typically varies only about one to two minutes from one Monday to the next, so the change on the debate night is statistically significant, according to San Francisco-based Fitbit.
The numbers are based on average sleep data from 10 million Fitbit users nationwide. The company gets its data when users sync their trackers wirelessly to mobile devices or computers through an app that displays their personal stats. Fitbit aggregates users' data and removes identifying information before analyzing the data.
The debate-night effect was most pronounced for those in the Eastern time zone, with people in Indiana, Florida, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. sleeping at least 10 minutes less on the first-debate night than usual.
But it also appeared in states where the first debate ended hours before a typical bedtime: Californians and Texans both slept at least five minutes less than usual.
""Is it going to have a meaningful effect on your cognitive performance the next day? Probably not,"" says Shelten Yuen, Fitbit vice president of research. But, he adds, ""some people are more affected than others.""
A record 84 million viewers watched the first debate , roughly one-third of the U.S. adult population. The debate was second only to the Super Bowl's 112 million viewers as the most-watched program of 2016. The second and third presidential debates and the vice presidential debate also rank in the top seven most-viewed programs this year.
February's Super Bowl had an even greater effect on sleep, with Fitbit users getting eight minutes less nationwide that night. It's difficult to say whether viewers of the game and the first debate slept less because they were agitated, excited or merely distracted. The Super Bowl game and the debate ended by 10:45 p.m. ET, well before the average bedtime for Fitbit users of 11:44 p.m.
Data from two other wearables companies also show users losing statistically significant amounts of sleep for the first debate and others.
Users of Withings, the digital-health arm of Nokia Technologies, slept nearly five minutes less on the night of the first presidential debate and on the night of the vice presidential debate than they did on the same nights a week earlier. Users slept nearly nine minutes less the night of the final presidential debate. The data come from 13,000 to 15,000 users of Withings activity trackers or connected alarm clocks.
Jawbone says its users slept five minutes less on the nights of the first and second presidential debates than they did on the same nights a year earlier. Users slept three minutes less the night of the vice presidential debate. The findings were based on data from more than 100,000 users of Jawbone's UP wearable devices in all 50 states, a Jawbone spokesman says. Withings and Jawbone also say they aggregate data and remove identifying details before analyzing it.
Owners of wearable devices tend to be slightly younger and significantly wealthier than likely voters. More than 40% of activity-tracker owners have household incomes above $100,000, says Weston Henderek, director of connected intelligence for market-research firm NPD Group Inc.
More than half of U.S. adults say the election is a very or somewhat significant source of stress , according to a recent Harris Poll done on behalf of the American Psychological Association. Registered Democrats (55%) and Republicans (59%) were nearly as likely to say the election is a source of stress. Stress is a common cause of sleep loss .
The poll of about 3,500 adults was done online in August. The full results won't be released until next year, but the APA released a subset of data in October because it was so timely, says Vaile Wright, director of research and special projects at the Washington, D.C.-based APA.
The percentage of adults reporting stress over the election is similar to the share that reported stress about the economy during the depths of the recession of 2007 to 2009, Dr. Wright says. People who use social media were more likely to say this election is a source of stress.
""It's like there's this running tape of worries in somebody's head and they have a hard time turning it off, which results in difficulty falling asleep and also staying asleep,"" Dr. Wright says.
Skipping the final debate on Oct. 19 didn't keep Lisa Bohn, a 42-year-old mother of two in Jonesboro, Ark., from ruminating. After her 6-year-old son woke her up in the wee hours, she scrolled through postdebate chatter on her Facebook feed.
""I was up for another hour because I couldn't shut my brain off,"" says Ms. Bohn, an assistant professor of theater at Arkansas State University. ""It was just sort of gnawing at me.""
Philip Muskin, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, estimates about one-third of his patients mention the election. Some tell him it's affecting their sleep. His female patients especially say they are upset about Mr. Trump's treatment of women.
Dr. Muskin tells patients to limit their exposure to news and social media rather than taking sleeping pills.
""If you're going to sleep at 11:30 p.m., by 10 o'clock you should turn that stuff off and stop getting that kind of stimulation,"" he says. He also teaches patients breathing techniques to use for 10 to 15 minutes before going to bed.
Yik Yak, a smartphone app that lets people create and view discussion threads within a small area such as a college campus, in October polled 5,000 users, the vast majority of them in their late teens to early 20s. About 89% said they're losing sleep over the election, says Hilary McQuaide, Yik Yak's director of communications.
Of those who said they lost sleep, 73% are concerned about the election's aftermath.

How Clinton Will Try to Build on ObamaCare,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1832095010?accountid=12768,"Phil Gramm worries that Hillary Clinton plans to push for a single-payer health-care financing system once elected president (""Where Clinton Will Take ObamaCare,"" op-ed, Oct. 18). We can only hope!
The only way to have affordable and adequate care that doesn't exclude the sick and the marginally poor is a taxpayer-funded system that would expand Medicare to cover all Americans. As long as 15-30 cents of every dollar we spend on private insurance goes toward profit, marketing and exorbitant executive compensation, it will be impossible to achieve reasonable cost and universal coverage.
We already spend more than twice as much per capita for health care than any other country and have nowhere near the best outcomes. I would be surprised if a President Hillary Clinton pushes for a single payer, but good for her and us if she does.
Gerald Gollin, M.D.
Solana Beach, Calif.

Contrary to Phil Gramm's excellent op-ed, the HillaryCare single-payer ""Goliath"" will more likely be public-corporate cartels having the facade of private insurance.
HMO/ACO (accountable-care organization) cartels protected by government sovereignty are now being created through 2011 Federal Trade Commission waivers of antitrust laws. The cartels are enabled to collude in price fixing, franchising and ""gainsharing"" profits through Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waivers of antifee splitting and antiself-referral laws. Further, the 2015 ""doc fix"" law legalizes coercion of clinician gatekeepers at the nation's bedsides to profit the cartels.
Order ""too much"" and gatekeeper pay is deceased -- a ""negative payment adjustment""; order less and pay is increased -- a ""bonus opportunity."" This is fed-speak for volume (or utilization) pay; it is not for ""quality"" or ""value"" pay. Doctors not playing corporate-cartel gatekeeper roles will be out of the income stream.
Mr. Gramm is correct. Goliath ""reforms"" will continue with Hillary Clinton.

Secret Recordings Fueled FBI Feud in Clinton Probe,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1835304804?accountid=12768,"Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said.
Agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called ""Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,"" these people said.
The account of the case and resulting dispute comes from interviews with officials at multiple agencies.
Starting in February and continuing today, investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Capers declined to comment.
The roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department under Hillary Clinton.
Senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI didn't think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldn't let them pursue, they said.
These details on the probe are emerging amid the continuing furor surrounding FBI Director James Comey's disclosure to Congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate, previously closed FBI investigation of Mrs. Clinton's email arrangement while she was secretary of state.
On Wednesday, President Barack Obama took the unusual step of criticizing the FBI when asked about Mr. Comey's disclosure of the emails.
Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI's No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation.
At times, people on both sides of the dispute thought Mr. Capers agreed with them. Defenders of Mr. Capers said he was straightforward and always told people he thought the case wasn't strong.
Much of the skepticism toward the case came from how it started -- with the publication of a book suggesting possible financial misconduct and self-dealing surrounding the Clinton charity. The author of that book, Peter Schweizer -- a former speechwriting consultant for President George W. Bush -- was interviewed multiple times by FBI agents, people familiar with the matter said.
The Clinton campaign has long derided the book as a poorly researched collection of false claims and unsubstantiated assertions. The Clinton Foundation has denied any wrongdoing, saying it does immense good throughout the world.
Mr. Schweizer said in an interview that the book was never meant to be a legal document, but set out to describe ""patterns of financial transactions that circled around decisions Hillary Clinton was making as secretary of state.""
As 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. In February, a meeting was held in Washington among FBI officials, public-integrity prosecutors and Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York -- Mr. Capers' office -- didn't attend, these people said.
The public-integrity prosecutors weren't impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said. ""The message was, 'We're done here,' "" a person familiar with the matter said.
Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions.
Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to ""stand down,"" a person familiar with the matter said.
Within the FBI, some felt they had moved well beyond the allegations made in the anti-Clinton book. At least two confidential informants from other public-corruption investigations had provided details about the Clinton Foundation to the FBI, these people said.
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn't tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out.
Prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics because the person who was secretly recorded wasn't inside the Clinton Foundation.
FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case.
As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn't seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly.
In subsequent conversations with the Justice Department, Mr. Capers told officials in Washington that the FBI agents on the case ""won't let it go,"" these people said.
As a result of those complaints, these people said, a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director, Mr. McCabe, on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions, these people said. The conversation was a tense one, they said, and at one point Mr. McCabe asked, ""Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?"""" The senior Justice Department official replied: ""Of course not.""

In an appearance before the Detroit Economic Club on Monday, Mr. Trump fused his populist message with appeals designed to win support from the left -- such as defraying households' child-care costs -- alongside a full embrace of policies on regulation, corporate taxes and energy production to try to please skeptics on the right.
""All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production,"" Mr. Trump said in a speech crafted to stabilize his campaign after a rocky week.
In St. Petersburg, Fla., Mrs. Clinton fired back at Mr. Trump and his newly announced economic team drawn heavily from real estate and finance. Mr. Trump's tax proposals amount to traditional Republican ""trickle-down economics,"" she said, that ""will give super-big tax breaks to large corporations, just like him and the guys who wrote the speech."" Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to give a speech on the economy on Thursday.
Mr. Trump said he would modify his previous tax-cut proposal to mesh it with the framework advanced this summer by House Republicans. Their plan calls for reducing the seven income-tax brackets to three, at 12%, 25% and 33%.
The revamp would leave the top rate considerably higher than the 25% that Mr. Trump first proposed last fall. Mr. Trump maintained his original plan to cut corporate taxes to 15% but said he now also supports allowing businesses to immediately write off new investments, a change that brings his tax plan closer to that of House Republicans.
The new proposal, coming the week after Mr. Trump was hesitant to endorse several prominent Republicans in their re-election races, looked like ""some sort of peace offering to settle an intraparty squabble,"" said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist who was the policy director for Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and who hasn't endorsed either 2016 nominee. ""He has settled up politically, and he has now done that policy-wise by saying, 'We'll use your tax rates.' ""
Mr. Trump promised to unveil a big infrastructure-spending plan, embracing a goal of Democrats, and said he would propose a new way for households to deduct average child-care costs from their taxes.
It wasn't clear how such a tax break might be structured, how it would complement existing credits and whether it would be available to tens of millions of families that don't pay income taxes because they have lower incomes.
Making child-care expenses deductible, as opposed to offering a tax credit, would be ""a very poorly targeted proposal that would be helpful to high-income households. . .with no significant economic benefits for those who cannot currently afford child care,"" said Chye-Ching Huang, a senior tax analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.
Monday's speech came at a critical moment in Mr. Trump's campaign. The latest round of national polls show him losing ground in the race with Mrs. Clinton. Last week's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found him trailing the Democratic nominee by 9 points, and an average of polls tracked by Real Clear Politics shows Mrs. Clinton with a seven-point lead.
The GOP nominee promised to withdraw from trade pacts, to label China as a currency manipulator and to enforce existing intellectual-property and other trade rules more aggressively. While Mr. Trump has in the past said he would support bilateral trade agreements, he strongly criticized a 2011 accord between the U.S. and South Korea.
He also called Monday for a moratorium on all new regulations from federal agencies, with a specific focus on undoing environmental rules that he said curtail job creation.
Mr. Trump's hourlong speech, delivered from a teleprompter, was less freewheeling than his usual style; though he was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, he paused quietly until they were removed. But he launched plenty of attacks on Mrs. Clinton and what he called the failures of the Obama administration, calling the U.S. unemployment rate, which the Labor Department last week said stood at 4.9% in July, ""one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.""
Mr. Trump has said his message would resonate with the blue-collar workforce of Michigan and other Rust Belt states, and he has vowed to make the state competitive even though it hasn't voted Republican in a presidential race since 1988. In his speech, while lamenting the economic struggles of Detroit, Mr. Trump made no mention of the federal bailout of the auto industry, which was begun by former President George W. Bush, a Republican, in late 2008 and continued by President Barack Obama.
Before the bailout, Mr. Trump gave television interviews indicating support for a government-led rescue of the industry. But during the 2012 election, Mr. Trump said the bailout was a mistake that allowed U.S. auto makers to expand production overseas.
Monday's address offered the latest reminder of how deficit worries have receded as an issue. Mrs. Clinton has promised to pay for much of her new spending with higher taxes on top earners, which would hold deficits at their current levels but do little to reduce them.
Mr. Trump has suggested he would tolerate wider deficits to spend more on infrastructure, veterans' health-care and national defense at the same time that he reduces taxes.

Clinton Should Listen to Kaine on Vocational Schools,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809919213?accountid=12768,"Before he was Hillary Clinton's running mate Sen. Tim Kaine introduced a bill this spring that would provide more funding for career and technical education. A high-school diploma should not only prepare students for college, he said, but also for ""getting a high-skilled job after graduation."" Mr. Kaine, the son of an ironworker and a home-economics teacher, knows the value of learning a trade. But the idea that not everyone should go to college puts him at odds with his new boss.
Mrs. Clinton says that ""every student should be able to graduate from a public college or university in their state without taking on any student debt."" In addition to refinancing the loans of existing borrowers, the former secretary of state promises that community college will be free, that historically black colleges and other minority-serving institutions will get another $25 billion in public funds to help them out of financial trouble, and that child care will be subsidized for parents in school. This plan would cost about $350 billion, but that figure doesn't include the additional funds state governments will be required to provide to qualify for federal grants. And this money is in addition to the roughly $75 billion that the federal government already provides to support higher education.
No doubt the Democratic ticket would say that college and technical education aren't mutually exclusive -- that every student can choose whichever path best suits his aspirations. But in reality, government has stressed college as the path all students should follow, much to the detriment of vocational and technical education. The U.S.'s drive toward universal higher education has mainly succeeded in dumbing down high-school curricula, creating useless college degrees, indebting students, and leaving far too many young people unprepared for the jobs already available to them.
The high dropout rate is one sign that too many people attend higher-education institutions. Only 56% of college students completed four-year degrees within six years, according to a 2011 report from Harvard's Graduate School of Education. Less than 30% completed a two-year degree in three years. Many of the students surveyed reported that cost influenced their decision to leave, while others simply prefer to start working.
Even if they complete college, many graduates won't find jobs -- at least not right away. A 2016 survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that most companies are looking for graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, as well as business-related fields. Only seven of the 201 employers surveyed wanted to hire people who had majored in ""area or gender studies.""
Those with degrees in these politically correct subjects were most likely to be working at age 25 in a job that didn't require a college degree, according to an analysis of 2009 Labor Department data. These facts expose a great myth of this era: A college education is the only path to a decent job.
Mike Rowe, host of the show ""Dirty Jobs,"" recently explained the problem to Forbes magazine. The interviewer asked about unemployed college graduates who say ""there are no good jobs left."" Mr. Rowe responded that one problem ""is the constantly evolving definition of what a 'good' job actually is. Collectively, we've discouraged our kids from pursuing a whole category of perfectly good jobs, because we don't see them as aspirational.""
The bias against vocations, from carpentry and welding to the maintenance of high-tech machinery and computer repair, means that discussions of higher education typically neglect these paths. Philanthropists are more likely to fund scholarships for a few poor students to attend elite colleges, even if the same amount of money would allow dozens of young people to gain certification as electricians, mechanics and computer technicians -- fields in which jobs go unfilled thanks to a shortage of qualified applicants.
Mrs. Clinton's proposals would also benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor. While she claims that debt relief will help the working class, the truth is that high-income borrowers have taken on the most government debt. They assume these risks to pursue careers in high-paying fields like law or medicine. They are also more likely to borrow to pay for room and board while poorer students commute to local schools.
""The richest 25 percent of families hold 40 percent of the student loans, so would receive roughly 40 percent of the benefits of a proposal that allowed all loan debt to be refinanced at lower rates,"" noted
Matthew M. Chingos and Beth Akers of the Brookings Institution. ""On the other side of the income spectrum, the poorest quarter of households would receive less than one-fifth of the benefits of such a proposal.""
For those worried about income inequality, technical and vocational education should receive more emphasis as a path to upward mobility. As Mike Rowe says, ""Learning how to weld, or how to run electric, or how to install a toilet -- these skills can and often do lead to fulfilling careers, balanced lives, and better than average pay. Even if you don't spend the rest of your life working in the trades, there's simply no downside to learning a skill."" Perhaps Mr. Kaine can point this out to his running mate.

Jobs Data a Wild Card in U.S. Presidential Elections; Unclear whether Hillary Clinton will be as helped by improved labor figures as Barack Obama was in his campaigns,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836084384?accountid=12768,"The state of the economy and the job market rumbles through every U.S. presidential election , in some years more fatefully than others.
The financial crisis in 2008, when the country lost 473,000 jobs in October, helped tilt the balance toward Barack Obama. Improving numbers four years later aided in his re-election.
Friday's jobs report notched another month of strong jobs growth , while the 4.9% unemployment rate was the second-lowest in 40 years for the month before a presidential election.
Theoretically, that should be good news for Hillary Clinton, who as the Democratic nominee has had to embrace the Obama economy, for better or worse.
But the question now is whether next week's vote most resembles 1988 or 2000. In both those years, the unemployment rate was low at 5.3% and 3.9%, respectively, and the economy had been booming for years as a relatively popular president had served two terms.
But while voters in 1988 gave Republicans a third term in the White House by electing President George H.W. Bush to succeed Ronald Reagan, a roaring economy in 2000 wasn't enough to catapult Vice President Al Gore into the White House.
This year, Mrs. Clinton has talked up strong jobs numbers while striving not to overstate the economic gains, for risk of sounding deaf to the voter anxieties exploited by her Republican rival, Donald Trump.
The Trump campaign has accentuated any and all weaknesses. On Friday the campaign pointed to the monthly drop in the overall size of the labor force--it fell 0.1% from September but was still 1.7% higher than a year earlier--as one sign of what it called the ""total failures"" of what it called ""the Obama-Clinton economy.""
Employers this year have added an average of almost 181,000 jobs monthly, slightly ahead of the pace that helped Mr. Obama defeat Mitt Romney. The economy added fewer jobs in the months before the 2000 election, but far more--around 261,000 a month--before the 1988 election.
With hiring running at a strong pace and the unemployment rate falling steadily over the past three years, Republicans have turned their focus to other measures of labor slack, especially the labor-force participation rate, currently stuck at its lowest levels since the 1970s.
Those declines partly reflect structural changes in the economy--namely the aging of the workforce. But they also capture other challenges, such as the fading numbers of lower-skilled manufacturing jobs.
Mr. Trump and his supporters have also pointed to the 94.6 million people who aren't in the labor force, the vast majority of whom are either retired, in school or taking care of family. Fewer than 8 million are unemployed, down from more than 12 million in 2012 and 10 million in 2008.

Notable & Quotable: Liberal Unity Explained; 'Hillary Clinton . . . will fortify their grip on the commanding heights of politics and culture.',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1835841640?accountid=12768,"Peter Berkowitz, a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, writing Wednesday at RealClearPolitics.com:
After the voters elect the 45th president of the United States next week, a portentous question will remain: Why did the Republican nominee's larger-than-life defects trigger a civil war among conservatives, while progressives--especially elite progressives--fell into line and rallied around a Democratic nominee whose policy blunders, hypocrisy, and proclivity to lie to the American people to cover up cronyism and lawlessness have been amply documented? . . .
""The Demon in Democracy: Totalitarian Temptations in Free Societies"" might seem an unlikely source of insight into the deep forces driving American electoral politics. Nevertheless, Ryszard Legutko's erudite polemic analyzing the resemblances that liberal democracy in the West bears to the Soviet communism it vanquished clarifies the roots of progressive unity in America and the causes of conservative discord.
Legutko's brilliant book suggests that progressives and left-liberals unite more effectively because they are in harmony with contemporary liberal democracy's liberationist and egalitarian drift--in other words, its tendency to dismantle inherited authorities and pursue equality of result. By contrast, conservatives find much of what they cherish under assault by government's relentless expansion into areas--such as family, faith, and speech--that were once commonly held to be largely beyond state supervision. . . .
Progressives--especially progressive elites--can come together in support of Hillary Clinton because of their confidence that for all her baggage she shares their liberationist and egalitarian understanding of liberal democracy and will fortify their grip on the commanding heights of politics and culture. Donald Trump is not the cause but a symptom of division and disarray among conservatives, who have been rattled and thrown on the defensive by a culture and governing institutions that have taken the other side in a partisan battle over the future of freedom.",2016-11-04
Secret Recordings Fueled FBI Feud in Clinton Probe; Agents thought they had enough material to merit aggressively pursuing investigation into Clinton Foundation,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1835186922?accountid=12768,"Corrections & Amplifications:
Peter Schweizer is the author of ""Clinton Cash."" An earlier version of this article misspelled his surname as Schweitzer. (Nov. 2, 2016)
Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said.
Agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called ""Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,"" these people said.
The account of the case and resulting dispute comes from interviews with officials at multiple agencies.
Starting in February and continuing today, investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Capers declined to comment.
The roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department under Hillary Clinton.
Senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI didn't think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldn't let them pursue, they said.
These details on the probe are emerging amid the continuing furor surrounding FBI Director James Comey's disclosure to Congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate, previously closed FBI investigation of Mrs. Clinton's email arrangement while she was secretary of state.
On Wednesday, President Barack Obama took the unusual step of criticizing the FBI when asked about Mr. Comey's disclosure of the emails.
Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI's No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation.
At times, people on both sides of the dispute thought Mr. Capers agreed with them. Defenders of Mr. Capers said he was straightforward and always told people he thought the case wasn't strong.
Much of the skepticism toward the case came from how it started--with the publication of a book suggesting possible financial misconduct and self-dealing surrounding the Clinton charity. The author of that book, Peter Schweizer--a former speechwriting consultant for President George W. Bush--was interviewed multiple times by FBI agents, people familiar with the matter said.
The Clinton campaign has long derided the book as a poorly researched collection of false claims and unsubstantiated assertions. The Clinton Foundation has denied any wrongdoing, saying it does immense good throughout the world.
Mr. Schweizer said in an interview that the book was never meant to be a legal document, but set out to describe ""patterns of financial transactions that circled around decisions Hillary Clinton was making as secretary of state.""
As 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. In February, a meeting was held in Washington among FBI officials, public-integrity prosecutors and Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York--Mr. Capers' office--didn't attend, these people said.
The public-integrity prosecutors weren't impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said. ""The message was, 'We're done here,' "" a person familiar with the matter said.
Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions.
Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to ""stand down,'' a person familiar with the matter said.
Within the FBI, some felt they had moved well beyond the allegations made in the anti-Clinton book. At least two confidential informants from other public-corruption investigations had provided details about the Clinton Foundation to the FBI, these people said.
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn't tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out.
Prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics, like presenting evidence to a grand jury, because the person who was secretly recorded wasn't inside the Clinton Foundation.
FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case.
As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn't seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly.
In subsequent conversations with the Justice Department, Mr. Capers told officials in Washington that the FBI agents on the case ""won't let it go,"" these people said.
As a result of those complaints, these people said, a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director, Mr. McCabe, on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions, these people said. The conversation was a tense one, they said, and at one point Mr. McCabe asked, ""Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?'' The senior Justice Department official replied: ""Of course not.""

The Clinton Default Mistake,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810507280?accountid=12768,"The decision to default one's vote to Hillary Clinton comes in many forms. She is the lesser of two evils. She is the devil we know.
By all accounts, hell is still hell. Before volunteering to spend four years in it, voters about to commit the sin of despair might consider the consequences of a default vote.
The greatest is the economy. Mrs. Clinton will contribute nothing to lift the flatlined aspirations of the eight Obama years.
There is also the matter of Clinton mores, revealed again Monday in a Washington Post story about the way former Sen. Clinton dealt with the economic plight of upstate New Yorkers. Most relevant was the account of Sen. Clinton pushing federal money to the Corning company on behalf of its emissions-reduction technology:
""Corning's chief executive co-hosted a 2015 fundraiser for her. The company paid her $225,500 in 2014 to speak to Corning executives. Corning also has given more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, its records show.""
Also worth reading are details of the $315,000 eBay gave her for a 20-minute speech last year, but we digress. Our subject is what surely will be the decline and final fall of the American higher-education system under a President Clinton.
The onslaught of political correctness that overwhelmed American campuses the past year may not come up in the presidential debates. But for many voters the campus pillaging of free speech symbolizes a country off the rails.
The New York Times recently ran a piece describing how colleges and universities are experiencing a pull back in alumni giving because of the PC madness. Donations at Amherst fell 6.5% in the last fiscal year. A small-college fundraising organization named Staff reports that giving in fiscal 2016 is down 29% from the year before.
Enraged alumni vent frustration throughout the piece, but one in particular asks, ""Where did this super-correctness come from?"" There is an answer to that question.
A Clinton victory will empower, for a very long time, the forces now putting at risk one of the country's incomparable strengths, its system of higher education.
What happened can be explained in one word: diversity.
This is an idea that degraded into a set of destructive obsessions. Those obsessions then became official, destructive federal policy.
At its inception a few decades back, ""diversity"" described American social structures absorbing new immigrants, alongside blacks and women via affirmative-action commitments. Yes, the immigrant influx is part of the presidential debate, but it is not the subject of this column. Only one political mess a week.
When the schools' presidents began to create offices of diversity affairs, alumni and trustees waved them in as the right thing to do. Bureaucratize an idea, though, and what do you get? More of it than any normal person could want. It is not an overstatement to say that diversity offices are now running American higher education.
Higher-ed's trade newspaper, the Chronicle of Higher Education, publishes a yearly supplement called ""Diversity in Academe."" Its May cover story was ""Who Sets a College's Diversity Agenda?"" The most telling piece inside was: ""Auditing Diversity: An interest in assessments is rising as officials strive to show they are committed.""
The National Center for Education Statistics reports the U.S. has more than 7,000 postsecondary Title IV institutions serving some 21 million students. All university administrators know their next job depends on showing evidence of achieving diversity metrics. So they push them, relentlessly. In 20 years, diversity went from an idea to an industry.
Enter the Obama presidency and the cultural left on steroids. In 2011 the Obama Department of Education sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter to all higher-ed schools, providing ""guidance"" on creating sexual-abuse surveillance systems. This is the letter that shut down traditional due process for college students.
For the presidents of these institutions, the ""guidance"" notice had one key passage. It said that ""if a recipient does not come into compliance,"" the federal government may ""withdraw federal funding.""
Readers of this newspaper do not need more dots connected to understand why nominally sensible college presidents are rolling over like trained puppies to the PC mobs. Resist and Washington will terminate their federal cash flow. None will. All comply. That is raw power.
A President Clinton won't rein in any of this. Accommodating the ascendant anti-intellectual left across America's campuses is easy, because the institutions' own leadership -- presidents and trustees -- don't care. So why should she?
In fact, using the full ""guidance"" powers of the federal enforcement agencies inside Justice, Education, Labor and the EPA against the states and private institutions will be a primary and unaccountable weapon of the Clinton presidency.
This administrative federal power is virtually beyond the reach of Congress. The idea that a President Cruz or Kasich will ""roll it all back"" in 2020 after 12 years of the federal cement drying is just not serious.
The Nov. 8 vote is the last hurdle of accountability for Hillary Clinton. The price of the Clinton default option looks much too high.

Election 2016: Clinton Again Knocks Trump Over Foreign Products,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808567744?accountid=12768,"DENVER -- Hillary Clinton on Wednesday jabbed at Donald Trump's practice of manufacturing his companies' products overseas, building on her argument that the Republican rival is focused on enriching himself more than bolstering U.S. businesses.
The Democratic nominee visited a necktie company in the battleground state of Colorado to underscore the point that some businesses produce neckwear in the U.S. while Trump-brand ties are made in China.
Mrs. Clinton stuck largely to her own script and ignored the controversies swirling around Mr. Trump, such as his quarrel with the family of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq and his unwillingness to endorse top officials in his own party facing re-election.
The turmoil surrounding the Trump campaign has threatened to drown out Mrs. Clinton's own message in recent days, but the former secretary of state has continued to focus on outlining her economic vision.
In Colorado, Mrs. Clinton highlighted her job-creation plan and told supporters that as president she would invest in U.S. manufacturing.
Mrs. Clinton visited the Knotty Tie Co. in Denver, which produces made-to-order neckties, pocket squares, scarves and other accessories. It was one of an assortment of factories and manufacturers in battleground states that the former senator from New York has used as backdrops for her jobs tour as she highlights Mr. Trump's record of producing men's suits, picture frames and other items in foreign countries.
At each stop, Mrs. Clinton has criticized Mr. Trump and his oft-repeated campaign slogan, saying that if the New York businessman wants to make America great again, ""he could start by actually making things in America again.""
At Knotty Tie, where a U.S. flag hung from the ceiling and Hillary-themed ties were on display, Mrs. Clinton offered effusive praise for the ties and scarves, as well as for the company's policy of hiring refugees.
""I wish Donald Trump could meet all of you and see what you are making here and hear the stories of people who have come together to produce products and create more opportunity for more people,"" she said. ""I really would like him to explain why he paid Chinese workers to make Trump ties.""
Mr. Trump has said relatively little about her assertion that he has shipped jobs overseas.
The Republican nominee told ABC News in June that China and other countries have ""taken us to the cleaners"" by devaluing their currency and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete.
""Unfortunately, my ties are made in China, and I will say this, the hats -- 'Make America Great Again' -- I searched long and hard to find somebody that made the hats in this country,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It was a very hard thing to do.""
The Trump campaign website says that items for sale on the site are ""100% made in the USA.""
A new Clinton campaign ad that will begin airing in battleground states this week also aims to remind voters of where Trump-label products are made. The ad shows Mr. Trump touting his clothing line during an October 2012 appearance on the ""Late Show With David Letterman.""
When asked where the ties, shirts and other products are produced, Mr. Trump said, ""I don't know where they were made, but they were made someplace.""
After Mr. Letterman pointed out that the dress shirts came from Bangladesh, Mr. Trump told him, ""It's good. We employ people in Bangladesh.""

"Whoever Wins, Capitalism Will Survive; Don't despair. Trump or Clinton may be a dismal choice. But the U.S. economy is resilient.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836482392?accountid=12768,"As Americans prepare to make what many see as a depressing choice between presidential candidates, they shouldn't despair. Yes, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton don't sound like wise stewards of economic policy. And yes, we have some problems that need serious attention, such as a badly distorted credit market and an unworkable Affordable Care Act. But the American capitalist economy has become extremely powerful and can most likely withstand further abuse, however unwelcome.
It was not always thus. In the 1930s, a much smaller, heavily agrarian American economy was in danger of falling victim to statism. The ""Great Depression"" began in 1929 with a downturn in the business-credit cycle that precipitated a stock-market crash. The market was recovering in 1930 but the real economy didn't rebound as it had after a similar crash in 1920.
New Deal historians called what happened a ""crisis of capitalism."" In fact, capitalism was doing great in the 1920s. Henry Ford was cranking out Model Ts that almost anyone could afford. Housewives were buying labor-saving tools like electric vacuums and washing machines on the installment plan. Fat Sears and Montgomery Ward catalogs offered the bounty of capitalism to dwellers in even the remotest farm houses.
It was public policy that deepened an ordinary recession and prolonged it for a decade. The Depression was a demonstration of what happens when the government responds to a downturn with excessive interference with market forces.
The seeds of the Depression were planted with the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, in a two-year interval in which President Woodrow Wilson had a compliant Democratic Congress. The act set up 12 regional government banks to make preferential loans to farmers. Farmers had done well earlier, so much so that years later they would ask the government to support prices on a parity with the year 1912. But the 1916 government venture damaged country banks with unfair competition and encouraged farmers to overproduce. That lowered prices.
Calvin Coolidge fended off their demands for relief from low prices but Herbert Hoover refinanced the FFLA, suggesting that he was an easier mark than Coolidge. After the 1929 crash, farmers again pressured the Republican Congress for relief, prompting Sen. Reed Smoot of Utah and Rep. Willis C. Hawley of Oregon to draft a bill raising tariffs on farm products. Had Congress stopped there the damage would have been limited. But lobbyists for industry and labor demanded protection as well. The final Smoot-Hawley bill doubled already-high tariffs on 20,000 dutiable items to an average of 50% of value.
Ignoring his own better instincts and a petition signed by more than 1,000 economists, Hoover signed Smoot-Hawley into law. The sharp drop-off in trade that resulted sent prices plummeting, worsening what was already a deflationary cycle caused by the loss of liquidity in the crash. Europeans were inhibited from selling goods in the U.S. to earn dollars to buy U.S. products and pay their war debts. The reduced flow of funds worsened deflation. Europe's retaliation with tariff increases made matters worse. A global money shortage ensued.
U.S. exports nose-dived to $1.7 billion in 1933 from $5.2 billion in 1929, with farmers--big exporters even then--hit the hardest. Democrats swept the 1932 elections but instead of giving the country less market interference they gave it more.
The most egregious was the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, which required businesses to adopt 557 ""codes"" to prevent price cutting. These cartels violated the key principle that market competition is the guarantor of a vigorous, efficient economy. The NIRA veered the U.S. close to European-style fascism, which had many admirers at that time. Fortunately, the Supreme Court put it out of its misery in 1935, declaring it an unconstitutional extension of government power.
Despite Smoot-Hawley, the New Deal's revolutionary farm production quotas, the NIRA and FDR's attacks on capitalism, the business cycle turned upward in 1933. Unemployment fell from nearly a quarter of the labor force that year to 17% in 1936. But then the ""second New Deal"" Congress slapped a tax on ""surplus"" business profits, the equivalent of a tax on job-creating investment. The market crashed again in 1937 and took the economy with it.
In 1940 FDR, to his credit, realized that to rearm a militarily weak America he badly needed the capitalists he had spurned and often reviled. He made peace with them and they responded magnificently, especially after Japan's December 1941 attack, quickly mobilizing their factories to perform amazing feats of weapons production.
That performance, plus the defeat and discrediting of fascists Hitler and Mussolini and the outset of the Cold War with ultra-statist Stalin gave Americans a new appreciation for market capitalism. Largely unfettered in the postwar era, privately owned corporations produced the technological marvels and high living standards we enjoy today.
The system is under threat again. But it is far stronger now than it was in the 1930s. History is not on the side of the statists.
Cheer up, if you can.

New York City Ramps Up Security for Election Day; Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump plan to hold events in Manhattan Tuesday night,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836762660?accountid=12768,"The New York Police Department plans to deploy thousands of officers to protect the city on Election Day, as voters prepare to go to the polls Tuesday amid heightened political tensions and threats of a terrorist attack.
""They're going to see a lot of police, they're going to see a lot of uniforms, they're going to see a lot of marked cars,"" Police Commissioner James O'Neill said Monday. ""New Yorkers should feel good about [Tuesday], that they're going to be in safe hands.""
NYPD officials said they were on high alert after receiving information about a possible attack by the al Qaeda terrorist group aimed at disrupting the presidential election. The threat lacked specificity, officials said. Over the weekend, Islamic State called for attacks on the U.S. on Election Day, officials said.
In a show of confidence Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Mr. O'Neill appeared together alongside NYPD and Secret Service officials in Times Square. They said the city was accustomed to dealing with large events and was prepared to deal with possible terrorism, protests or voter intimidation.
Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump are slated to hold Election Night events in Manhattan. Mrs. Clinton's event is scheduled to be at the Javits Center on the far West Side, and Mr. Trump's event is at the New York Hilton Midtown on Sixth Avenue.
""We have an obligation not only to the people of this city but to this country to make sure that tomorrow all through the day and particularly tomorrow night goes smoothly,"" said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat. ""New York City will never be intimidated.""
NYPD officials said some 5,000 officers would be out on the streets Tuesday, a force that will include heavy weapons teams, counterterrorism units, bomb-sniffing dogs and hundreds of plainclothes officers looking for suspicious activity. They also said officers will be posted at polling sites and would respond to any possible incidents of voter suppression.
Officials said New Yorkers can expect security measures to feel similar to those taken on New Year's Eve. John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence, called the approach, ""an all-out posture"" that has become ""part of the new normal for New York City.""
Police officials said they had taken extra security measures because both major candidates were expected to be in New York City Tuesday night.
The city will see extensive traffic closures on Tuesday. Beginning Tuesday morning, 34th Street will be closed, as well as 11th Avenue between 34th Street and 40th Street. The area surrounding Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue will be closed while Mr. Trump is in the building, as will the area surrounding the Hilton.
Mr. O'Neill said keeping the city safe was a shared responsibility.
""If anyone sees something tomorrow that doesn't look right, doesn't feel right, let one of our officers know about it,"" he said. ""Or call 911.""

Dollar Gains as Clinton Victory Looks More Likely; The dollar posts strong gains on the perception of increased chances of a Hillary Clinton victory over Donald Trump in this week's U.S. elections.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836486211?accountid=12768,"0940 GMT The U.S. dollar posts strong gains on the perception of increased chances of a Hillary Clinton victory over Donald Trump in this week's U.S. elections after the FBI said no new evidence was found to warrant charges against Clinton. The dollar index trades up 0.7%, with EUR/USD down 0.8% at $1.1052, USD/JPY up 1.5% at 104.62 and GBP/USD down 1% at $1.2395. The Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar both gain against the dollar, however, with USD/MXN down 2% at 18.620 and USD/CAD down 0.1% at 1.3394. A Trump win would be seen as very negative for these currencies, especially MXN, due to concerns about protectionist policies. Ebbing risk aversion also helps emerging market currencies, with USD/RUB down 0.9% and USD/ZAR down 0.9%.

"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, This Is Your One Shot at the Presidency; Since Nixon defeated McGovern in '72, the unwritten rule has been once you're out, you're out.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836093495?accountid=12768,"Even before the presidential campaign turned so bizarre, one truth should have been abundantly evident to both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: The one who finishes in second place on Tuesday night won't be his or her party's nominee for the presidency in 2020. It is predestined--or at least it is what recent American political history irrefutably teaches us.
More than half a century has passed since a defeated presidential candidate later went on to be nominated again by his party. In 1960 Richard Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy; the Republicans turned to him again in 1968, when he defeated Hubert Humphrey, and again in 1972, when he defeated George McGovern.
Since then the unwritten rule has been, once you're out, you're out. It doesn't matter how highly regarded you may be among your fellow Republicans or Democrats on the evening they nominate you: If they have made you their standard-bearer and then you lose, no matter how narrowly, your prospects for being given another opportunity are zero. In the land of second chances, vanquished presidential nominees need not apply.
This is a relatively new phenomenon. Earlier in the nation's history it was quite common for a presidential candidate to lose and then to be given one (or more) opportunities to head his party's ticket. The person was presumed to possess the same qualities, principles and talents that made him good enough to be a nominee in the first place.
Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, was elected president in 1884, but lost his re-election bid to Benjamin Harrison in 1888. The Democrats turned right back to him in 1892, when he defeated Harrison. The Democrats liked William Jennings Bryan enough to nominate him in 1896; he lost to William McKinley, but the Democrats had him lead their party against McKinley again in 1900. Bryan lost that time, too, but by 1908 his party was having him lead the ticket once more. He lost to William Howard Taft.
Republican Thomas E. Dewey lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the election of 1944, but that didn't stop his party from running him against Harry Truman in 1948. Adlai Stevenson was the Democrats' nominee against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952; Ike won in a landslide, but when 1956 rolled around, the Democrats went with Stevenson anew.
Since Nixon, though, every election-night candidate who has come in second, regardless of how experienced or gifted, has been considered as disposable as a grocery-shelf item whose sell-by date has passed. No ""We'll get 'em next time, pal."" Do modern-era presidents who have served a term and then lost an election have an honest hope of being asked to lead their party's ticket one more time? Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush discovered the answer to that.
In today's America the measure of public devotion is calculated in social media fans. In the world of popular culture, Kim Kardashian West has 48.8 million Twitter followers; her husband, Kanye West, has 26.4 million. Singer Britney Spears has 48.6 million; actor Leonardo DiCaprio has 16.4 million; basketball star LeBron James has 33.4 million.
Very impressive numbers. Marketers swoon over them. But consider this:
More than 50 million Americans voted for Al Gore in 2000. More than 59 million voted for John Kerry in 2004. More than 59 million voted for John McCain in 2008. More than 60 million voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. And those tens of millions of voters who put their faith in their candidates had to do more than touch a ""follow"" button on a smartphone screen. They had to leave the house, many of them in brutal November weather; they had to get up early so they could vote before work, or get home late so they could vote after the factory whistle blew. They had to stand in long lines. They had to make a genuine effort to show their loyalty.
Yet for each of the rejected candidates with the huge followings, people who had risen over the years to the highest echelons of their respective parties, who had built up the good will of all those voters, the morning-after presumption was: You're done. They each now carried the most insurmountable, indelible label a presidential candidate can bear: runner-up.
It will soon happen to either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. The one who fails to prevail won't be back in 2020. The strange game of leading a major-party ticket has become a single-elimination tournament. It has turned into the political-world version of the promotional catchphrase heard on television every year during the National Basketball Association playoffs: Win or go home.

Election 2016: Congress To Be Given FBI Notes On Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811510655?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation is preparing to hand over to Congress interview notes from its probe of Hillary Clinton's emails, as well as a summary of the evidence uncovered by its agents, according to people familiar with the decision.
The FBI and the State Department are currently discussing which portions of the agents' summary of their July 2 interview with Mrs. Clinton can be handed over to lawmakers, these people said.
The FBI is planning to turn over the summaries of interviews with other Clinton aides, these people said. Other investigative material also will likely be turned over, including the FBI's broader summary of the facts of the investigation, as well as copies of the 110 emails that contained information that was classified at the time they were sent. There could be significant redactions in the material to be provided to lawmakers as classified information, they said.
The FBI launched an inquiry to see if classified data was criminally mishandled through Mrs. Clinton's use of private email while she was secretary of state. That probe ended last month, when FBI Director James Comey said he wouldn't recommend criminal charges, though he said investigators had found ""extremely careless"" behavior.
The sharing of investigative details from the FBI increases the likelihood that Mrs. Clinton's email scandal will remain an issue in the presidential campaign. Polls show Mrs. Clinton with a widening lead over Republican Donald Trump.
House Republicans had asked the FBI to provide the documents, in part because they claim Mrs. Clinton lied about her use of the private email and the extent to which that put classified data at risk.
Two senior Republicans renewed calls Monday for federal prosecutors to pursue a perjury case against Mrs. Clinton for statements she made to Congress. In a letter, Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) and Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) identified four instances in which they said Mrs. Clinton's hearing testimony was contradicted by the FBI's findings.
At a campaign event last week, former President Bill Clinton defended his wife, saying the accusation that she received information marked classified ""is the biggest load of bull I've ever heard.""
Mr. Comey has said Mrs. Clinton was truthful in her private interview with agents, but has declined to address whether she was honest in her public statements.

"Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Clinton's Test: Energy on Left, Opening on Right",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811510420?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is in an enviable position. And a tough one, too.
By every metric possible, she is leading in the presidential race, and comfortably. She privately tells associates she expects the race against Donald Trump to tighten, but for now every national poll and every battleground state poll tells the same upbeat story for her.
Yet she also is caught in a kind of political and ideological no-woman's land. The energy in her Democratic Party is all on the left, where suspicions of her moderate instincts still run high. Meanwhile, the historic opening Mr. Trump is presenting her is on her right, among independents and moderate Republicans who don't want to be part of the angry populist version of the GOP that he is leading.
As that suggests, there now are in a sense three political parties in the U.S.: The Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren liberals; the Donald Trump angry populists; and the socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrists searching for a place to go. (Ideological conservatives are the odd folks out right now, left to either make their peace with the Trump version of the Republican or hope they can get the party back when he is done using it.)
Mrs. Clinton is trying to draw from all three streams. That is, she seeks to placate her own party's liberals, to pull back some of those traditionally Democratic white working-class males tempted to defect to Mr. Trump, and to woo moderate Republicans now willing to jump ship.
Doing all those things at once is a tough assignment. Thus Mrs. Clinton is running a television ad that starts with her pledge to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and to impose a new tax on companies who move their headquarters abroad, which pleases the left and the populists. It then suggests she will spend all that money on big new infrastructure projects. That is pleasing to both business interests who want the nation's transportation and communications networks upgraded, as well as working-class Americans who stand to get the jobs needed to make the improvements.
Similarly, she has moved toward Mr. Sanders on the question of college costs, offering a plan that would use government aid to make college tuition-free for students from families making $85,000 a year or less. In a nod to the left, that is a step toward the college free-for-all idea Mr. Sanders was promoting. But in a nod to the center, it is less than the bonanza Mr. Sanders was offering.
The fiscally responsible part of Mrs. Clinton worries about how to pay for even that slimmed-down college plan -- while some in her party tell her not to bother worrying about that. If neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Sanders tried to make the numbers add up in their economic plans, they argue, why should she?
And on national-security matters, Mrs. Clinton continues promising, or at least hinting, that she will be tougher than President Barack Obama has been. Her website speaks of ""intensifying"" the air campaign against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria. And, in a slap at Mr. Trump's friendly nods toward Russia's leader, she says she will ""stand up"" to Vladimir Putin.
Those promises are what you'd expect from a former secretary of state who has consistently shown a hawkish side that puts her somewhere in a center-right spot on the national-security spectrum. It is a position that is comfortable for moderates, yet matches neither Mr. Trump's nationalist promises to pull back from commitments to alliances abroad, nor the wishes of those liberals who booed and chanted ""no more war"" as former Defense Secretary and Central Intelligence Agency chief Leon Panetta spoke at the Democratic National Convention.
Mrs. Clinton stands in the midst of these big forces. Part of her predicament was captured humorously in a weekend show by Chicago's famed Second City comedy troupe, during which a series of actors portraying Sanders voters filed onto stage and one by one painfully sought to say, after stammering and mumbling around, that they were sort of, kind of, well, probably going to vote for Hillary.
Juxtaposed against that bloc of reluctant Sanders voters is the historic opportunity for Democrats to claim some significant real estate in the political center thanks to Mr. Trump's weakness there.
This situation tells us two big things about the future. First, even if Mrs. Clinton wins, governing won't be easy, because all these disparate strands will be on display in a new Congress next year.
And second, regardless of the precise outcome of this year's presidential election, a realignment of the two major political parties is under way. We are in an odd situation in which neither presidential candidate is in full control of his or her party. Instead, a great sorting out has begun.

Election 2016: Clinton Stresses Trade Pact Stance,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810757212?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton sought to boost her populist appeal against Donald Trump with her fiercest rejection yet of a Pacific trade pact she once lauded and an attack on Mr. Trump's economic proposals as a crony giveaway.
Speaking Thursday in Warren, Mich., Mrs. Clinton offered little new policy but provided one of her more pointed critiques of American trade practices. She flatly stated she would oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact that is a top priority of President Barack Obama.
""I oppose it now. I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president,"" said the former secretary of state.
Mr. Trump, responding during a rally in Kissimmee, Fla., on Thursday night, said her opposition to the trade pact wasn't sincere. ""If she were ever in a position to approve it, she would approve it in two minutes,"" he said.
Mrs. Clinton's remarks came two days after Mr. Trump's address in Detroit that sought to refocus his campaign with an agenda to sharply cut taxes and regulation while advancing a more protectionist trade policy.
In response, Mrs. Clinton hammered Mr. Trump's revamped tax policy as a regressive windfall for the wealthiest Americans, policies she said fused traditional Republican supply-side economics with ""outlandish 'Trumpian' ideas that even Republicans reject.""
Mr. Trump, addressing the National Association of Home Builders in Miami Beach, Fla., earlier Thursday, said Mrs. Clinton's attacks were an attempt to deflect attention from her proposals to raise taxes and maintain a suite of new regulations championed by Mr. Obama.
If Mrs. Clinton were to win the election, ""enjoy your tax increase, folks,"" he said. ""It's going to be four more years of Obama, but it'll be worse.""
Mrs. Clinton, speaking at a manufacturer of aerospace materials, said too many U.S. companies had pushed for trade pacts to export abroad, only to move their operations abroad and export to the U.S. But she said Mr. Trump's tough talk on trade was motivated by fear and would do little for American workers.
Mrs. Clinton has struggled to shake concerns that, once elected, she would tack to the center on trade policy. Mr. Obama did just that in 2008, promising during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement but pursuing new agreements, including the TPP, once elected.
Mrs. Clinton looked to use Mr. Trump's policy speech on Monday to set sharp contrasts on which candidate would deliver for the average worker.
She branded Mr. Trump's proposal to slash taxes on so-called pass-through entities, where business income is claimed on individual tax returns, as the ""Trump loophole."" Mr. Trump has said he would reduce the top personal tax rate to 33% from 39.6%, but to help small businesses, he has proposed taxing pass-through income at 15%, which is lower than what House Republicans put forward in their tax-code proposal this summer.
Mrs. Clinton said the change could potentially deliver a huge benefit to Mr. Trump's companies and other financiers who were announced as economic advisers to his campaign last week.

The Clinton Plan's Growth Deficit,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810711990?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's big speech on Thursday laying out her economic proposals included much of what you'd expect -- calls for higher taxes on ""Wall Street, corporations, and the superrich."" The centerpiece was her call for ""the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II."" Reading the speech, and detail on the campaign website, I'm not encouraged.
America's foremost economic problem is sclerotic growth. If the economy continues to expand at only 1% to 2% a year, instead of the historical 3% to 4%, then current economic and political problems will become crises. Almost everything depends on growth: progress for the middle class, hope for the unfortunate, solvency for social programs, environmental protection, defense.
This is not a contentious or partisan statement. Larry Summers, Democratic economic adviser extraordinaire, wrote recently in the Washington Post that growth is ""the single most important determinant of almost every aspect of economic performance,"" and that trying to boost it ""has been discredited in the minds of too many progressives.""
So, how does Mrs. Clinton diagnose and suggest to cure the country's stagnation? Her central pro-growth proposal is ""infrastructure"" spending, $275 billion over five years, financed in part by some sharply higher taxes.
Sure, America's roads and bridges could use patching. But how does this fix the growth problem? Nobody thinks that stagnant growth is centrally the fault of bad roads and bridges. No, the economic argument behind Mrs. Clinton's proposal is simply the endless drumbeat of fiscal stimulus: Spend taxed or borrowed money on anything, and the ""multiplier"" will increase ""demand.""
We've been at this since 2008. But the caution that stimulus should be ""timely, targeted, and temporary"" has now been forgotten. Japan's massive ""infrastructure"" spending and weak growth to show for it are forgotten. And if U.S. growth hasn't been kick-started by the trillions of stimulus so far -- the government has accumulated $8 trillion of debt since the recession began -- how will another $50 billion a year help?
Further, why are roads and bridges still a problem? President Obama has been after ""infrastructure"" stimulus since 2009. If you ask that question, and listen to answers, they are pretty clear. It's nearly impossible to build infrastructure these days. Endless regulatory reviews and legal challenges bog down builders. The Davis-Bacon Act, which mandates prevailing wages, and other contracting restrictions balloon costs. Politicians and agencies pick terrible projects -- high-speed trains to nowhere. Even those can't get built. President Obama discovered how few projects are ""shovel-ready."" Opposition to throwing money down a rathole is not pigheaded.
In return for more spending, Mrs. Clinton could have offered serious structural reforms: repeal of Davis-Bacon, time limits on environmental reviews, serious cost-benefit analysis, and so forth. Such a package would have been irresistible.
Instead her plan simply asserts that Mrs. Clinton will ""break through Washington gridlock"" and ""cut red tape"" -- promises made and forgotten by every presidential candidate in living memory. If the Sierra Club sues to block her worthy commitment to ""upgrade our dams and levees,"" will she really short-circuit the legal process, and how?
The rest of Mrs. Clinton's economic agenda is a thousand-course smorgasbord of government expansions, with the same deficiencies. A random sample: Higher taxes on capital gains and corporations. New taxes on financial transactions. A corporate exit tax. Paid leave. Free college. A higher minimum wage. More federal training programs. Tax credits for apprenticeships and profit-sharing programs. A ""new markets"" credit. Rural business investment cooperatives. The Paycheck Fairness Act. ""Make it in America Partnerships."" And on and on.
Moreover, much of it is merely aspiration, without (yet) concrete action: ""Restore collective bargaining rights."" ""Strengthen overtime rules."" ""Make quality affordable childcare a reality."" ""Ensure that the jobs of the future in caregiving and services are good-paying jobs."" ""Break down barriers to make affordable housing and homeownership possible for hard working families."" And on and on and on.
The ""plan"" offers neither a strategy for enactment, nor thought about why these are problems in the first place. Yes, it's hard to find quality affordable childcare. Why? Could licensing, zoning, teachers unions, minimum wages, ObamaCare mandates, employee time rules, taxes, immigration restrictions and the like have something to do with it? Apparently, every problem in America occurs because the president did not ""fight"" hard enough for new programs and against the dark forces that oppose progress. Like a hyperactive overachiever approaching a mock-U.N. debate, Mrs. Clinton seems to trust that the opposition will wilt from the sheer volume, detail and righteousness of her proposals.
Her speech Thursday at least identifies the problem: ""Powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress."" To counter this, she offers ""hard but respectful bargaining,"" and ""leadership that rises above personal attacks.""
For a candidate with such vaunted political experience, that plan seems surprisingly naive. It invites obvious jokes: Yes, you and your party also know something about ""special interests,"" ""ideology,"" ""gridlock"" and ""personal attacks,"" don't you -- as in the rest of this speech. Why should voters expect that to change?
If Mrs. Clinton is elected president, this plan will lead to a chaotic first year. Her administration will unleash a flurry of proposals. Congress will block most. Executive orders and administrative rules will follow, many of which will end up in court. Economic growth will continue to sputter.
Mrs. Clinton: Please don't do it. Find a few simple governing principles. Listen to your opponents. Fix the structure of government. Ask why things are broken, despite good people's best efforts. Spend a little time cleaning up old programs too.
This mild criticism does not imply an endorsement of Mr. Trump's economic musings. The coherent alternative vision lies in Paul Ryan's agenda, ""A Better Way,"" and the plans of the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson. After a likely landslide loss for Mr. Trump, and Trumpism, their ideas will define the opposition. Through better policy and better governance under the rule of law, those ideas do promise a surge in prosperity for all Americans.

Email Questions Haunt Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810711694?accountid=12768,"The email controversy that Hillary Clinton hoped had died out when federal prosecutors closed their investigation last month now looks likely to shadow her campaign all the way through Election Day.
Rolling releases of emails from Mrs. Clinton's time as secretary of state, combined with her own failure to provide succinct, consistent answers on her email practices, have kept the issue simmering.
""Any time she talks about it or engages someone on the issue, it just keeps the story alive rather than letting it go away,"" said Andrew Ricci, a former aide to two Democratic congressmen who is a vice president at the public relations and crisis communications firm Levick.
The drumbeat is undercutting Mrs. Clinton's candidacy and hindering her efforts to seize fuller control of the presidential race by painting Republican rival Donald Trump as an unacceptable alternative.
Last October, 42% of people polled said her use of a private email system while secretary of state was an ""important factor"" in whether to vote for her, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed. A survey last month found that figure had jumped to 55%.
What's more, half of voters surveyed said she lacked the right judgment to be president based on a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that showed she was careless in handling sensitive government information, compared with one-third who said she does have the right judgment.
John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, said: ""She's said probably about a hundred times now, it [the private email server] was a mistake, wouldn't do it again. She's learned from it.""
However, Mr. Podesta conceded the issue has lingered. ""It's a problem that we've had to cope with, but I think it's one we've tried to put behind us and people are going to have to weigh that against an opponent on the other side who remains kind of outrageous every day,"" he said.
The campaign's decision to eschew news conferences also limits Mrs. Clinton's ability to put the issue to rest. The Democrat hasn't held a full news conference since Dec. 4, 2015, although aides said she has taken more than 2,600 questions from reporters this year on a variety of subjects.
Mrs. Clinton did take questions from reporters after an appearance last week, and offered a new, and muddled, response to the email flap that stirred fresh headlines.
""Her fear of the media -- which manifests itself by her refusal to regularly do press conferences -- only furthers her reputation as a politician that values secrecy over transparency,"" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. ""I think she has made a mess of it, but it doesn't resonate because everybody is watching the more fascinating train wreck that is the Trump campaign.""
Mr. Trump has called the email scandal evidence that Mrs. Clinton lacks the judgment to occupy the Oval Office. In a tweet last month, he wrote that she and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information"" and ended with the words ""Not Fit!""
Mrs. Clinton's challenge is compounded by the fact that it is multifaceted: She has been criticized for hosting her email on a private server as well as for the content of some of her messages, those of top aides and correspondence from people who didn't work for her.
A conservative watchdog group released this week about 300 pages of emails that included instances of Clinton Foundation officials asking State Department aides to provide foundation donors access to government officials.
Mr. Trump said the emails pointed to what he called ""pay for play,"" a charge the Clinton campaign denied. The campaign also noted that Mrs. Clinton wasn't part of those email conversations among various staff members.
More emails are likely to be released over the coming months, as a raft of advocacy groups and media outlets have sued the State Department for everything from Mrs. Clinton's schedules to deleted messages recovered by the FBI during its investigation into her private email account and server.
While Mrs. Clinton said she had turned over all her work-related correspondence, agents found thousands of previously undisclosed work emails and have been giving them to the State Department. Those emails are expected to come out, too, though the timeline is uncertain.
""As we have just received this material from the FBI we are still assessing what our process will look like,"" said State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau.
Driving the issue as well are Mrs. Clinton's varying explanations of her email practices. For months she was reluctant to concede she had done anything wrong in using a private server to do government work.
Then, when she couldn't ignore the issue, she has explained her actions in the best possible light, diving into the particulars of government email classification procedures in ways that some communications experts say haven't always aided her case.
""It's clear that the choice of a private email server was a mistake. It's also clear that an inconsistent pattern of responses has not been helpful,"" said Stephen Farnsworth, author of ""Spinner in Chief: How Presidents Sell their Policies and Themselves.""
In May, the State Department's inspector general released a report that seemed to undercut Mrs. Clinton's defense. He wrote that her exclusive use of a private email server wasn't permitted under department policies.
In an ABC News interview the next day, she again said what she had done was ""allowed,"" though she added she had made a ""mistake"" that she wouldn't repeat.
More recently, Mrs. Clinton told Fox News Sunday that FBI Director James Comey ""said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people,""
Though Mr. Comey said she hadn't lied in her private interview with the FBI last month, he declined to characterize remarks she has made publicly.
That exchange touched off another round of inquiries by fact-checkers and critics. PolitiFact, a nonpartisan website that rates the truthfulness of political comments, declared Mrs. Clinton's assertion ""Pants on Fire!""

Politics & Ideas: It's Clinton's Election to Lose,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810257685?accountid=12768,"Barring a dramatic change in voters' perceptions of the presidential candidates or an event that reconfigures the political playing-field, Donald Trump cannot win the 2016 election. The key evidence is not the top-line poll numbers but the entrenched attitudes that drive these numbers, coupled with underlying fundamentals of the contest.
A threshold question is whether aspirants for the presidency are qualified to occupy the office. When the campaign began in earnest last fall, 37% of Americans thought that Mr. Trump met that test, while 60% did not. Today, according to the most recent ABC/Washington Post survey, 38% think he does and 61% that he does not. Many other surveys find much the same. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton clears the hurdle with room to spare: 60% believe she is qualified to be president.
The most recent Fox News survey probed the reasons why so many Americans have reached these conclusions: 64%, including 36% of Republicans believe Mrs. Clinton has the right temperament to serve as president; only 37% say this of Mr. Trump. Fully 72%, including 52% of Republicans think that Mrs. Clinton possesses the knowledge a president needs, compared to 40% for Mr. Trump. The most recent ABC/Washington Post poll found that 79% believe he fails to show enough respect for those he disagrees with, and 58% regard this as a ""major"" problem.
There is more bad news for the Republican nominee. Mr. Trump has divided his party, while Mrs. Clinton has united hers. She is expanding the Electoral College map, forcing Republicans to spend time and resources defending states such as Georgia, Arizona and even Utah, while Mr. Trump's effort to challenge Mrs. Clinton in the Rust Belt is falling short. Demographic changes continue to diversify the voting-age population to her benefit, while his standing among minority voters trails even Mitt Romney's.
Conservative pundits repeat the same mantra: Hillary Clinton is the status quo candidate in a change election. As the lawyers would say, true but not dispositive. When voters believe that it is time for a change, insurgent candidates face a double task -- to convince voters not only that they stand for change, but that they offer the change the voters want.
According to a July survey from the Pew Research Center, 77% of Americans believe Mr. Trump would change the way things work in Washington compared to only 45% for Mrs. Clinton. But of that 77%, 44% think he would change things for the worse versus 33% who think the change would be for the better. The most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey finds that while Mr. Trump leads by 48% to 26% as the candidate better suited to change business as usual in Washington, Mrs. Clinton holds a 42% to 36% edge as the candidate more likely to change the country for the better.
Another favorite conservative talking-point is that voters want an anti-establishment candidate in 2016, not a Washington veteran. This proposition is a classic case of analytical myopia: It holds true for the Republican Party, which is why Mr. Trump won the nomination, but not for the electorate as a whole. The ABC/Washington Post survey found that 58% of Americans want the next president to have experience with how the political system works; only 39% prefer someone from outside the establishment. Last fall, Americans were divided on this issue by a nearly identical 57/39 margin. There is no reason to believe they will change their minds between now and Election Day.
A third bastion of conservative consolation: Americans want a president they can trust, and they do not trust Hillary Clinton. This is true, but with a vital caveat. The Fox News survey found that only 36% of voters believe that Mrs. Clinton is ""honest and trustworthy"" while 61% do not. Unfortunately for Mr. Trump's boosters, their champion fares no better, since 36% also consider him honest and trustworthy.
Beyond the survey data is mounting evidence that electoral fundamentals are shifting in the direction of the candidate seeking to succeed a two-term incumbent of her own party. President Obama's job approval has risen steadily in recent months and now stands at 51%. After an extended period of near-stagnation, wide growth has accelerated. Median household incomes have finally recovered from the Great Recession, according to Sentier Research. According to Fox News, the share of Americans reporting that they are getting ahead financially has risen from a low of 24% in 2013 to 35% today, while satisfaction with the way things are going in the country has increased from 37% to 44% since January.
The presidential debates are Mr. Trump's last chance to reverse the flow of the 2016 contest. If he does not clearly prevail, and unless the economy falls off a cliff or a major terrorist incident changes the context, Mrs. Clinton should win a comfortable victory.

Election 2016: Group Releases New Clinton Emails --- Documents show Clinton Foundation official sought access to State Department,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810255964?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- A conservative watchdog groupon Tuesdayreleased 296 pages of emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's personal server, including exchanges that weren't handed over to the government as part of the Democratic nominee's archive.
The new emails, released by the group Judicial Watch, offer fresh examples of how top Clinton Foundation officials sought access to the State Department during Mrs. Clinton's tenure. The documents wereobtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch against the State Department.
The Clinton Foundation didn't immediately return a request for comment.
In an exchange from April 2009, a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton told three of Mrs. Clinton's top advisers that it was ""important to take care of"" a particular person, whose name has been redacted from the document.
That person had written the aide, Clinton Foundation official Doug Band, under the subject line ""A favor. . ."" to thank him for the ""opportunity to go on the Haiti trip,"" which the person called ""eye-opening."" Mr. Band was a chief adviser in helping Mr. Clinton launch the Clinton Foundation after leaving the White House.
Huma Abedin, a longtime confidante of Mrs. Clinton who is now working for her campaign, replied to Mr. Band: ""We have all had him on our radar. Personnel has been sending him options.""
In a separate exchange, Mr. Band asked Ms. Abedin and Cheryl Mills, another top aide to Mrs. Clinton, to set up a meeting between a State Department official and a top donor to the Clinton Foundation.
""We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person re Lebanon,"" Mr. Band wrote in April 2009. ""As you know, he's key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon. Very imp.""
Mr. Band didn't return a request for comment.
Mr. Chagoury, a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire, has donated between $1 million and $5 million to the foundation, according to its disclosures.
The Nigerian embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to inquiries about Mr. Chagoury.
A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign said in a statement: ""Neither of these emails involve the secretary or relate to the foundation's work. They are communications between her aides and the president's personal aide, and indeed the recommendation was for one of the secretary's former staffers who was not employed by the foundation.""
The latest emails provided further fodder for Republicans who have been critical of Mrs. Clinton's ties to her family's foundation during her time at the State Department.
The new email revelations delivered a second interruption to Mrs. Clinton's efforts to win over voters during campaign stops in Florida this week.
At a Kissimmee rally on Monday, sitting near Mrs. Clinton was Seddique Mateen, father of Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando. Local TV reporters spotted Mr. Mateen, who later described himself as a Clinton supporter. In a statement, a Clinton campaign official said the campaign hadn't invited Mr. Mateen to the rally and wasn't aware of his presence until after the event. A Clinton campaign spokesman said Mrs. Clinton disagrees with Seddique Mateen's views and disavows his support.

"New York Area Voters Go to the Polls; Clinton is favored in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, but congressional races in the region are hotly contested",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836956969?accountid=12768,"Voters headed to the polls Tuesday morning in the New York region for what is expected to be a high-turnout election, but the bitterly contested race for president isn't expected to be competitive in the tri-state area.
Polls show Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, beating Republican nominee Donald Trump, a Manhattan businessman, in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.
No matter who wins the presidential race, New York's standing in the nation's capital stands to get a major boost next year.
A New Yorker appears to be heading to the Oval Office, and Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who is expected to glide to re-election Tuesday, is slated to be his party's leader in the upper chamber
Further down the ballot, there are a number of competitive contests throughout the region, from tight House races to thorny ballot referendums.
New York
Democrats in Albany are hoping to ride Mrs. Clinton's coattails and gain control of the state Senate, which is currently led by Republicans who have the support of a breakaway faction of Democrats. The Democrats have invoked Mr. Trump in hopes of getting better turnout in the races, even though Mr. Trump is popular in some stretches upstate.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has surprised some in his party by taking an aggressive role stumping for Senate Democrats this year. In 2014, Mr. Cuomo had been accused of not doing enough to help Democrats win control of the Senate, where a number of Democratic priorities have been blocked by the GOP.
Senate Republicans have been backed by charter-school supporters and real-estate developers among others, and they have frequently cited New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the prospect of higher taxes as a reason to vote Republican. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, is unpopular in much of the state.
State Sen. Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat who is running to succeed Rep. Charles Rangel in the state's 13th Congressional District, is expected to win Tuesday and become the first Dominican-American elected to the House. If Mr. Espaillat prevails, the district won't be represented in the House by an African-American for the first time in more than 70 years.
One of the most competitive contests in the state is the race for the 19th Congressional District in the Hudson Valley, where Zephyr Teachout, a liberal lawyer who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Cuomo in 2014, is taking on John Faso, a Republican former state legislator.
In the Third Congressional District, which encompasses a swath of Long Island and a part of Queens, Democrat Tom Suozzi and Republican Jack Martins are competing to succeed Rep. Steve Israel, a Democrat. Mr. Suozzi is ahead in the polls.
In another race on Long Island, Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican, is attempting to fend off Democrat Anna Throne-Holst. Mr. Zeldin, a firebrand who won office in 2014, is expected to be re-elected.
New Jersey
A House race in New Jersey has proved particularly nasty and could have national implications. Rep. Scott Garrett, a Republican and longtime representative, faces a stout challenge from Josh Gottheimer, a longtime Democratic operative.
Mr. Gottheimer has gained ground after Mr. Garrett made comments in private about not supporting Republican fundraising efforts because they helped candidates who supported gay marriage. The remarks were widely perceived as antigay.
The race is considered a toss up and has been particularly vicious, with both candidates accusing the other of being liars in a recent debate.
Voters will get to decide Tuesday whether to allow casino gambling in the northern part of New Jersey. Interest groups have poured more than $20 million into the referendum, and the move to allow casinos outside Atlantic City is expected to fail.
Earlier this year, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and legislative leaders raised the state's gas tax by 23 cents a gallon, and now voters face a ballot question on whether the revenue should go toward transportation projects.
Mr. Christie and Democrat leaders in the Legislature have called for voters to approve dedicating the money for the state's transit needs, but Kim Guadagno, Mr. Christie's chosen lieutenant governor, publicly disagreed with him, citing the prospect of more debt.
Connecticut
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, is likely to be re-elected in Connecticut, which has little electoral drama this year. Mr. Blumenthal is opposed by Republican Dan Carter, a state representative, who has viciously attacked him. Mr. Blumenthal is far ahead in the polls and fundraising.

New York City Ramps Up Security for Election Day; Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump plan to hold events in Manhattan Tuesday night,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836809548?accountid=12768,"The New York Police Department will deploy thousands of officers to protect the city on Election Day as voters go to the polls amid heightened political tensions and threats of a terrorist attack.
""They're going to see a lot of police, they're going to see a lot of uniforms, they're going to see a lot of marked cars,"" Police Commissioner James O'Neill said Monday. ""New Yorkers should feel good about [Tuesday], that they're going to be in safe hands.""
NYPD officials said they were on high alert after receiving information about a possible al Qaeda attack aimed at disrupting the presidential election. The threat lacked specificity, officials said. Over the weekend, Islamic State called for attacks on the U.S. on Election Day, officials said.
In a show of confidence Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Mr. O'Neill appeared together alongside NYPD and Secret Service officials in Times Square. They said the city was accustomed to dealing with large events and was prepared to deal with possible terrorism, protests or voter intimidation.
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump are both slated to hold election-night events in Manhattan. Mrs. Clinton's event is scheduled to be at the Javits Center on the far West Side, and Mr. Trump's event is at the New York Hilton Midtown on Sixth Avenue.
""We have an obligation not only to the people of this city but to this country to make sure that tomorrow all through the day and particularly tomorrow night goes smoothly,"" said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat. ""New York City will never be intimidated.""
NYPD officials said some 5,000 officers would be out on the streets Tuesday, a force that will include heavy-weapons teams, counterterrorism units, bomb-sniffing dogs and hundreds of plainclothes officers looking for suspicious activity. They also said officers will be posted at polling sites and would respond to any possible incidents of voter suppression.
Officials said New Yorkers can expect security measures to feel similar to those taken on New Year's Eve. John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence, called the approach ""an all-out posture"" that has become ""part of the new normal for New York City.""
Police officials said they had taken extra security measures because both major candidates were expected to be in New York City on Tuesday night.
The city will see extensive traffic closures. Beginning Tuesday morning, 34th Street will be closed, as well as 11th Avenue between 34th and 40th streets. The area surrounding Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue will be closed while Mr. Trump is in the building, as will the area surrounding the Hilton.
Mr. O'Neill said keeping the city safe was a shared responsibility.
""If anyone sees something tomorrow that doesn't look right, doesn't feel right, let one of our officers know about it,"" he said. ""Or call 911.""

Will Obama's Cuba Policy Lose Florida for Clinton? Exiles who oppose normalization could give Trump the state's 29 electoral votes.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836701100?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are in a statistical dead heat in Florida, where the state's 29 electoral votes will be pivotal in Tuesday's presidential election. One surprise for Democrats is that President Obama's December 2014 decision to liberalize U.S. Cuba policy is not helping their nominee as the White House expected it to. Instead, it has become a liability.
Mr. Obama and Democrats bet big on the hypothesis that the traditional hard-line approach to dealing with the Castro regime, which encouraged the Cuban diaspora of the 1960s, '70s and '80s, is passe. And that new generations of Cuban-Americans, either U.S. born or more-recently arrived, favor economic and political engagement with the regime.
By spinning the president's more-liberal travel policy to the island as an opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of Cuban change, the administration also hoped to gin up enthusiasm in Miami for his kinder, gentler attitude toward the communist military dictatorship. Mr. Obama's detente with Cuba was supposed to be a political winner.
Just 23 months later that theory is being tested.
Cuban-Americans who initially supported Mr. Obama's outreach are increasingly disillusioned with an administration strategy that helps the Castros but leaves out the Cuban people. This could affect turnout among left-of-center voters who care about human rights.
The Obama policy also seems to be energizing greater numbers of conservative and independent Cuban-Americans to rally behind the Republican candidate. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll released on Oct. 30 had the New York real-estate developer leading Mrs. Clinton 52% to 42% among Cuban-Americans. Some read this as a result of recent Trump efforts in south Florida to make himself a champion of Cuban exiles. But it is more likely a rise in the protest vote.
The U.S. trade embargo, which dates to 1962, was codified into U.S. law in 1996. Lifting it requires congressional approval. But Mr. Obama has normalized relations with Havana, a step aimed at lending legitimacy to the gangster government. He also has used an executive order to liberalize U.S. travel to Cuba and has licensed some U.S. hotels to operate on the island.
The administration's public explanation for the change was that economic engagement with Cuba would hasten the fall of the dictatorship.
A less charitable reading of Mr. Obama's motivations suggests that he harbors ideological sympathy for the Cuban Revolution and believes that the Castros would treat Cubans humanely if only the U.S. would demonstrate tolerance for tropical totalitarianism.
Regardless of which narrative you prefer, the president badly miscalculated. Even his supporters have noticed.
A July 1 column in the Miami Herald by Cuban-born Fabiola Santiago, who described herself as having been a supporter ""of the president's policy of engagement with the goal of improving the lives of the Cuban people,"" captured the disillusionment. Ms. Santiago was particularly peeved about the opening of the Four Points Sheraton Havana, ""brought to you, American traveler, by the people who repress Cubans.""
The columnist explained that the Obama opening was sold as a path that would allow American companies to partner in joint ventures with Cuban entrepreneurs. Instead, she wrote, referring to Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which owns Sheraton, ""the American hospitality giant is in business with the Cuban military, which owns the hotel."" As she observed, that changes nothing. ""We're only shifting from the Castro brothers and family personally enriching themselves through totalitarian rule to the repressive military now doing exactly the same thing.""
Ms. Santiago quoted the similar sentiments of Richard Blanco, the Cuban-American poet who was tapped to read at the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Havana in August 2015: ""How will [the goal of bringing prosperity to the Cuban people] be realized if basically they are doing what other foreign investors have done, namely, strike a deal with the government that leaves the ordinary Cubans in the same situation? How is this any better, simply because it's the U.S.?""
If this is how supporters are assessing Mr. Obama's Cuba project, it's not hard to picture Cuban-Americans who either took a wait-and-see approach, or oppose the Obama policy, viewing this election as a chance to vote against it in order to aid their Cuban brethren. By pledging to stick with the policy, Mrs. Clinton has made herself a target.
The Cuban economy is in tatters and the regime is backtracking on promises of reform. Human-rights groups say that beatings and detentions of dissidents have soared since the U.S. extended the olive branch. Yet Mr. Obama keeps making concessions to the Castros, as he did on Oct. 14 when he authorized further sanctions relief.
No matter who wins on Tuesday, the next president will have to clean up this Cuba mess. Decent Cuban-Americans on both sides of the aisle want answers.

Oil Prices Rise on Hopes of Output Accord; Expectations Hillary Clinton can secure the U.S. presidency also supports prices,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836600021?accountid=12768,"Oil prices were up along with the broader market Monday, after the FBI said it had not found new evidence to warrant charges against presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and amid renewed hope that the world's major oil producers will come to an agreement regarding production cuts.
U.S. crude futures rose 82 cents, or 1.86%, to $44.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 57 cents, or 1.25%, to $46.15 a barrel.
Analysts said oil was also benefiting from increased appetite for risky assets amid growing confidence that Hillary Clinton could prevail over Donald Trump in Tuesday's presidential election. Equity markets have
also rallied as investors interpreted the FBI's announcement as favorable to Mrs. Clinton's chances and removing a key element of uncertainty.
""The stock market likes it, and the oil market likes it as well,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group.
But strength in the U.S. dollar limited oil's rise. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against other currencies, rose 0.53% Monday. A stronger dollar can make oil, which is traded in dollars, more expensive for buyers using foreign currencies.
Also bolstering oil markets Monday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reaffirmed its commitment to cutting output. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said Monday that the cartel remains committed to the tentative accord the group reached in Algiers in September, and that Russia remains on board with the plan to limit output.
The statements followed reports of disagreements between OPEC members that stoked fears that the continuing talks about production cuts won't lead to a deal at the group's meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30. Both crude benchmarks lost about 10% last week on growing skepticism about a deal and a record 14.4-million-barrel rise in U.S. oil stocks.
""Now the whispers sound like there is going to be a deal,"" said Chip Hodge, senior managing director at John Hancock Financial Services. ""There's a lot of talk, and until we actually see an agreement, speculation moves things up or down.""
Analysts said the market may have been too hasty to write off the prospects for a deal.
""OPEC often reaches agreements in a fairly noisy way and, like many organizations, it rarely reaches a definitive deal before a deadline,"" Standard Chartered analyst Paul Horsnell wrote in a client note.
Gasoline prices fell to their lowest price since late September, after the Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel conduit to the East Coast, restarted Sunday, less than a week after a fatal explosion and fire. Many analysts had initially expected the outage to last longer and gasoline futures surged following the incident, but reversed those gains throughout last week. Gasoline futures settled down 0.76 cents, or 0.55%, to $1.371 a gallon. Diesel futures rose 1.03 cents, or 0.27%, to $1.4406 a gallon.

"Whoever Wins, Capitalism Will Survive; Don't despair. Trump or Clinton may be a dismal choice. But the U.S. economy is resilient.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836486212?accountid=12768,"As Americans prepare to make what many see as a depressing choice between presidential candidates, they shouldn't despair. Yes, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton don't sound like wise stewards of economic policy. And yes, we have some problems that need serious attention, such as a badly distorted credit market and an unworkable Affordable Care Act. But the American capitalist economy has become extremely powerful and can most likely withstand further abuse, however unwelcome.
It was not always thus. In the 1930s, a much smaller, heavily agrarian American economy was in danger of falling victim to statism. The ""Great Depression"" began in 1929 with a downturn in the business-credit cycle that precipitated a stock-market crash. The market was recovering in 1930 but the real economy didn't rebound as it had after a similar crash in 1920.
New Deal historians called what happened a ""crisis of capitalism."" In fact, capitalism was doing great in the 1920s. Henry Ford was cranking out Model Ts that almost anyone could afford. Housewives were buying labor-saving tools like electric vacuums and washing machines on the installment plan. Fat Sears and Montgomery Ward catalogs offered the bounty of capitalism to dwellers in even the remotest farm houses.
It was public policy that deepened an ordinary recession and prolonged it for a decade. The Depression was a demonstration of what happens when the government responds to a downturn with excessive interference with market forces.
The seeds of the Depression were planted with the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, in a two-year interval in which President Woodrow Wilson had a compliant Democratic Congress. The act set up 12 regional government banks to make preferential loans to farmers. Farmers had done well earlier, so much so that years later they would ask the government to support prices on a parity with the year 1912. But the 1916 government venture damaged country banks with unfair competition and encouraged farmers to overproduce. That lowered prices.
Calvin Coolidge fended off their demands for relief from low prices but Herbert Hoover refinanced the FFLA, suggesting that he was an easier mark than Coolidge. After the 1929 crash, farmers again pressured the Republican Congress for relief, prompting Sen. Reed Smoot of Utah and Rep. Willis C. Hawley of Oregon to draft a bill raising tariffs on farm products. Had Congress stopped there the damage would have been limited. But lobbyists for industry and labor demanded protection as well. The final Smoot-Hawley bill doubled already-high tariffs on 20,000 dutiable items to an average of 50% of value.
Ignoring his own better instincts and a petition signed by more than 1,000 economists, Hoover signed Smoot-Hawley into law. The sharp drop-off in trade that resulted sent prices plummeting, worsening what was already a deflationary cycle caused by the loss of liquidity in the crash. Europeans were inhibited from selling goods in the U.S. to earn dollars to buy U.S. products and pay their war debts. The reduced flow of funds worsened deflation. Europe's retaliation with tariff increases made matters worse. A global money shortage ensued.
U.S. exports nose-dived to $1.7 billion in 1933 from $5.2 billion in 1929, with farmers--big exporters even then--hit the hardest. Democrats swept the 1932 elections but instead of giving the country less market interference they gave it more.
The most egregious was the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, which required businesses to adopt 557 ""codes"" to prevent price cutting. These cartels violated the key principle that market competition is the guarantor of a vigorous, efficient economy. The NIRA veered the U.S. close to European-style fascism, which had many admirers at that time. Fortunately, the Supreme Court put it out of its misery in 1935, declaring it an unconstitutional extension of government power.
Despite Smoot-Hawley, the New Deal's revolutionary farm production quotas, the NIRA and FDR's attacks on capitalism, the business cycle turned upward in 1933. Unemployment fell from nearly a quarter of the labor force that year to 17% in 1936. But then the ""second New Deal"" Congress slapped a tax on ""surplus"" business profits, the equivalent of a tax on job-creating investment. The market crashed again in 1937 and took the economy with it.
In 1940 FDR, to his credit, realized that to rearm a militarily weak America he badly needed the capitalists he had spurned and often reviled. He made peace with them and they responded magnificently, especially after Japan's December 1941 attack, quickly mobilizing their factories to perform amazing feats of weapons production.
That performance, plus the defeat and discrediting of fascists Hitler and Mussolini and the outset of the Cold War with ultra-statist Stalin gave Americans a new appreciation for market capitalism. Largely unfettered in the postwar era, privately owned corporations produced the technological marvels and high living standards we enjoy today.
The system is under threat again. But it is far stronger now than it was in the 1930s. History is not on the side of the statists.
Cheer up, if you can.

Election 2016: Clinton's College Plan Takes Backseat on Trail,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811263734?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton, who prides herself on the details of public policy, has said little about what is now the most ambitious and expensive proposal on her agenda: making public college tuition free for most Americans.
On the campaign trail, she typically offers a sentence, maybe two, about the plan. Sometimes it goes unmentioned altogether. Her campaign has offered few specifics about how the program would work, hasn't said how much money states would have to provide or where the program would fall on her list of priorities.
The campaign website no longer lists a cost for the program, though campaign aides said they estimate it would take $500 billion in new federal spending over 10 years, $150 billion more than the college plan she put out last summer. Others estimate the costs would be much higher.
The sketchiness may owe something to the way the free-tuition plan came to be part of Mrs. Clinton's platform. Rather than taking months or years to craft, like many of her other proposals, it was inserted as part of negotiations in July to win the backing of Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, who tracks higher education and other issues at the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, said it was obvious that the plan was put together to win over Mr. Sanders.
Most of Mrs. Clinton's policy proposals ""are five pages of dense text with very specific ways of how they're going to pay for it and how much it would cost,"" she said. ""This sounded much more like something intended to energize a campaign rally.""
The Clinton plan still is more detailed than most of the ideas put forth by her opponent, Republican Donald Trump, who doesn't typically give the cost of his plans and sometimes changes significant planks. Still, Mrs. Clinton prides herself on her policy chops and says candidates owe it to voters to be clear about their plans. Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mrs. Clinton says she would pay for the college plan with higher taxes on the wealthy, including new limits on deductions. Campaign aides said that once school is back in session and younger voters are paying more attention, she would talk more about the college plan.
Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said Mrs. Clinton is ""deeply committed"" to the revised plan. ""Hillary Clinton put forward an ambitious proposal in the primary and, after listening to voters on the campaign trail, expanded it to more effectively reach the goal of erasing the barrier of debt to a college of education,"" he said.
Passing this program into law will be a challenge, though, particularly if Republicans continue to control at least one house of Congress. Even some Democrats think Mrs. Clinton's first proposal would have a better chance and worry that the revised version is too heavy a lift.
The new Clinton policy was described in a single paragraph issued by the campaign in early July amid talks with Mr. Sanders, who had campaigned against her in the primary on a more expansive free-tuition plan. His concept was that public colleges should be free for all, like public high schools.
Mrs. Clinton had already put forth a detailed plan last summer to assure that students could attend public colleges without borrowing money for tuition, but she said families should contribute what they could afford. To win over Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton agreed that students in families earning $85,000 a year or less would be assured free tuition, with that threshold climbing to $125,000 over four years.
The political goals were clear. The policy was a priority for Mr. Sanders, and after her shift, he endorsed her. She also put herself in position to appeal to younger voters, who overwhelmingly backed Mr. Sanders in the primaries and are an important part of the coalition that twice elected President Barack Obama.
In his speech at July's Democratic convention endorsing Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders specifically cited this policy shift.
Mrs. Clinton had long described her plan, which she calls the New College Compact, as a balanced way of making sure all players have ""skin in the game,"" including federal and state governments, universities, families and students.
Under her new plan, 80% of families would qualify for tuition-free school, even if they could afford some contribution. A Clinton aide noted that students are still expected to have a job that will help pay expenses, and said that it is most important that government pay its fair share.

Clinton Abandons The Middle On Education,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811263685?accountid=12768,"Throughout this campaign season, Democrats have feigned confusion about why disaffected Republicans have not embraced Hillary Clinton, given Donald Trump's character defects. But the K-12 education plank in the Democratic Party platform does a lot to explain the hesitance. The party's promises seem designed to satisfy teachers unions rather than to appeal to ordinary Democrats, much less opposition moderates.
Democrats say that they will ""recognize and honor all the professionals who work in public schools,"" including ""teachers, education support professionals, and specialized staff,"" suggesting that every teacher does a terrific job. The party also promises that it will ""end the test-and-punish version of accountability."" Only charter schools seem to need more scrutiny: The platform includes a full paragraph of ideas to regulate them.
Democrats nationwide seem to have a different view. Like Republicans, Democrats have a positive view of most teachers, but their confidence does not extend to all of them. Democrats and Republicans both think that nearly 60% of teachers in their local schools are either excellent or good, and another quarter at least satisfactory. But Democrats find up to 15% of teachers unsatisfactory. It doesn't seem like rank-and-file Democrats are ready to honor all teachers and simply trust them.
These are some of the data Education Next reveals in a survey to be published next week. Over the course of May and June our publication surveyed 700 teachers and 3,500 other Americans. The results demonstrate how out of touch the Democratic Party has become on education.
In contrast with platform-committee Democrats, 80% of rank-and-file adherents who took a position on the issue said they backed the federal requirement that ""all students be tested in math and reading each year,"" with only 20% disagreeing. Republicans had similar responses: 74% and 26%, respectively.
As for punishing and rewarding teachers, 57% of Democrats nationwide said they supported ""basing part of the salaries of teachers on how much their students learn."" Fifty-nine percent said teacher tenure should be eliminated.
For their platform, party insiders voted to ""support enabling parents to opt their children out of standardized tests."" But Democrats nationwide do not share this view. When asked whether they favored ""letting parents decide whether to have their children take state math and reading tests,"" 71% of Democrats said they did not. So did 69% of Republicans.
Democrats in Philadelphia also suggested that they ""will end the school-to-prison pipeline by opposing discipline policies which disproportionately affect African-Americans and Latinos."" But 61% of Democrats around the country oppose federal policies that ""prevent schools from expelling and suspending black and Hispanic students at higher rates than other students."" So do 86% of Republicans, and a majority of both African-American and Hispanic respondents who take a side.
Democratic honchos qualify their support for charter schools by asserting that they ""should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools"" -- not a good sign since it is impossible for charters to enroll more students without contraction elsewhere. But when Democrats nationwide were asked whether they supported ""the formation of charter schools,"" 58% of those with a position said yes, as did 74% of Republicans.
It isn't clear who wrote these lines in the Democratic Party platform. But teachers unions have for years battled testing, accountability and merit pay. They push parental ""opt out"" as a backdoor way to kill testing, and the unions are doing their best to prevent charter schools from expanding. On discipline policies, the support is coming from civil-rights groups and the Obama administration.
If the views of rank-and-file Democrats don't count, and party leaders care little about the political center, it's hard to see how Mrs. Clinton could turn victory into a governing majority.

"Silicon Valley Investor Peter Thiel Wins Bet on Trump; Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, was early supporter while many in Silicon Valley endorsed Hillary Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837347342?accountid=12768,"Peter Thiel, one of the tech industry's shrewdest investors, won the longest-shot bet of his career Tuesday when Donald Trump clinched a stunning and unexpected victory .
Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc. and early backer of Facebook Inc., endorsed Mr. Trump in a speech at the Republican National Convention in July and donated $1.25 million to the GOP candidate's campaign in its darkest hour. The donation came a week after a video surfaced in which Mr. Trump bragged of groping women and as other women came forward to accuse Mr. Trump of sexually assaulting them.
The Silicon Valley iconoclast backed the New York real-estate developer as nearly every other tech industry leader, including some lifelong Republicans, endorsed Hillary Clinton and denounced Mr. Trump as unfit to be president.
A staunch Libertarian, Mr. Thiel identified the undercurrent of economic distress that political pundits failed to appreciate but that exit polls showed drove so many voters to the polls.
""Where I work in Silicon Valley, people are doing just great,"" Mr. Thiel said in a speech at the National Press Club on Oct. 31. ""Most Americans haven't been part of that prosperity. It shouldn't be surprising to see people vote for Bernie Sanders or for Donald Trump, who's the only outsider left in the race.""
Mr. Trump wasn't Mr. Thiel's first choice among Republican presidential candidates. He had pumped $2 million into the campaign of former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina during the primary season. In the two prior presidential elections, Mr. Thiel backed Republican former Texas Rep. Ron Paul.
Late Tuesday night, Mr. Thiel issued a statement congratulating the president-elect. ""He has an awesomely difficult task, since it is long past time for us to face up to our country's problems,"" Mr. Thiel said. ""We're going to need all hands on deck.""
After PayPal, Mr. Thiel co-founded big-data software firm Palantir Technologies Inc., which sports a multibillion-dollar valuation. He also started venture-capital firm Founders Fund, which made smart bets on Airbnb Inc., Space Exploration Technologies Inc. and Spotify Inc., among other companies.
""Peter is very shrewd and very smart,"" said Max Levchin, a friend of Mr. Thiel and fellow co-founder of PayPal. ""He bets contrarian not when he knows he'll win, but when he knows that his odds of winning are much better than most people think.""
Earlier this year, Mr. Thiel won another victory when Hulk Hogan prevailed in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against Gawker Media for publishing a sex tape of the pro wrestler. Mr. Thiel had donated $10 million to support the suit. Gawker was forced into bankruptcy after losing the suit, which brought accusations that Mr. Thiel was attacking press freedoms.
""This is not about the First Amendment, it is about the most egregious violation of privacy imaginable,"" Mr. Thiel said of his support for the Gawker suit in October.
Some have wondered if Mr. Thiel was angling for an appointment in a Trump administration. In his book, ""Zero to One,"" Mr. Thiel wrote that his dream had once been to be a Supreme Court clerk, leading some to speculate if he might be appointed to the court itself. His name wasn't among a list of 20 potential nominees to the court that Mr. Trump released.
In his talk at the National Press Club, Mr. Thiel outlined his view of the nation's problems, bemoaning the U.S. military's involvement in conflicts abroad, America's high trade deficit and an overzealous regulatory environment that he said harms small businesses.
""Very unusually for a presidential candidate, [Mr. Trump] has questioned the core concept of American exceptionalism,"" Mr. Thiel said at the time. ""He doesn't think the force of optimism alone can change reality without hard work.""
Mr. Thiel sought to distance himself from Mr. Trump's more abrasive comments, faulting the media for failing to take Mr. Trump's candidacy seriously.
The media ""never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally,"" said Mr. Thiel at the National Press Club. ""I think a lot of the voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously, but not literally.""
When Mr. Trump speaks of building a wall on the Mexican border, Mr. Thiel said, ""what [voters] hear is we're going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy.""
Mr. Thiel supports some fringe causes, like technology he hopes will drastically increase human lifespans as well as the Seasteading Institute, which aims to create ocean-based cities outside the reach of governments. He called his bet on Mr. Trump more ""conventional,"" considering half the country supported the candidate, which is why Mr. Thiel said he was surprised by the controversy it kicked up.
Describing the presidential campaign, Mr. Thiel said it was ""between one candidate who says everything is more or less fine, or it's as good as it can be. And then another one who says we're on the Titanic, it's about to sink. And so I prefer the second one.""

This is the first time Maine has split its electoral votes since it began its proportional system in 1972. Maine is one of two states that don't award all Electoral College votes to the winner.
Mr. Trump won one of Maine's congressional districts, which gives him one of the state's four electoral votes. Mrs. Clinton won the state's other congressional district and the two additional electoral votes the state awards the statewide majority winner, giving her a total of three electoral votes.
The large population of white working-class voters likely helped Mr. Trump secure the vote. The working-class population voted for President Barack Obama in 2012.

Donald Trump Wins Utah; Holds back challenge from Hillary Clinton and independent candidate Evan McMullin,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837155451?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump prevailed in Utah on Tuesday, overcoming ambivalence about the GOP nominee from many Mormons, who make up the majority of the state's population.
With 36% of the votes tallied, Mr. Trump won 51% of the state--defeating Hillary Clinton, and Evan McMullin an independent candidate who ran on a conservatism platform. The Associated Press called the race for Mr. Trump.
Mr. McMullin came in second, with 23.5% of the vote. Mrs. Clinton garnered 20%.
Mr. McMullin, a Mormon and former House Republican staffer, made Utah an unlikely swing state , with polls in late October showing him running close with--or even ahead of--Mr. Trump.
Republican elected officials in Utah, including Gov. Gary Herbert and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, also distanced themselves from Mr. Trump in October, though Mr. Chaffetz later backtracked and said he would vote for the GOP nominee.
Many Utah voters ultimately did the same, despite their reservations about his character.
Rebecca Farnsworth, a 52-year-old resident of Sandy, Utah and a Mormon, said Mr. Trump was ""not a very upstanding guy. He's not honest. He's kind of a playboy.""
Still, she voted for him. ""I thought he'd appoint Supreme Court justices--that was my only reason,"" she said. ""I knew a vote for a third party was basically a vote for Hillary Clinton, so I tossed that idea out the window. I wanted to be smart.""
Speaking to supporters on election night, Mr. McMullin called on his voters to help build ""a new conservative movement.""
If Mr. Trump wins the election, Mr. McMullin said in his concession speech, ""the Republican Party can no longer be considered the home for conservatives.""
Conservatism, he said, was about protecting ""fundamental rights,"" adding, ""tonight there are millions of Americans, I'm sad to say, who are in fear that perhaps their liberties will be challenged and threatened under a Trump administration that has made a campaign of targeting people based on their race, their religion and gender.""
Gov. Gary Herbert, who coasted to re-election on Tuesday, said in a phone interview Tuesday night that he wasn't surprised Mr. Trump had carried the state, though he would likely win a far lower portion of the vote than Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, who carried more than 70% of the Utah vote.
""I think it's because of his policies, in spite of the personal foibles and lack of some decency and character that really is a turnoff for the people of Utah,"" Gov. Herbert said. ""The policy side of what you will do in the Oval Office lines up a lot better with Utah. That carried the day.""

Election 2016: Suburbanites Aid Clinton in Pennsylvania,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811735285?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Donald Trump has energized the plentiful working-class, white voters in Pennsylvania, but Hillary Clinton's lead among African-Americans here and her growing hold on suburban voters have suddenly made Republican hopes of winning this battleground look more remote.
Mrs. Clinton's lead in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls had narrowed to less than a single percentage point in June, but it has now grown to nearly 10 points. A top super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA, on Monday said it was suspending its ads in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado, citing Mrs. Clinton's lead in the polls in those states.
David Plouffe, who orchestrated President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, said a Trump victory in Pennsylvania would now depend on ""historically catastrophic"" turnout among Democrats and ""astronomical"" performance from Republicans. ""It's not going to happen,"" he said in an interview.
Trump campaign officials still views Pennsylvania as competitive, telling lawmakers Tuesday that the state is one of five where they plan to start airing TV ads. David Urban, a senior adviser for Trump's campaign in Pennsylvania, contends that Mr. Trump's message of political change will resonate in the state.
On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton came here seeking to cement her support among African-American voters, a central part of her coalition. Speaking at an event in a predominantly black West Philadelphia neighborhood, she urged her supporters not to be complacent. ""Even though we're doing fine right now, I'm not taking anybody, anywhere for granted,"" she said.
Mr. Trump had support from a mere 1% of Pennsylvania's African-American voters in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll earlier this month, with Mrs. Clinton taking 94%. Mrs. Clinton's lead was wider than the 93%-to-7% margin won in the 2012 election by President Barack Obama.
For Mrs. Clinton, like other Democrats, the key to winning Pennsylvania is to run up big margins in and around Philadelphia, home to many minority voters. In 2012, Mr. Obama topped his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, by nearly 500,000 votes in Philadelphia alone, putting him on track for a 300,000-vote, or 5-percentage-point, victory in the state.
Republican's point to Mr. Trump's strength among the state's large bloc of white voters without a four-year college degree, one way of defining working-class whites, as the key to putting the state in the GOP column for the first time since 1988.
In the Journal/NBC/Marist survey, Mr. Trump had a 16-point lead among those voters, compared with a slightly narrower 14-point margin that exit polls showed Mr. Romney winning in Pennsylvania in 2012.
Rob Gleason, the state Republican Party chairman, said he expected Mr. Trump to perform well in the western part of the state, far from Philadelphia, and in other places where working-class voters have been buffeted by the decline of manufacturing. While Mr. Trump draws more support from working-class white voters than did Mr. Romney, he's drawing far fewer college-educated white voters. Many of those voters live in the Philadelphia suburbs, where Mrs. Clinton had built a lead of 52% to 26% over Mr. Trump in the poll.
Mr. Trump said at a recent campaign stop that cheating or fraud was the only way he would lose Pennsylvania. His campaign is recruiting ""election observers"" in swing states to help monitor the polls for any problems.

Election 2016: FBI Turns Over Clinton Probe Material --- Grassley calls for release of documents where possible; agency opposes move,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811735253?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday gave Congress a written summary of interviews with Hillary Clinton and some of her key aides, a move likely to further fuel political fights over her much-criticized use of private email to do government business.
In response, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) said much of the information should be released publicly to shed more light on the investigation that has dogged Mrs. Clinton as she pursued and won the Democratic nomination for president.
""The FBI should make as much of the material available as possible,"" Mr. Grassley said in a statement. ""The public's business ought to be public, with few exceptions. The people's interest would be served in seeing the documents that are unclassified.""
Mr. Grassley said the FBI sent interview summaries and supporting materials. He added that much of the material isn't classified but is marked for official use only.
According to a person familiar with the matter, the unclassified portions of the FBI's material weren't heavily redacted, with the exception of some names. However, some material that cited Central Intelligence Agency interests was redacted entirely and provided only to the congressional intelligence committees.
In addition to the interview summaries, the FBI also provided lawmakers on several congressional committees with copies of the 110 emails found on Mrs. Clinton's server that contained classified information, though those emails had previously been provided to some members of Congress.
The FBI in July announced it had concluded its investigation of Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct government business as secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey said that while they found careless behavior they found no reason to charge anyone with a crime.
Republicans, who have long criticized Mrs. Clinton over the email practices, have questioned the FBI's conclusions and demanded to see more details from its case file.
In a rare moment of agreement, the Clinton campaign also argued for the public release of much of the material so that voters can judge the materials for themselves.
""This is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the FBI,"" a Clinton campaign spokesman said. ""We believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.""
The FBI, however, in a statement urged that the material not be made public or leaked by the lawmakers and congressional aides who are reviewing it.
""The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence,"" the FBI said.
Mrs. Clinton has said she made a mistake in using a private email server but said she never sent or received any information that was marked classified.

"Election 2016: Clinton and Kaine Release Taxes --- Democrat, trying to press rival Trump, reveals income decline in campaign run-up",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811729748?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's 2015 tax return showed a sharp drop in income as she launched her presidential campaign, along with a higher federal effective income-tax rate than any president since Gerald Ford, a sign of caution for a candidate facing intense scrutiny over her family's finances.
The return showed Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton made $10.6 million in adjusted gross income last year, largely from speaking fees, books, and Mr. Clinton's consulting activities.
The Clinton campaign used Friday's disclosures to pressure Donald Trump for refusing to release his tax returns. He has said he won't do so until an audit has been completed, which could make him the first major-party presidential candidate since 1976 to release no returns.
The Clintons paid an effective federal income-tax rate of 34% in 2015. Their income was down from $28 million in 2014, when they paid an effective tax rate of more than 35%. According to Internal Revenue Service data for 2013 returns, the most recent available, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $10 million and above paid an average of 26% in total federal income tax.
The latest return showed the Clintons gave more than $1 million, or nearly 10% of their gross income, to charity.
Almost all of those donations went to the Clinton Family Foundation, a fund established in 2001 that serves as the vehicle for the couple's charitable giving and is different from the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit whose activities have been scrutinized. The family foundation made donations worth $3.8 million in 2014, $1.8 million in 2013 and $1 million in 2012.
Around half of the giving in 2014 went to the Clinton Foundation, with the rest split between 63 groups that included universities, medical centers, museums and other nonprofits. The Clinton Foundation received around one-quarter of gifts from the smaller family foundation in 2012 and 2013.
Joseph Thorndike, a tax historian at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publisher, said Mrs. Clinton in the latest year had a higher tax rate than any sitting president since Mr. Ford, whose average rate was nearly 38% during his presidency. The lowest average rate belonged to George H.W. Bush, who paid just under 20%.
""It's striking that for a rich person, her tax return is very boring,"" said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that specializes in tax issues, who was a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration. ""She certainly could afford to pay people to help her figure out ways to avoid paying more in taxes.""
Mrs. Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.), released 10 years of his returns. Mr. Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, paid an effective rate of 20% last year on $313,000 in adjusted gross income.
Their rate ranged from as low as 13% in 2009, when they had nearly $180,000 in adjusted gross income during Mr. Kaine's last full year as governor of Virginia, to 24% in 2011, when they reported $256,000 in adjusted gross income.
They donated 6.8% of their adjusted gross income to charity last year and 7.5% over the past 10 years. According to IRS data for 2013 tax returns, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of between $200,000 and $500,000 paid an average of nearly 20% in total federal income tax. Mrs. Clinton had previously posted online her returns back to 2007. She and her husband have released returns dating to 1977.
In a statement, the Trump campaign called the release of Mrs. Clinton's taxes a ""distraction and misdirection"" from other controversies that have dogged the former secretary of state, including her use of a private email server while she was in government as well as her office's contacts with the Clinton Foundation.
Mr. Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, also hasn't released his tax returns.

Trump and Clinton Will Go Down in History -- For a While,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811049747?accountid=12768,"Somewhere in America, just after 2 o'clock on a steamy summer afternoon, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were out making their rounds, seeking to become a permanent part of the nation's history. On East William Street in Delaware, Ohio, I was the only person in front of the BP gas station, looking toward a small patch of dirt and sparse foliage.
Near the gas pumps, a Bud Light delivery truck had just parked. Its driver, on foot, noisily wheeled some silver-colored kegs of beer past where I stood. Traffic on William Street was fairly heavy, but as far as I could tell not a single motorist glanced over toward the object that had caught my eye.
""Very few people even realize it's here,"" the owner of the gas station, Jean Khanjian, told me. ""I don't think it has any effect on our business, either way.""
What I was looking at was a weathered plaque declaring that the spot where the pumps stand ($2.05 a gallon on this Midwestern day) was the birthplace of Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States. It has been almost a hundred years since the house where his mother gave birth to him -- his father had died during her pregnancy -- was torn down.
All the frenzied striving by a different crop of candidates every four years for the enduring eminence that comes with the presidency, all the time and hope put into overcoming the odds that will keep all but one from making it to the White House -- all of it, as we're seeing this summer, is so perpetually present-tense and seemingly urgent. And yet . . .
The Upper Cut barber shop was next door, a pizza place called Amato's diagonally across the street. There was a black rubber hose snaked around the base of the plaque, which has been here since 1926 through a succession of different gas-station proprietors. No water emerged from the mouth of the hose, and some of the dirt had cracked in the heat.
Only 400 or so people lived in Delaware in 1822, when the baby was born to his just-widowed mother. Hayes is not a president about whom many people give much thought these days. He served a single term, from 1877 to 1881, preceded by Ulysses S. Grant and succeeded by James A. Garfield. But still, when a president comes from a small town, you might think his birthplace would be commemorated in grander fashion.
""Indeed,"" the head of the Delaware County Historical Society, Brent Carson, told me when I sought him out. ""It's not really befitting of a president of the United States. There's not even a place on the street for a car to park so a driver can get out."" Is there any presidential birthplace in the U.S. marked as modestly as this one at the gas station? ""I can't imagine,"" Mr. Carson said.
The cable newscasts on this afternoon were wall-to-wall with reports about Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton and their parallel quests to become the 45th president. One day the place where one of them was born will become a draw for sightseers, part of the immortality that automatically accompanies victory.
""We're proud that a president was born here,"" said R. Thomas Homan, the city manager of Delaware. ""But is that gas station a destination for tourists? I would have to say no.""
Not that the town is indifferent. Last year a committee was set up to devise a more proper tribute to President Hayes. The chairman of the committee was an 18-year-old senior at Rutherford B. Hayes High School, Cory Beam, who told me that he gave up playing varsity baseball this spring -- he was a starting pitcher -- to work on the project.
""The plaque's not even legible anymore,"" he said. ""You can hardly read it. People walk by like it's not even there. That's not the way a president from your town should be remembered.""
Mr. Beam -- he's leaving Delaware to go to college this fall -- and his committee recently presented a plan to the city's leaders. If funding can be found, a statue of Rutherford B. Hayes would be erected in a plaza that would be designed nearby, with a fountain and a place for visitors to sit. Although the plaza would not be on the precise site where Hayes was born, the statue's eyes would be looking directly at the BP station where the house once stood.
On this afternoon a woman gassed up her gray Toyota Camry. With a dog in her back seat she turned left onto William Street. She accelerated first past the plaque and then past St. Mark's Lutheran Church, and there is, in the end, an unexpected sort of grandeur to this place. It is the indisputable affirmation of an American truth. The old promise is real:
From a spot like this one, all the way to the White House. You can get there from here.

""Confirmed that I am on the Kremlin's sanction lists and cannot travel to Russia,"" Mr. McFaul said in a tweet. Mr. McFaul served as the U.S. envoy to Moscow between 2012 and 2014, where he was a democratic adviser on Russian policy to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state.
In another tweet, Mr. McFaul said his ""close affiliation with [President Barack] Obama"" was behind the travel restriction.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs wouldn't immediately comment on the issue.
Russia warmly welcomed Donald Trump's win in the presidential election earlier this week, with President Vladimir Putin saying he hoped relations between the two countries would now be restored . U.S.-Russian relations have deteriorated over the crises in Ukraine and Syria .
Mr. Trump's democratic rival Mrs. Clinton was widely viewed with mistrust and suspicion by the Russian political leadership.
After Mr. Trump's victory Wednesday, Mr. McFaul wrote on Twitter: ""Putin intervened in our elections and succeeded "" and added, in the Russian language, ""well done."" The tweet was later erased.
Responding to the tweet, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Obama administration has a habit of appointing people who try manage other countries besides their own. ""And when there is a stalemate they begin to cry that Moscow is to blame,"" Ms. Zakharova wrote on her public Facebook page.
Mr. McFaul, who is currently director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, has a decades-old relationship with Russia. ""Hope that I am not on the Russia travel ban list forever,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Since 1983, I've been living in and traveling to that country.""

Election 2016: Clinton Is Ordered to Respond to Email Suit,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812591719?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday ordered Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to submit written testimony to questions from a conservative legal group in response to a lawsuit over email records from her time as secretary of state.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan said Judicial Watch could submit questions to Mrs. Clinton about her reasons for using a personal email server for government business.
Judge Sullivan denied the group's request to question Mrs. Clinton in person under oath, ruling that it didn't demonstrate that was necessary and sparing Mrs. Clinton a potentially embarrassing deposition as the presidential campaign gears up.
""Secretary Clinton has unique firsthand knowledge of the purpose for the creation and operation of the clintonemail.com system for State Department business,"" Judge Sullivan wrote in his opinion.
But, he added, ""Judicial Watch has failed to demonstrate that it cannot obtain the discovery it seeks through other, less burdensome or intrusive means.""
Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server run out of her home has been a source of controversy since it was revealed last year. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey called her decision ""extremely careless."" An internal State Department investigation concluded that she violated standard practices and policies.
Mrs. Clinton has described her use of her own server as a mistake, but the issue has continued to come up since she became a presidential candidate.
""Judicial Watch is a right-wing organization that has been attacking the Clintons since the 1990s. This is just another lawsuit intended to try to hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign,"" Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said after the ruling. ""We are glad that the judge has accepted our offer to answer these questions in writing rather than grant Judicial Watch's request.""
Mrs. Clinton's attorneys opposed having her testify, writing in a briefing last month: ""Judicial Watch claims that it needs to depose Secretary Clinton, a former cabinet secretary, about six purportedly unanswered questions. The record, however, already answers those questions or makes clear that Secretary Clinton has no personal knowledge to provide.""
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said, ""We are pleased that this federal court ordered Hillary Clinton to provide written answers under oath to some key questions about her email scandal."" The lawsuit relates to State Department records. Mrs. Clinton isn't named as a defendant.

Election 2016: Clinton Faces Health-Law Pressures,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812385299?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Aetna Inc.'s decision to scale back participation in the Affordable Care Act's exchanges puts new pressure on Hillary Clinton over health care, a onetime signature issue that has taken a back seat in her presidential campaign.
The pressure is coming from the left and the right.
Liberals say the Aetna decision shows the need for a government-run option to compete with private insurance companies, or even for a single-payer, Medicare-for-all program, as Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed again this week.
""The provision of health care cannot continue to be dependent upon the whims and market projections of large private insurance companies whose only goal is to make as much profit as possible,"" Mr. Sanders said in a statement.
The message to Mrs. Clinton, an aide to the Vermont senator said, was that he would continue to pressure her on the issue if she is elected president.
Democrats have tried to move past the debate over the Affordable Care Act, a goal made harder this week when Aetna said it would withdraw from 11 of the 15 state health-care exchanges, unsettling the marketplaces and reducing consumer options.
Mrs. Clinton since 2007 has backed what is known as a public option, in which a government-run health insurance agency would compete with private health plans. She reaffirmed her support during her Democratic primary against Mr. Sanders. He and others on the left, concerned that she might tack to the center if elected president, will be pushing to make sure she carries through.
Conservatives say Aetna's decision shows the law isn't working and should be scrapped.
""Aetna just today announced that they are dropping out, as are many of the major insurance agencies. Obamacare is a disaster,"" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said at a rally Tuesday in Wisconsin.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly predicted that big premium increases are likely this fall, a related issue that also is problematic for the health-insurance exchanges. The GOP nominee says the jumps will be ""election changing"" and has accused the Obama administration of plotting to delay the announcement of the increases until after the elections.
""Premiums are going up at a rate that nobody has ever seen before,"" he said last week in Virginia. He predicted the fall boosts would be ""catastrophic . . . an increase like never before.""
At the start of the primary season, Mrs. Clinton outlined a suite of proposals aimed at addressing the high costs of health care, including new limits on out-of-pocket expenses. But she said little about the structure or future of the health law itself.
""She was hoping we had just moved beyond a fight on the ACA,"" said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a longtime Clinton policy adviser.
In their primary contest, Mr. Sanders aggressively challenged Mrs. Clinton on health care, saying a ""Medicare-for-all"" single-payer plan was the only way to guarantee universal coverage.
In February, the Clinton campaign quietly added to her website a statement supporting a public option. She hardly mentioned the matter until July, when she reaffirmed her position after talks to win Mr. Sanders's endorsement.
Clinton advisers say her support for the idea is genuine. In an economic speech last week, she promised to ""defend and improve"" the health law, including ""giving Americans, in every state, a choice of a public option health insurance plan that will help everybody afford coverage.""
""It will strengthen competition, and drive down costs,"" she said.
Aides say Mrs. Clinton's hope is that if elected, she could work with Republicans in Congress to improve the law.
Chris Jennings, an outside adviser to the campaign, cited ideas aimed at increasing enrollment as areas where she hopes to work with the GOP. ""People on all sides of this issue need to ratchet back the politics in health care and reflect where we used to be,"" he said, with the parties working together.
Such talk about cooperation with Republicans only fuels suspicion on the left that she will abandon pursuit of policies such as the public option.
""I think her instincts are more moderate than they like to claim -- more centrist, more establishment,"" said Bob Borosage, co-director of the liberal group Campaign for America's Future. He said he is hopeful, though: ""In her coalition, the energy is more on the left.""

Election 2016: Clinton Broadband Plan Is Questioned,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814538947?accountid=12768,"On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton sketches a vision where every home in the U.S. has a high-speed internet connection.
In just four years, children in inner cities and rural areas alike will be able to access the internet to do their homework, Mrs. Clinton tells voters. And entrepreneurs everywhere in the country will be able to go online to sell their products or start new businesses.
The cost? She doesn't say, but the former secretary of state urges a bold push to quickly close the digital divide.
""I happen to think we should be ambitious,"" Mrs. Clinton said earlier this month. ""Let's connect every household in America to broadband by the year 2020.""
Experts say the proposal is ambitious -- and expensive. Some question whether her timeline is realistic.
""I would be pleasantly surprised if the country could actually attain Secretary Clinton's goalin four years,"" said Sharon Strover, director of the Technology and Information Policy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. But she is dubious. ""Too many things have to fall into place.""
Beyond the price tag, it is unclear which part of the government would execute the plan and whether Republicans in Congress would back bills needed to deliver on the promise -- a challenge Mrs. Clinton couldn't overcome when she pushed similar initiatives as a New York senator.
Sara Solow, domestic policy adviser for the Clinton campaign, said the initiative has a good shot at drawing bipartisan support in today's digital age. ""Universal broadband connections and really good fiber-optic networks are more and more perceived as something that is essential for the 21st century economy, and there are such economic payoffs to it,"" she said.
Mrs. Clinton's initiative would be part of broader infrastructure legislation she has said she would push Congress to act on within the first 100 days of her administration.
A study would be needed to determine the cost of the broadband plan, where coverage gaps remain and which agency should take the lead, a senior Clinton aide said.
Bradley Tusk, CEO of the tech regulatory and political firm Tusk Ventures, called Mrs. Clinton's plan to upgrade the country's digital infrastructure ""pretty uninspired and general,"" deeming it a ""very analog tech plan in a very digital world.""
Mr. Tusk, who supports Mrs. Clinton's candidacy and has donated to her campaign, said the proposal lacks bold ideas and creative thinking about different ways to provide internet access to hard-to-reach areas.
""The government is not going to become a giant telecom provider, and even if they were, they would not meet this 2020 deadline,"" he said.
The federal government has played a role in bringing high-speed internet to more parts of the country. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included $6.9 billion to deploy broadband infrastructure and expand access in rural areas.
Five years later, the president's Council of Economic Advisers reported that 110,000 miles of broadband infrastructure had been added or improved, and 20,000 community institutions had gained access to high-speed connections.
If Mrs. Clinton is elected, one of the first steps she would take would be to examine federal broadband programs that were implemented under President Barack Obama and then build on efforts that have proved successful, said the senior campaign aide.
Ms. Strover, of the University of Texas, said Mrs. Clinton could struggle to deliver on her promise because the people who still lack broadband live in areas that will prove costly and logistically difficult to connect.
The Federal Communications Commission estimated this year that 10% of Americans lack access to what it considers quality broadband. The shortfall is 39% in rural areas, it said.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump hasn't laid out a plan for expanding broadband access. Trump campaign officials didn't respond to requests for comment.

Foundation Tapped Clinton Friend,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814573381?accountid=12768,"When the Clinton Foundation in 2014 was seeking a firm to manage its planned $250 million endowment, it turned to a familiar source: a New York investment fund with a managing director, Nicole Fox, who is a longtime friend of Chelsea Clinton and served as matron of honor at Ms. Clinton's wedding.
Ms. Fox, along with the chief executive of Summit Rock Advisors L.P., presented to the foundation during the hiring process, said Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian.
Ms. Fox's husband, Michael Fox, also was until recently chief administrative officer and deputy chief operating officer of Eaglevale Partners, the hedge fund co-founded by Ms. Clinton's husband, Marc Mezvinsky.
Mr. Minassian said the foundation selected Summit Rock from among a dozen other managers because it was deemed to be ""one of the most respected firms helping not-for-profit organizations such as colleges and charities invest their endowments.""
""Once it became clear that Summit Rock was one of the finalists, Chelsea did not participate in the final selection process,"" he added in a statement.
Summit Rock and Mr. and Ms. Fox declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Ms. Clinton declined to comment.
Nonprofit ethics specialists said that hiring a firm that includes personal ties is legal, but that it creates an appearance that decisions are being made to favor friends, not what is best for the charity.
""It would have been wise for anybody who would be connected with the [Clinton] family either professionally or personally to have been recused,"" said Doug White, the former director of Columbia University's graduate fundraising management program who now advises nonprofit groups.
He added that the Clinton Foundation, as a globally renowned charitable organization, wouldn't have had a scarcity of options in selecting an investment firm.
Ray Madoff, director of the Forum on Philanthropy and the Public Good at Boston College Law School, said that while the optics of the foundation's selection might not be great, the practice is common. ""I think that this is par for the course,"" Ms. Madoff said. ""Wealthy people do business with people they trust -- who are quite commonly friends.""
Politico reported in 2015 that Summit Rock's Ms. Fox was a classmate of Ms. Clinton at Sidwell Friends School, and Ms. Fox interned in the Clinton White House.
The questions about the foundation's choice of a manager for its endowment come as the organization has faced accusations of creating conflicts of interest for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state.
Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has ramped up his criticism of the foundation, accusing the Clintons of running a ""pay for play"" operation that granted to donors political access at the State Department.
While the foundation had moved in recent days to outline steps it would take to reduce any possible conflicts of interest for Mrs. Clinton if she is elected president, the organization said this week that Chelsea Clinton would remain on the board, in part to help oversee the foundation's transition as it seeks to spin off various programs to partners.
Mrs. Clinton, in an interview with MSNBC on Friday, said that if she is elected, the foundation would take additional steps to avoid potential conflicts. ""We're going to do everything we can to make sure that good work continues, and that's going to take some time,"" she said.
Summit Rock manages $10.735 billion in 100 accounts, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and was co-founded by Nancy Donohue, former vice president for external management at Harvard Management Co., the university's investment fund.
Both Ms. Donohue and Ms. Fox have donated the maximum $2,700 for the primary to Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
The Clinton Foundation hasn't disclosed what rate it is paying the investment firm. Dean Zerbe, national managing director of tax firm Alliantgroup and former senior counsel on the Senate Finance Committee's Republican staff, said the foundation should disclose the rate, which he said should be well under 1%.
Mr. Minassian didn't address a question about that issue in his statement. A Summit Rock Advisors brochure states, ""Summit Rock typically charges clients an advisory fee equal to 0.50% per year."" If that is the rate charged to the foundation, it would mean Summit Rock would earn $1 million a year from handling the Clinton Foundation's endowment.
President Bill Clinton, who founded the foundation after leaving office in 2001, told supporters in a Monday letterthat he would resign from the board, stop raising money, and that the organization would institute a ban on corporate and foreign donations.
At the same time, however, the foundation began to carve out exceptions to that plan. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, the foundation's largest project, is considering accepting foreign government and corporate funding.
After Mrs. Clinton left the State Department in 2013, the Clintons embarked on a fundraising spree that brought in $200 million for the foundation's endowment by June 2014. The goal, in part: To preserve the foundation's financial stability in the future, even without the Clintons' fundraising prowess.
Now, more than a year into Mrs. Clinton's campaign, the foundation has collected another $50 million in donations and pledges for that endowment, an official said.
Including the endowment, the foundation has raised as much as $2 billion, mostly from corporations, wealthy donors, governments and other foundations.
Its aim is to form partnerships between governments, companies and other nonprofits to tackle projects that focus mostly on climate change, economic development, global health and opportunities for women and girls.

Election 2016: Court Order Adds Pressure on Clinton Email Release,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814282551?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- A Florida court order issued Thursday increases the likelihood that material contained in recently discovered emails from Hillary Clinton's time at the State Department will be released before Election Day.
While most of the Clinton-email litigation has unfolded in multiple Washington, D.C., courtrooms, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch also has been pressing a Freedom of Information Act case in a south Florida federal court. That case seeks access to communications between then-Secretary of State Clinton and the White House during the time of the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation during its probe of Mrs. Clinton's private email use found 14,900 emails that hadn't been disclosed previously. The FBI earlier in August finished transmitting those documents to the State Department, which is currently sorting through them while attempting to navigate deadlines set by several judges.
The Florida court order, from U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas, said the State Department, if it discovers relevant materials from the Benghazi time frame, should produce records eligible for public release by Sept. 13.
In a similar case in Washington, the department had proposed to begin producing any Benghazi-related documents on Sept. 30. Judicial Watch has pointed to an Aug. 23 status report filed by the State Department in that case as suggesting the new emails might include Benghazi materials.
The State Department, however, said it is still reviewing what might be contained in the documents.
""Using broad search terms, we have identified a number of documents potentially responsive to a Benghazi-related request. At this time, we have not confirmed that the documents are, in fact, responsive. We also have not determined if they involve Secretary Clinton,"" said State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau.
The various Judicial Watch cases stem from Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server during her State Department tenure, an issue that continues to hang over the Democratic nominee's presidential campaign.
The Clinton campaign has dismissed litigation brought by Judicial Watch, calling it ""a right-wing organization that has been attacking the Clintons since the 1990s.""
In another case where Judicial Watch is seeking a broad array of Clinton email records, a different Washington, D.C., judge this week ordered the State Department to review the newly discovered emails quickly to determine which ones can be released.
U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has set another hearing for Sept. 23, indicating he will then set a schedule for the production of documents.
There are exceptions under the records law that allow government agencies to withhold release of certain sensitive or personal information, so some of the new material could be exempt from release.

"Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: In Clinton vs. Trump, Who Is Inspired to Vote?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814843423?accountid=12768,"Political debate has become so nasty, and everyone has become so numb to the nastiness, that it's easy to overlook this reality: Last Thursday may have been the most negative day in modern presidential campaign history.
The two major party nominees for president -- not their surrogates, or their TV ads, but the candidates themselves -- leveled the most searing of personal attacks on each other.
Republican Donald Trump charged that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ""lies and she smears"" and said her actions ""constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise."" Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump ""has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia"" and that ""his disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.""
And it's only August.
Aside from what this exchange says about the level of public discourse, it also raises a more practical question: Is this the sort of campaign that's actually going to inspire people to turn out and vote?
The answer will be crucial in determining the outcome -- and, like everything else in this campaign, may run counter to conventional wisdom.
It once was thought that negative campaigns depressed voter turnout. People were turned off by a nasty tone, tuned out the race and found something better to do on Election Day. If that is the case, we should be headed for record low turnout this year.
Yet evidence in recent years calls that conventional wisdom into doubt. And it may have to be thrown out the window entirely in 2016.
""Fear and hatred are the strongest emotions in politics,"" says Charlie Cook, a veteran nonpartisan political analyst. ""There's a feeling the stakes are very, very high. People who aren't normally engaged in politics are fascinated.""
The emotion that tends to suppress turnout is apathy, Mr. Cook notes, and apathy arises from a belief that there's no real difference between the candidates. ""I haven't heard that this year,"" he said. As a result, he predicts ""average to high"" levels of turnout.
If nothing else, this year's campaign will test the question of how motivated voters can be to vote against a candidate rather than for one.
That's because dissatisfaction with the two main candidates is at historic levels. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 37% of Democrats said they would have preferred that somebody other than Mrs. Clinton become the Democratic nominee, and a resounding 52% of Republicans said they would have preferred somebody other than Mr. Trump.
More than six in 10 reported negative feelings toward Mr. Trump personally; more than five in 10 had negative feelings toward Mrs. Clinton personally.
Those certainly are numbers suggesting the desire to stop one of the candidates will be as high as the desire to actually elect one of them.
But in the end, will that be enough to get people to the polls? The early evidence is mixed. When the Journal/NBC News poll asked people in July to rate their interest in this year's campaign, 60% said their interest was at the highest level; that was down slightly from the same point in each of the last three presidential cycles.
Moreover, so many voters answering the Journal/NBC poll volunteered that they had decided not to vote for either major presidential candidate -- not that they were undecided, but rather that they had made a conscious decision not to vote for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton -- that such a response was added as its own data point. In early August, 8% offered this ""neither"" response.
Some of those folks may be headed toward either Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson or Green Party candidate Jill Stein; add them to the mix and they together attract 15% of the vote right now.
That suggests a lot of turned-off voters. Yet turnout actually was high during this year's primary-election season, which was held amid a climate of negativity similar to the one prevailing now. More than 57.6 million people, 28.5% of estimated eligible voters, cast ballots in presidential primaries this year, the Pew Research Center reports, a turnout just below the record level of 2008.
All this makes it hard to predict who will and who won't be inspired to vote. Evidence suggests Mrs. Clinton has a hard core of support of just over 40% of the electorate, and Mr. Trump has a hard core of support of something under 40% of the electorate.
That leaves perhaps 20% of the electorate that is persuadable. Right now, it may be too much to hope they find a candidate to be for. Whether being against one of them proves motivation enough to show up is one of the keys to the 2016 campaign.

Election 2016: Clinton's Cash Lead Grew in July,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812831766?accountid=12768,"Heading into the final months of the presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton has amassed far more financial firepower than her Republican rival, Donald Trump.
Mrs. Clinton's campaign raised $63 million in July, on top of $26 million for two joint funds with the Democratic Party and nearly $10 million raised by her friendly super PAC, according to new Federal Election Commission filings. Between her campaign, joint accounts and outside groups, Mrs. Clinton and her allies ended the month with $140 million in the bank.
In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign raised $36 million in July, in addition to $44 million raised for his joint funds with the Republican National Committee. His super PACs raised about $4 million in July. His campaign, joint funds and allied outside groups had $78 million on hand at the end of July.
Mr. Trump has lagged substantially behind Mrs. Clinton in polls, and if he doesn't start to look more competitive by Labor Day, Republican donors and party leaders are expected to increasingly steer their time and resources toward preserving GOP majorities in the House and Senate.
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign more than doubled its spending in July, paying out $18.4 million -- up from $7.8 million in June. Yet none of that spending went to TV ads, which are typically where presidential candidates direct most of their funds at this stage in the election.
Mrs. Clinton has spent $61 million on TV ads in the last two months.
Mr. Trump began airing his first TV ads of the general election over the weekend, spending $4.8 million to broadcast ads in four states.
Mr. Trump also didn't substantially increase his spending on staff and field organization efforts, two areas where his operation has lagged behind Mrs. Clinton's. He continued to spend more on hats and other campaign merchandise -- $1.8 million in July -- than on building out his campaign.
Mr. Trump's latest FEC filing shows that his campaign dramatically escalated spending on consultants in July, paying consulting firms at least $10 million last month, up from $1.5 million in June.
The biggest beneficiary was a San Antonio-based web-marketing firm, Giles Parscale, that the campaign paid $8.3 million for ""digital consulting/online advertising."" Brad Parscale, the firm's president, serves as the Trump campaign's digital director. He doesn't draw a separate paycheck, according to the filing.
In June, the campaign paid that firm $543,000. The firm, which before 2016 had never worked for a presidential campaign, collected more than $4.1 million from the Trump campaign through June, much of it for ""website development.""

Clinton's Punitive 'Exit Tax',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812831391?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are having a tax debate of sorts, with the Democrat wheeling out the familiar class-warfare artillery. Mr. Trump hasn't replied on the specifics, but the irony is that his reform would solve the problem that Mrs. Clinton claims to be angry about -- namely, the wave of American companies fleeing for foreign tax climes.
""Corporations should not abandon profitable operations here in the United States to move abroad, just to give shareholders a quicker return, CEOs a bigger bonus and unions a weaker hand to play,"" Mrs. Clinton said in her Michigan economic speech on Aug. 11.
Mrs. Clinton is targeting so-called inversions, where U.S.-based companies move their headquarters by buying an overseas competitor, as well as foreign takeovers of U.S. firms for tax considerations. These migrations are the result of a U.S. corporate-tax code that supplies incentives to migrate -- and Mrs. Clinton wants to enact even more restrictions and penalties than President Obama already has.
The Democrat would impose what she calls an ""exit tax"" on businesses that relocate outside the U.S., which is the sort of thing banana republics impose when their economies sour. She'd conduct a census and then categorize any multinational with more than 50% U.S. ownership as a domestic concern that would be subject to a tax on its deferred profits if it inverts. She isn't specifying the punitive tax rate.
Unlike most countries, the U.S. taxes residents -- businesses and individuals -- on their world-wide income, not merely the income that they earned in the U.S. But tax law allows them to defer taxes on overseas profits until they bring the money back to invest at home.
U.S.-based companies have about $2 trillion parked in foreign subsidiaries. Mrs. Clinton wants to change the rules retroactively to take a government cut from this overseas cash pile. Mr. Trump may want to build a wall to prevent immigrants from coming to America, but Mrs. Clinton wants to build a tax wall to stop Americans from escaping. ""If they want to go,"" she threatened in Michigan, ""they're going to have to pay to go.""
By the way, Mrs. Clinton says she'll use the proceeds of the exit tax to fund what she calls the greatest ""investment"" in roads, bridges and airports since World War II. But she also says the exit tax will deter inversions, which means it wouldn't raise much money. Which is it?
Mr. Trump's plan -- when he bothers to mention it -- recognizes the real problem, which is that the U.S. taxes companies headquartered in the U.S. far more than companies based in other countries. Thirty-one of the 34 OECD countries have cut corporate taxes since 2000, leaving the U.S. with the highest rate in the industrialized world.
The U.S. system of world-wide taxation means that a company that moves from Dublin, Ohio, to Dublin, Ireland, will pay a rate that is less than a third of America's. A dollar of profit earned on the Emerald Isle by an Irish-based company becomes 87.5 cents after taxes, which it can then invest in Ireland or the U.S. or somewhere else. But if the company stays in Ohio and makes the same buck in Ireland, the after-tax return drops to 65 cents or less if the money is invested in America.
Mr. Trump proposes to cut the U.S. corporate rate to 15% from 35% (or 40% counting average state rates). Fifteen percent is low enough to deter inversions while making the country more attractive to capital investment and better primed for higher wages. He would also offer a preferential rate of 10% for the $2 trillion already earned overseas.
Mrs. Clinton calls this tax-cutting for billionaires and corporate-jet owners, which shows how unhappy her Presidency could be. Such Trumpian pragmatism -- 10% of $2 trillion is better than 35% of $0 -- is the only realistic way for Mrs. Clinton to fund her infrastructure plan, and Republicans in Congress have sounded out Democrats for such a deal for years. President Obama has rebuffed their entreaties, settling for nothing -- and now Mrs. Clinton is setting herself up for the same.
As for Mr. Trump, he could be pointing out that his corporate-tax plan would raise worker incomes, as most economic research suggests. And why not challenge Mrs. Clinton for supporting a status quo that is driving jobs and investment overseas? And maybe even benefiting China, Mexico and Japan?
After nearly a decade of Obama-Clinton economics, the country needs a debate about how to revive growth and raise incomes. The corporate-tax proposals show that whatever Mr. Trump's risks as President, the main risk from Mrs. Clinton is four more years of the same dismal economic performance.

Team Clinton's Pathetic Excuses,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815618825?accountid=12768,"The emergence of nearly 15,000 more deleted emails and evidence of shady dealings by her family's foundation have put Hillary Clinton back on the defensive. That's a bad place to be as the presidential campaign kicks into high gear on Labor Day.
Team Clinton is offering excuses and misdirection, hoping the press tires of the controversies and that Donald Trump creates more of his own. But the unconvincing explanations being offered create more problems than they solve, raise more questions than they answer, and bring Mrs. Clinton's credibility to a nearly total collapse.
First are the denials that anything is amiss. On Aug. 21, CNN's Dana Bash asked Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, if giving special treatment to Clinton Foundation donors was ""the kind of back-scratching that has Americans just turned off."" Mr. Mook demurred: ""There was no quid pro quo or anything like that."" But there was.
Questioned the same day by CBS's John Dickerson about the private email account, Mr. Mook claimed that ""Secretary Clinton wasn't the first person to do this."" But she was. No other secretary of state had a private server, refused to use the department's secure system, and then destroyed thousands of emails.
Mr. Mook also suggested on CBS that the rules governing such things were ""very murky."" But they weren't. The rules were clear: No State Department official should use personal email for official business, let alone set up a private server.
Mr. Mook's comment goes to Mrs. Clinton's intent. If she had felt that the rules were murky, she should have asked the State Department's Office of the Legal Adviser to clarify, but apparently she didn't. However, if her goal was to avoid disclosing her emails, then the last people she would have asked to weigh in would be the department's impartial lawyers.
This is important now that the FBI plans to release the summary of its interrogation of Mrs. Clinton. Americans may soon find out whether she sought legal advice -- and from whom -- before carrying out her email scheme.
On CNN, Mr. Mook dismissed the continuing controversy as ""another example of a right-wing group just trying to keep this, the questions coming and keep this issue alive."" But distinctly not-conservative outlets in the mainstream press have provided extensive coverage.
For instance, the AP reported last week that of the 154 nongovernmental persons who had meetings or phone calls scheduled with Secretary Clinton in the first half of her tenure, at least 85 were Clinton Foundation donors. Clintonistas complained that the AP's report ignored her meetings with government officials. But that she met with plenty of diplomats and bureaucrats is irrelevant; that most of her meetings with people outside of government involved donors to her family foundation is prima facie evidence of special treatment.
Team Clinton also suggested that the ends justify the means. Mr. Mook told CBS that ""the Clinton Foundation does incredible charitable work."" Longtime Clinton factotum James Carville argued on MSNBC that the foundation saves lives, denouncing attacks on it in religious terms: ""Somebody is going to hell over this.""
It is a desperate argument to keep a slush fund running. Other charities -- say, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- could easily assume the Clinton Foundation's humanitarian activities and do them better, without the stench of corruption.
Mr. Mook made his most ludicrous claim by telling CBS that on ethics rules Mrs. Clinton and the foundation ""have actually gone above and beyond."" But they haven't. Jonathan Swan of the Hill reports that the Clinton Foundation didn't live up to pledges made when Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state to disclose all donors and submit prospective foreign donations for State Department review. It also didn't report millions in speaking fees that the Clintons channeled to the foundation, or reveal the sources of donations funneled through a Canadian charity.
This despite the warning of then-Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) at Mrs. Clinton's 2009 confirmation hearing: ""The Clinton Foundation exists as a temptation for any foreign entity or government that believes it could curry favor through a donation."" That's why no other secretary of state or president has had such a huge, multipurpose foundation operating while in office.
At that same hearing, John Kerry, then the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, confidently predicted that Mrs. Clinton had ""articulated a sensitivity to this which is going to have to be judged by the practice."" Now the results are in: On Wednesday the ABC/Washington Post poll found Mrs. Clinton's unfavorable rating had risen to 59%, only one point less than Donald Trump's.
For good reason, too: If she didn't keep her word to the Senate about avoiding conflicts of interest, why should Americans accept what she says now about doing so in the future?

Election 2016: Clinton Slams Rival on Foreign Policy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815605791?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton offered a withering attack on Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy on a day when he met privately with Mexico's president, casting her Republican presidential rival as a figure who could jeopardize U.S. alliances and national security.
In an address to the American Legion's national convention in Cincinnati, the Democratic nominee defended the notion of American ""exceptionalism"" while suggesting Mr. Trump offers a more dour view of the country's standing in the world. She seized on a comment made by Mr. Trump in a Republican debate early this year that the U.S. military was ""a disaster.""
""I completely reject anyone, including my opponent, who calls the American military, and I quote, 'a disaster,' ""Mrs. Clinton said. ""That is an insult to the men and women serving today and all who have served before in putting their lives on the line.""
Mrs. Clinton's remarks on Wednesday were overshadowed by Mr. Trump -- this time by his meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Still, she sought to use the Cincinnati appearance to capitalize on what her campaign believes is a political strength: her credentials as a former secretary of state. She spoke about her efforts to build international coalitions, shore up alliances and advise the president on such fateful decisions as the special-forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
""Getting countries working together was my job every day as secretary of state,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""It takes consistency and reliability.""
In a response, the Trump campaign released a statement from Matt Miller, director of Veterans for Trump, saying: ""Hillary Clinton has shown she is fundamentally unequipped to further the national security interests of the United States and stand up for our veterans.""
The statement mentioned her use of a private email account at the State Department, which resulted in classified material circulating outside the official government computer systems.

Democrats Push Clintons To End Foundation Ties,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815275730?accountid=12768,"Corrections & Amplifications
William Galston is an opinion columnist for The Wall Street Journal, a Clinton campaign donor and a scholar at the Brookings Institution, and he worked in the White House during Bill Clinton's presidency. A Page One article on Wednesday about the future of the Clinton family's ties to the Clinton Foundation neglected to note his connection to the Journal.
(WSJ Sept. 1, 2016)
The Clinton family is being pressed by some party officials and donors to sever all ties to the Clinton Foundation should Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton win the presidential election.
Former President Bill Clinton last week described a series of steps that included ending foreign and corporate donations to the foundation and his stepping down from the board -- while preserving a role for daughter Chelsea Clinton.
Yet, even some allies are arguing that those moves wouldn't go far enough to prevent an appearance of undue influence by the charity's donors.
""The foundation has become a distraction, politically speaking,"" Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.) said in an interview. ""Cut the ties to the family. What's at stake is the big prize. The big prize is not the Clinton Foundation. It's the presidency of the United States.""
William Galston, a donor who worked in the Bill Clinton White House and is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said the ""most prudent course would be to begin her presidency with a clear line of separation between the Clinton family and the foundation. This would not be an easy decision, but in my judgment it would be best for her administration and for the country.""
Some Democrats say the remedies put forward thus far by the foundation amount to half-measures that are doing little to dampen the controversy. They want to see more definitive steps than current plans, which call for winding down programs on an uncertain timetable, keeping daughter Chelsea Clinton on the board and continuing to accept donations from U.S. individuals. All this opens Mrs. Clinton to charges that the foundation would pose a potential conflict of interest during her presidency, these Democrats say.
While some gave their views on the record, other Democrats who are close to the Clinton family and campaign spokeon condition of anonymity.
One concern is that Mrs. Clinton would repeatedly be pushed on the defensive as president, with her appointments to official posts and invitations to state dinners constantly scrutinized for ties to the foundation.
""I absolutely think that any relationship between the president, her husband and daughter needs to be absolutely severed,"" said John Maa, a San Francisco surgeon who serves on the Democratic National Committee's national finance panel. ""It would be an absolute conflict of interest for it to remain under the leadership of her family.""
Questions about the foundation have been a drag on Mrs. Clinton's campaign, fueling voter perceptions that she isn't straightforward in her dealings. In recent weeks she has faced a drumbeat of reports about foundation donors and officials seeking access to the State Department when she served as the nation's top diplomat.
Mrs. Clinton's rival Donald Trump, a businessman with far-flung interests, would also face potential conflicts of interest should he win. That hasn't stopped him from raising questions about the former secretary of state. ""Access and favors were sold for cash,"" Mr. Trump said in a speech last week.
Records show Mrs. Clinton met with foundation donors when she was secretary of state but there is no proof her actions were influenced by their interests.
A difference that Democrats highlight is that Mr. Trump's potential conflicts involve for-profit businesses -- not a charitable foundation. He has said he would place his adult children in charge of his business dealings should he win, an arrangement questioned by ethics experts.
A Trump spokesman repeated that the GOP nominee plans to keep his business dealings in the family. ""Mr. Trump has pledged to completely hand off his responsibilities to his children so they can run his businesses completely independent of his control,"" he said.
Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said the foundation has agreed to restrictions on its mission and financing over time. Policies when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state went ""far beyond legal requirements,"" he said, and the limits were made more rigorous when she launched her campaign.
On Tuesday, foundation officials offered more detail about how they intend to proceed if Mrs. Clinton is elected. They said all international programs would be spun off, while ""limited"" domestic initiatives such as work promoting early childhood education may continue.
Donna Shalala, foundation president, said if Mrs. Clinton wins, ""we'll work quickly through the end of the year and into 2017 to transition our programs. We intend to transition them as soon as possible, but as people in the global development space understand, the timeline needs to be driven by what's best for the people who depend on our programs for help, not by politics.""
A spokesman for Chelsea Clinton said she wants to remain on the board to oversee the implementation of the new fundraising restrictions and the transition of the foundation's work to other entities. But some Democrats argue stricter steps are needed should her mother ascend to the White House.
Brady Quirk-Garvan, chairman of the Charleston County, S.C., Democrats, said the Clinton foundation has done ""amazing work"" and he hopes it will continue, but separated from Mrs. Clinton and her immediate family, including her daughter. ""I think not having any immediate family on the board would seem the prudent thing to do,"" he said.
Relinquishing a role in the foundation isn't easy for the Clinton family, people close to them say. The family often cites the foundation's charitable work reducing the cost of prescription drugs and easing poverty in Third World countries.
After Mr. Clinton left the White House in 2001, the foundation offered a vehicle for continued involvement in world affairs and societal causes. It also provided him a marquee stage for his policy and philanthropic interests and, over time, it has become central to Mr. Clinton's postpresidential legacy.
Eric Bauman, chairman of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party, said Mr. Clinton is right to leave the foundation board, but he sees no problem with Chelsea Clinton maintaining her post.
""He is [Hillary's] spouse and will be living in the White House. Their daughter will not be living in the White House,"" said Mr. Bauman. ""What gets so lost is the work that has been done and the fact that thousands and thousands of people are alive and have benefited by the work done by the Clinton Foundation.""

The U.S. Department of Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814057909?accountid=12768,"This is the week that the steady drip, drip, drip of details about Hillary Clinton's server turned into a waterfall. This is the week that we finally learned why Mrs. Clinton used a private communications setup, and what it hid. This is the week, in short, that we found out that the infamous server was designed to hide that Mrs. Clinton for three years served as the U.S. Secretary of the Clinton Foundation.
In March this column argued that while Mrs. Clinton's mishandling of classified information was important, it missed the bigger point. The Democratic nominee obviously didn't set up her server with the express purpose of exposing national secrets -- that was incidental. She set up the server to keep secret the details of the Clintons' private life -- a life built around an elaborate and sweeping money-raising and self-promoting entity known as the Clinton Foundation.
Had Secretary Clinton kept the foundation at arm's length while in office -- as obvious ethical standards would have dictated -- there would never have been any need for a private server, or even private email. The vast majority of her electronic communications would have related to her job at the State Department, with maybe that occasional yoga schedule. And those Freedom of Information Act officers would have had little difficulty -- when later going through a state.gov email -- screening out the clearly ""personal"" before making her records public. This is how it works for everybody else.
Mrs. Clinton's problem -- as we now know from this week's release of emails from Huma Abedin's private Clinton-server account -- was that there was no divide between public and private. Mrs. Clinton's State Department and her family foundation were one seamless entity -- employing the same people, comparing schedules, mixing foundation donors with State supplicants. This is why she maintained a secret server, and why she deleted 15,000 emails that should have been turned over to the government.
Most of the focus on this week's Abedin emails has centered on the disturbing examples of Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band negotiating State favors for foundation donors. But equally instructive in the 725 pages released by Judicial Watch is the frequency and banality of most of the email interaction. Mr. Band asks if Hillary's doing this conference, or having that meeting, and when she's going to Brazil. Ms. Abedin responds that she's working on it, or will get this or that answer. These aren't the emails of mere casual acquaintances; they don't even bother with salutations or signoffs. These are the emails of two people engaged in the same purpose -- serving the State-Clinton Foundation nexus.
The other undernoted but important revelation is that the media has been looking in the wrong place. The focus is on Mrs. Clinton's missing emails, and no doubt those 15,000 FBI-recovered texts contain nuggets. Then again, Mrs. Clinton was a busy woman, and most of the details of her daily State/foundation life would have been handled by trusted aides. This is why they, too, had private email. Top marks to Judicial Watch for pursuing Ms. Abedin's file from the start. A new urgency needs to go into seeing similar emails of former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills.
Mostly, we learned this week that Mrs. Clinton's foundation issue goes far beyond the ""appearance"" of a conflict of interest. This is straight-up pay to play. When Mr. Band sends an email demanding a Hillary meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain and notes that he's a ""good friend of ours,"" what Mr. Band means is that the crown prince had contributed millions to a Clinton Global Initiative scholarship program, and therefore has bought face time. It doesn't get more clear-cut, folks.
That's highlighted by the Associated Press's extraordinary finding this week that of the 154 outside people Mrs. Clinton met with in the first years of her tenure, more than half were Clinton Foundation donors. Clinton apologists, like Vox's Matthew Yglesias, are claiming that statistic is overblown, because the 154 doesn't include thousands of meetings held with foreign diplomats and U.S. officials.
Nice try. As the nation's top diplomat, Mrs. Clinton was obliged to meet with diplomats and officials -- not with others. Only a blessed few outsiders scored meetings with the harried secretary of state and, surprise, most of the blessed were Clinton Foundation donors.
Mrs. Clinton's only whisper of grace is that it remains (as it always does in potential cases of corruption) hard to connect the dots. There are ""quids"" (foundation donations) and ""quos"" (Bahrain arms deals) all over the place, but no precise evidence of ""pros."" Count on the Clinton menagerie to dwell in that sliver of a refuge.
But does it even matter? What we discovered this week is that one of the nation's top officials created a private server that housed proof that she continued a secret, ongoing entwinement with her family foundation -- despite ethics agreements -- and that she destroyed public records. If that alone doesn't disqualify her for the presidency, it's hard to know what would.

Trump Faces Narrow Path --- GOP nominee likely must sweep four key states where he now trails Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813587498?accountid=12768,"As the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the fall presidential race approaches, Republican Donald Trump faces an increasingly narrow path to the White House.
A Trump victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton likely would require a sweep of a set of battleground states where he is competitive but trailing in recent opinion polls -- Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- and both campaigns describe them as the heart of the race. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, could win with just one of them, partly because Democrats start with a larger number of states that historically side with them.
Both campaigns have put their money and their time in those states, despite suggestions they might turn elsewhere. Mr. Trump has traveled to those states more than others and has paid advertising in only these four states. Of the 20 media markets that have received the greatest number of ad spots placed by either the Clinton campaign or its main super PAC, 16 are in one of them, according to an ad tracker not affiliated with either campaign.
""It just becomes very hard and difficult to understand how the Trump campaign gets to 270"" Electoral College votes needed to win, said Russ Schriefer, a strategist for Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign. Compared with that election, ""the map has shifted and is much more favorable to the Democrats.""
Mr. Trump still has about 11 weeks to Election Day, and races tend to tighten toward the end. There is also enough time for unexpected revelations to alter the campaign's trajectory. But polls show Mrs. Clinton has momentum.
Both her campaign and Priorities USA, a super PAC backing her, have pulled ads from Colorado and Virginia. They were battlegrounds in the last two campaigns, having voted Republican as recently as 2004 and in most elections in the decades prior.
But demographic changes favor the Democrats, and polling shows Mrs. Clinton with solid leads in both states.
If Mrs. Clinton carries those states and wins Pennsylvania, she could withstand losses in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and many other swing states -- assuming she holds the traditionally Democratic states. She also likely would win with a victory in Ohio or Florida, even without Pennsylvania, a sign of her strong position. But that state, with its long history favoring Democrats, may offer her the easiest path forward.
""Pennsylvania is key to the entire race"" as a must-win state for Mr. Trump, said Mitch Stewart, who was battleground states director for Mr. Obama's 2012 re-election. For Mrs. Clinton, Pennsylvania likely would be the ""tipping point"""" -- the state that puts a candidate over 270 electoral votes when states are listed in order of the winner's most-likely victories, he said.
Florida and Ohio, big states with large shares of electoral votes, long have been presidential battlegrounds, but demographic changes have made North Carolina, long a Republican stronghold, more favorable to Democrats. Then-Sen. Barack Obama won the state in 2008, though not in 2012.
While Mr. Trump's first round of television advertising is restricted to four states, the Clinton campaign is airing ads in those states as well as in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada, three other swing states. It also is on the air in Omaha, hoping to pick off one electoral vote available in Nebraska, which allocates its share in part by congressional district.
Those decisions show the campaigns' true priorities, amid predictions from Mr. Trump that he would win a string of Democratic-leaning states such as Minnesota, which hasn't backed a Republican for president since 1972.
For her part, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has funneled money for field organizers to Georgia and Arizona, where polling, unlike in Minnesota, shows tight races. On Tuesday, the Clinton campaign opened a campaign office in Utah, which last voted Democratic in 1964.
Democrats say they don't expect to necessarily win GOP-leaning states beyond the core battlegrounds. But they hope the moves will entice the Trump campaign to shift money from top-priority contests.
Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment. A Republican strategist close to the Trump campaign suggested the GOP nominee might want to spend some of his time and money in these traditionally Republican states. He cited the volatile immigration issue as having an unpredictable impact on Arizona and said it might be necessary to work on voter mobilization in Georgia.
Retaining Arizona, Georgia and Utah is essential for Mr. Trump, but for Mrs. Clinton, victory there likely would be Electoral College gravy. So, the Clinton campaign is focused on winning the states most likely to put her over the top, starting with Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, said Marlon Marshall, Mrs. Clinton's director of state campaigns and political engagement.
Heading into the 2016 election, Democrats enjoyed a built-in advantage in the Electoral College. In every election since 1992, Democrats have won a set of 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, that add up to 242 Electoral College votes. Republicans have consistently held 13 states with 102 electoral votes.
Mr. Schriefer, the GOP strategist, said that given current polling, the challenge for Mr. Trump is to increase his popularity with broad swaths of the electorate, not to turn things around in any particular state.
The strategist close to the Trump campaign said the GOP nominee has some options, predicting his message would resonate where there is economic anxiety, such as Michigan and Wisconsin. Victories there would give Mr. Trump more options for assembling states for an Electoral College majority. The Clinton campaign has sent field organizers to both states but so far hasn't spent money on TV ads for either place.

Election 2016: Clinton Hosted Ukrainian at 2012 Dinner --- Report by AP details other meetings with foundation donors by the secretary of state,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813587059?accountid=12768,"While she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton hosted a dinner involving Clinton Foundation donors, including a Ukrainian businessman who had given money to the organization and who had retained a lobbyist to arrange State Department meetings.
The dinner attended by Victor Pinchuk four years ago was mentioned in a new batch of State Department emails obtained by the conservative group Citizens United through public-records requests and released on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a report Tuesday by the Associated Press based on a partial release of State Department calendars showed that at least 85 of 154 people outside government who met or spoke on the phone with Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state donated funds to the Clinton Foundation. The review showed the donors had collectively given up to $156 million.
A note about the dinner from a foundation official to Huma Abedin, one of Mrs. Clinton's top deputies at the State Department, described the event as a ""Clinton Foundation dinner"" in June 2012 at the home of the Democratic presidential nominee and included a list of guests.
The list is an elite corps of Obama administration officials, Democratic donors, political consultants and foundation donors.
Republican critics say the dinner is an illustration of what they describe as the overlapping interests between Clinton Foundation donors and the Clinton-led State Department. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has called for a special prosecutor to examine dealings during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat.
The Clinton campaign didn't respond to a request for comment about the dinner. A Clinton Foundation spokesman declined to comment.
People who attended the 2012 dinner at Mrs. Clinton's home in Washington said Mr. Pinchuk spent no more than a minute talking to Mrs. Clinton on a receiving line.
A spokesman for Mr. Pinchuk's foundation, Thomas Weihe, said: ""Victor never said something to the Clintons that would be in his own interests in terms of earning money or gaining power, to the best of my knowledge.""
Mr. Pinchuk's Ukraine-based foundation donated at least $8.6 million to the Clinton Foundation when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state.
During the period in which he attended the dinner, Mr. Pinchuk had retained Doug Schoen as a lobbyist to help set up meetings with State Department and White House officials in part to promote the goal of democratization in the Ukraine. Mr. Schoen is a former adviser to former President Bill Clinton.
The AP report was the result of a three-year-old request for Mrs. Clinton's calendar and schedules and offers a partial picture of her meetings. Not included in the findings were meetings with federal employees and foreign-government representatives.
In a statement Tuesday night, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said the AP story offered an incomplete and misleading portrait of her time at the State Department.
""This story relies on utterly flawed data,"" he said. ""It cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary Clinton's schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation.""

Election 2016: Clinton Offers Plan For Small Business,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813143055?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is proposing a package of ideas aimed at helping small businesses, including a new standard deduction that could simplify tax filing and improvements to a little-used tax credit for companies that offer workers health insurance.
Mrs. Clinton also would let small businesses immediately deduct up to $1 million in capital expenses against their taxes. The current limit is $500,000.
Mrs. Clinton plans to tout the plan Tuesday in a conference call with small-business owners around the country, the campaign said. Vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine plans to discuss it at an event in Colorado with small-business owners.
To make tax filing simpler, Mrs. Clinton would create a new, optional standard deduction for small businesses like the one available for individual filers. That means those companies with more modest expenses could avoid the need to document their overhead costs for the purposes of taxation.
That proposal represents a rare effort by Mrs. Clinton to simplify the tax code. Many of her other policies involve adding tax credits to help lower health costs, encourage apprenticeships and achieve other goals.
She also wants to quadruple a start-up deduction now available to lower the cost of starting a business.
To encourage more small businesses to offer their workers health insurance, she would simplify and expand an underused tax credit created by the Affordable Care Act.
Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office found that in 2014, just 181,000 employers claimed the credit. That is a tiny fraction of the estimated 1.4 million to four million businesses eligible for the help, the report said.
In Washington, the lobby groups that represent small businesses tilt heavily toward Republicans, taking issue with Democratic efforts to raise taxes on businesses that file via their high-income owners' individual returns, as well as to increase regulations.
But from the start of her campaign, Mrs. Clinton has cast herself as a champion of small businesses.
On the trail, she often talks about her father's ""really small"" drapery business, which he ran when she was growing up in suburban Chicago. She sometimes says she wants to be the ""small-business president.""

Judge Sets Email Deadline --- Order on Clinton correspondence comes as new foundation trove is released,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813142235?accountid=12768,"Corrections & Amplifications
Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa of Bahrain established the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Programme in 1999. In 2005, the crown prince made a commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative that he would further fund his program with $32 million. An Aug. 23 page-one article about a judge's order in the matter of Hillary Clinton's private email server incorrectly said that the crown prince launched the program in 2005 through the CGI.
(WSJ August 29, 2016)
A federal judge prodded the State Department to quickly review a batch of 14,900 recently discovered emails as the controversy over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's correspondence while she served as America's top diplomat continued to simmer.
Judge James Boasberg, in an order, set a deadline for the department to complete the email review by Sept. 22 to determine which ones contain sensitive government information and which are strictly personal conversations. That could pave the way for the emails to be released as early as mid-October.
The emails were found by the Federal Bureau of Investigation during its probe of Mrs. Clinton's use of private email when she was secretary of state. The FBI concluded in July that no crimes had been committed.
The judge's request came on the same day as the release of a separate batch of emails showing a Clinton Foundation official seeking access to the department while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state.
Those emails, obtained through a lawsuit by a conservative watchdog group, kept the Clinton family's charitable foundation in the limelight as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was attacking its activities.
In one email exchange, from June 2009, Doug Band of the Clinton Foundation wrote to Huma Abedin, a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department, seeking a meeting between the crown prince of Bahrain and Mrs. Clinton.
""Cp of Bahrain in tomorrow to Friday. Asking to see her,"" wrote Mr. Band, using shorthand for ""crown prince."" Mr. Band, a longtime aide of former President Bill Clinton, added: ""Good friend of ours.""
Ms. Abedin, who now works for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, responded that Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa had sought a meeting with Mrs. Clinton the previous week ""thru normal channels,"" and that the secretary of state had said she ""doesn't want to commit to anything for Thurs or Fri until she knows how she will feel.""
Two days later, Ms. Abedin wrote to Mr. Band again: ""We have reached out thru official channels.""
The new emails show that while Mr. Band sought to pass along the wishes of donors, Ms. Abedin deferred to official channels. The emails were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the group Judicial Watch against the State Department. The 725 pages of emails from Mrs. Clinton's personal server included material that wasn't handed over to the government as part of the Democratic nominee's archive.
Josh Schwerin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, defended Mrs. Clinton's and Ms. Abedin's actions at the State Department. ""Once again, this right-wing organization that has been going after the Clintons since the 1990s is distorting facts to make utterly false attacks,"" he said. ""No matter how this group tries to mischaracterize these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation,"" he said.
A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, a nonprofit established by Mr. Clinton, didn't return requests for comment.
At a rally in Akron, Ohio, on Monday, Mr. Trump devoted a significant portion of his speech to attacking the Clinton Foundation, which he described as a ""pay-for-play"" operation. Earlier in the day, before the emails were released, he had called for the Clinton Foundation to be shut down entirely.
While meetings with foreign heads of state is a primary role for a U.S. secretary of state, critics of Mrs. Clinton have raised questions about Clinton Foundation donors' access to the State Department during her tenure.
The Kingdom of Bahrain has donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation since its founding, according to the organization's disclosures. The crown prince in 2005 launched a scholarship program through the Clinton Global Initiative, a wing of the foundation that coordinates charitable projects, that was intended to ""educate select Bahraini students to take leadership roles in the private and public sectors,"" according to the CGI website. By 2010, the crown prince had spent more than $32 million on the project, according to the website. The funds don't go to CGI.
In a separate email exchange, Mr. Band sought Ms. Abedin's help in obtaining a visa for a member of a U.K. soccer league at the request of Casey Wasserman, president of the Wasserman Foundation, which donated between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.
""I doubt we can do anything, but maybe we can help with an interview,"" Ms. Abedin wrote. ""I'll ask."" She wrote again: ""I got this now, makes me nervous to get involved but I'll ask.""
Mr. Band responded: ""Then don't.""
A spokeswoman for Mr. Wasserman said the forwarded email request never resulted in a visa. Mr. Band declined to comment on Monday.
The new emails were also notable because they discussed an interaction between a Clinton Foundation donor and Mrs. Clinton. Past email exchanges have depicted foundation officials seeking access to State Department officials, but not the secretary of state herself.
While Mrs. Clinton is no longer involved with the foundation, her husband and daughter, Chelsea, continue to attend the organization's events. The Clinton Foundation said both would stop raising money for the organization and turn over operations to independent parties if Mrs. Clinton were elected.
While at the State Department, Ms. Abedin received a special designation from the agency that allowed her to work there while also doing outside work. During that period, she held two other positions, at the Clinton Foundation and at Teneo, a consulting firm founded by Mr. Band.
Mr. Band was a chief adviser in helping the former president launch the Clinton Foundation after leaving the White House.

"Main Street: Hillary and Bill Clinton, Inc.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813057335?accountid=12768,"Many Clinton scandals ago, when Hillary Clinton was trying to explain how she'd parlayed a $1,000 stake in cattle futures into $100,000 in 10 months (by talking to other people and reading The Wall Street Journal) folks were skeptical. How, they asked, could a novice make so much money in so short a time in such a risky market?
Turns out Mrs. Clinton is a better learner than she's given credit for, and the Clinton emails released by Judicial Watch on Monday prove it. The emails were pried out of the system by Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, and they suggest why the Clinton Foundation could be so attractive to the rich and mighty. When a donor had a problem that required the secretary of state's attention, there was Doug Band -- a Clinton Foundation exec -- emailing Hillary's top staffers at the State Department to ask a favor.
Take a June 23, 2009, email from Doug Band to Huma Abedin. In his email Mr. Band noted that the Crown Prince of Bahrain (a ""good friend of ours"") was asking to see Mrs. Clinton. There are, of course, many ways to be a ""good friend,"" but one sure way would be to contribute between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, as the kingdom of Bahrain had done. Not to mention that the prince had also spent $32 million on a scholarship launched through the Clinton Global Initiative.
Ms. Abedin responded that the prince had sought a meeting through ""normal"" channels but had been shot down. Less than 48 hours after Mr. Band had asked her, Ms. Abedin reported that ""we have reached out through official channels."" The meeting was on.
It isn't the only favor Mr. Band requested. A month earlier, he had emailed Ms. Abedin to ask her help in getting an English soccer player a visa to the U.S. The player was supposed to come to Las Vegas for a team celebration, but he needed a special interview with the visa section at the American Embassy in London due to a ""criminal charge"" against him.
Because of this, the office of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) had refused to intervene. Mr. Band's email made clear the request was on behalf of Casey Wasserman, a sports and entertainment exec who had contributed between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation via the Wasserman Foundation.
These are only two of the many email exchanges in which Ms. Abedin was asked to intervene on behalf of some Clinton Foundation donor. These latest emails fit the same pattern as another batch released earlier this month, which showed Mr. Band asking Ms. Abedin and longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills for a meeting with a U.S. ambassador on behalf of a foreign businessman, as well as seeking a job for someone he described as ""important to take care of.""
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton sums it up this way: ""It looks like the State Department was outsourcing its work to the Clinton Foundation.""
The model worked well for the Clintons, and some believe the Clinton Foundation will be copied by other pols, who will set up spouses or friends with foundations in hopes of attracting the big dollars that they can use to advance their brands, reward their friends and operate as a de facto permanent political campaign -- all under the garb of charity.
No doubt some will try. But no one will be as successful as the Clintons have been.
The reason is simple. The Clintons are a business partnership with something that no other political couple has to sell. True, all ex-presidents hit the speaking circuit and have charities and foundations. Even so, the Clintons are unique in having an ex-president with a spouse in play, not only as secretary of state but as a possible president herself. If you are a foreign government or a wealthy businessmen, a donation to the Clinton Foundation might look like an excellent investment at just about any price.
Quid pro quo is notoriously hard to prove in such cases, and we will never know what (if anything) Mrs. Clinton or State delivered in return. We're asked to believe that it was somehow an accident that so many of the millions former President Bill Clinton raked in from speaking fees would come from companies, countries or people who had business before a State Department run by his wife. The truth is, this was inevitable under the Clinton Foundation business model. And it beggars belief to think all these dollars were being given out without an expectation of something in return.
In the meantime we are back to a presidential campaign in which Donald Trump's critics attack his business record by pointing out that the New York City real-estate mogul doesn't even own many of the buildings that bear his name. What he's selling is the Trump brand.
Then again, when it comes to dubious branding for profit, these latest emails make Mr. Trump look like a piker compared with Mrs. Clinton.

Clinton's Colin Powell Excuse,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813057278?accountid=12768,"When Bill and Hillary Clinton get caught for bad behavior, they follow a familiar pattern. First deny, then call it old news, then roll out the attack machine of media and political allies to trash whoever needs to be collateral damage to save them. The private email-Clinton Foundation saga is now in phase three, and no less than Colin Powell has been drafted as roadkill.
The Powell-made-Hillary-do-it defense emerged late last week in two parts. The New York Times reported that FBI interview notes turned over to Congress last week show that Mrs. Clinton told the G-men that Mr. Powell had advised her to use a personal email account. The Times didn't name its source, but in these cases always ask who benefits from the leak? Answer: Mrs. Clinton.
The Times also reported in the same story that the advance copy of a new book by Joe Conason backs up the blame-it-on-Powell story. Aficionados of Clinton scandals will remember Mr. Conason as the most dedicated stenographer in the Clinton stable.
Mr. Conason has written a biography of Bill Clinton, ""Man of the World."" And the Times reports that the book relates a conversation early in Mrs. Clinton's time at State at a dinner party hosted by Madeleine Albright, another former Secretary of State. Mr. Conason writes that Mr. Powell ""told [Mrs. Clinton] to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer.""
Mr. Conason writes that this conversation ""confirmed a decision she had made months earlier -- to keep her personal account and use it for most messages."" The Times notes that Mr. Conason ""interviewed both Mr. and Mrs. Clinton for the book."" Voila, the Clintons are back at their old standby, the everybody-does-it defense.
Mr. Powell's office released a statement saying he doesn't recall that dinner conversation. And at a weekend event on Long Island, Mr. Powell told People magazine and the New York Post that Mrs. Clinton ""was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did."" He added: ""Her people have been trying to pin it on me.""
This isn't the first time Mrs. Clinton has tried the Powell defense. In February she twisted the findings of State Department Inspector General Steve Linnick to claim that Mr. Powell had routinely used private email and was also subject to bogus classification claims. Yet Mr. Powell never set up a private server, and he used State's classified computer system for classified communications.
Mr. Powell explained in his 2012 memoir that his interest in using private email was to send a message to the bureaucracy about improving State Department technology. Mrs. Clinton's goal by contrast was to hide all of her emails from federal disclosure laws.
The latest evidence for this conclusion is Monday's news that during its email probe the FBI uncovered 15,000 work-related emails sent to or from Mrs. Clinton that she failed to turn over to the State Department. That is nearly 50% more than the 30,000 she did turn in, and she had promised to turn over all work-related emails.
Also on Monday Judicial Watch released more emails showing the close ties between the Clinton State Department and Clinton Foundation. In a June 23, 2009 email, former Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band wrote to Clinton aide Human Abedin at State: ""Cp of Bahrain in tomorrow to Friday Asking to see her Good friend of ours[.]""
The ""Cp"" refers to Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain. The Crown Prince had established a scholarship program with the Clinton Global Initiative in 2005, and by 2010 he had contributed $32 million.
These latest emails are further evidence that Mrs. Clinton set up her private server to prevent the public from seeing how Hillary and Bill mixed public power with their personal financial and political ambitions via the family foundation. When she got caught, Mrs. Clinton cherry-picked the emails she'd turn over to State and tried to destroy the rest. Meanwhile, everyone important in the world understood that a gift to the Clinton Foundation was a way to influence the U.S. government.
As for Mr. Powell, the Clintons have never had any scruple about tarnishing someone else's reputation to protect their path to power. Maybe they'll make it up to him with an invitation to a State Dinner for the Crown Prince of Bahrain.",2016-11-17
Clinton's Bailout for the College-Industrial Complex,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813056406?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's plan for higher education is simple: a massive bailout wrapped in the promise of free tuition and relief from student loans. It's a proposal that seems specifically designed to further inflate the higher-education bubble, while relieving the college-industrial complex of any pressure to reform.
This may make for good politics, but it won't cure what really ails universities: College today costs too much, takes too long and offers dubious value to too many students. For decades, the price of a degree has risen much faster than the rate of inflation. The total cost of a four-year education at some public colleges, including tuition and fees, can surpass $120,000 for out-of-state students. The figure could easily top $200,000 at a private college.
In other words, sending a son or daughter to a private university is akin to buying a BMW every year. If the student finances the bill with loans, it's more like buying a Lamborghini on credit -- and then driving it off a cliff.
Total student-loan debt has hit $1.3 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve, exceeding both the nation's credit-card debt and its auto loans. Two-thirds of students now borrow to pay for their education, up from 45% in 1993, according to a New York Times analysis of federal data. At the end of 2014 the average student-loan borrower owed $26,700, according to analysts at the New York Fed, while 4% owed $100,000 or more.
Where does all this money go? Campuses vie with one another to add amenities, including Taj-Mahal-like facilities such as Purdue University's $98 million Cordova Recreational Sports Center, touted as featuring a climbing wall, a vortex pool and a 25-person spa. Meantime, schools are spending more than ever on administration, promotions, athletics and noninstructional student services. The New England Center for Investigative Reporting and the American Institutes for Research found that between 1987 and 2012, colleges added 517,636 administrators and professional employees, creating a ratio at public colleges of two non-academic staffers for every full-time, tenure-track faculty member.
Despite a lagging economy, colleges have indulged a culture of bread and circuses -- simply because they can. Forgiving student debt or providing ""free"" tuition, with no new accountability measures, will only worsen today's problems for future generations. The multibillion-dollar bailout Mrs. Clinton has proposed would only shift the costs of higher education to taxpayers, many of whom have not had the benefit of college. The Democratic nominee's plan would also encourage more students to make poor educational choices by creating the illusion that college is free.
The tough reality is that despite the cant about ""college for all,"" too many young people go to university. Many go to the wrong colleges to study the wrong subjects. Others graduate with costly diplomas but lack the skills necessary to begin a worthwhile career. Some 40% of students fail to get a degree within six years. Far too many pay too much for too little.
Over the past five decades, billions in state and federal subsidies have contributed significantly to the exploding cost of higher education by making it easier for colleges to justify outrageous amenities. ""Free"" tuition will only further distort the incentives. The flood of cash Mrs. Clinton proposes will give colleges even less reason to restrain spending.
In 1980 the economist Howard Bowen postulated what became known as ""Bowen's Law."" He argued that colleges will always spend all the money they can possibly raise to enhance their prestige. A 2012 study by economists Stephanie Riegg Cellini and Claudia Goldin found that for-profit colleges whose students are eligible for federal aid ""charge tuition that is about 78 percent higher than that charged by comparable institutions whose students cannot apply for federal financial aid."" Moreover: ""The dollar value of the premium is about equal to the amount of grant aid and loan subsidy received.""
Despite what administrators might argue, there is little evidence that additional spending has enhanced the value of the college degree. In a 2014 academic study of collegiate spending, economists Robert E. Martin and R. Carter Hill noted that research universities had cumulatively spent more than half a trillion dollars from 1987 to 2005. ""There should be evidence of higher quality at these investment levels,"" they wrote. Instead, ""completion rates declined, grade inflation increased, students spend less time studying, adult numeracy/literacy rates declined, and critical thinking skills did not improve.""
Real reform of higher education would mean addressing both rising costs and sinking value. The university of the future should be smaller, leaner and more focused on actually teaching undergraduates. Reform also means supporting alternative-education options -- such as two-year and three-year degrees, certification for professions that don't require a bachelor's degree, or Massive Open Online Courses. How's that for a radical proposal?

Shut Down the Clinton Foundation Already,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813861518?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's campaign is in many respects a machine. It relentlessly raises money, methodically runs the ground game and ceaselessly moves her from venue to venue, each event indistinguishable from the next except for Mrs. Clinton's rotating palette of pantsuits.
When it comes to messaging, however, the campaign and its principal operate with crafty prevarication. Consider the report last week about what Mrs. Clinton told the FBI when pressed about her private email: that former Secretary of State Colin Powell advised her to use it.
Mr. Powell disputes Mrs. Clinton's account, telling People magazine that she had been using private email ""for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did."" And he didn't set up a server in his basement, use his private account to send classified information, or hide his emails from investigators -- all of which Mrs. Clinton did. Little wonder Gen. Powell said that ""her people have been trying to pin it on me.""
This is merely one of Mrs. Clinton's latest difficulties. She told CNN last year that when she left government service, ""I turned over everything I was obligated to turn over."" But news broke this week that the FBI found nearly 15,000 more work-related emails.
In response, her campaign spokesman claimed that she ""provided the State Department with all the work-related emails she had in her possession in 2014."" This was misleading. By then she had already destroyed thousands of emails. FBI specialists recovered this latest batch from other people's accounts or from the server that she had scrubbed.
A federal judge has pushed the state department to finish its review of these emails by Sept. 22, meaning they could be released only weeks before the election. When Mrs. Clinton appeared Monday on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" she was nonchalant. ""My emails are so boring,"" she said. ""We've already released, I don't know, 30,000 plus, so what's a few more?""
Yet every new batch reminds voters that Mrs. Clinton routinely lied, highlights why FBI director James Comey called her ""extremely careless"" in handling sensitive information, and reveals additional special treatment given to Clinton Foundation donors.
The foundation received many millions of dollars from foreign governments and nationals while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, including via a Canadian front group set up to shield donors' identities. This despite Mrs. Clinton's promise at her January 2009 confirmation to provide ""the transparency and disclosure that is needed"" and ""address even the appearance of conflict.""
Newly released emails show foundation staff intervened with the State Department on behalf of donors, foreign and domestic. On Tuesday the Associated Press released an analysis of official calendars for the first half of Mrs. Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. At least 85 of the 154 private persons with whom she had scheduled meetings or phone calls were also Clinton Foundation donors, having contributed as much as $156 million. The AP had to sue to obtain this information, yet Mrs. Clinton's campaign responded by complaining that the report looked at only half of her tenure.
The Clinton Foundation has long been criticized for spending too little on programs and too much on overhead -- including flying the Clintons around in private planes and employing lackeys like Sidney Blumenthal. The Clintons justified their practices by saying that the foundation performed good work.
Mrs. Clinton hopes that half measures will restore public confidence. For instance, this newspaper reports that if Mrs. Clinton wins in November the foundation plans to ""scale back"" and ban foreign contributions. Is there no potential for abuse if only Americans donate? Mrs. Clinton should pledge to shut down the Clinton Foundation if elected.
Even that wouldn't end the potential for pay to play. One of Mrs. Clinton's major economic proposals is an infrastructure bank. As she explained to Fox News's Chris Wallace, she would ""seed it with federal dollars, but bring in private investors.""
Such a quasigovernment entity, staffed by loyalists, would lead to an explosion of crony capitalism, taking taxes from ordinary Americans and transferring them to the Clintons' allies. It would be Solyndra on steroids.
Through their entire political careers, the Clintons have believed that there is one set of rules for them and another for everyone else. This has helped make Mrs. Clinton the second-most unpopular candidate for president (after Donald Trump) in the modern era. Even the vaunted Clinton political machine is having a tough time compensating for her prevarications.
Voters don't seem to much like Mrs. Clinton and certainly don't trust her. They have ample reasons for their judgments.
