Ted Cruz Values a Lot of the Things We Value; To Mr. Cruz I say: Aim your fury at Hillary and Bernie.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761499958?accountid=12768,"Regarding Bret Stephens's ""What Ted Cruz Values "" (Global View, Jan. 26): I am a very conservative voter, and I will vote for the eventual GOP presidential nominee, whomever it is. I am tired of the GOP voters who stay at home on Election Day because the nominee isn't conservative enough, or took money from this person or that super PAC, or changed his or her position on some issue. Not showing up on Election Day because the nominee doesn't fulfill your profile of an ideal candidate is a losing strategy (see Mitt Romney and John McCain). The object of the entire GOP tent should be to win the presidency, giving one at least four years to convince the president and Congress to work on laws favorable to your stand on particular issues.If folks like Mr. Cruz continue to divide the GOP and polarize groups of supporters, they will never convince enough independent-minded voters that the GOP presidential nominee is capable of leading this country out of the mess that President Obama and the progressive left have made for the last seven years.To Mr. Cruz I say: Aim your fury at Hillary and Bernie, play to win the election with the ""most conservative candidate who can win"" (as William F. Buckley said), and then try to make policy changes using the system and our American political process.Mark PetrusHomewood, Ill.I share some of Mr. Stephens's pessimism but given the real state of the union, Ted Cruz represents a real change of direction. Whatever he does can't be worse than the path we are on now. To be successful, he must appeal to less sophisticated and demanding Americans than Mr. Stephens.Among the current candidates one doesn't find the ideal package, so one must decide what one most wants and choose from an imperfect group. Playing Diogenes is a cop-out.John PeggSpokane, Wash.I am a Ted Cruz supporter. I agree that he used one wrong word--he should have called Donald Trump a ""New York liberal,"" rather than referring to ""New York values."" If he had gotten that word right, he would have been accurate. Mr. Trump is at best a Nelson Rockefeller Republican.Donald W. LargeGreen Valley, Ariz.Any solid conservative knows Mr. Cruz, in his dismissal of ""New York values,"" was referring to those in New York City who chased away Wal-Mart and its hundreds of jobs, and those in Albany who outlawed fracking and its numerous economic benefits. I, and millions like me, support Sen. Cruz and embrace his values and traditional conservatism.Patrick J. CallahanSouthampton, Pa.",2/1/16
Obama's Democratic Divide; How the President created Bernie's best political issue.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761853327?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is campaigning as a better heir than Bernie Sanders to sustain President Obama's legacy, but if she wants to know why she's having such a hard time closing the deal, she might want to blame . . . President Obama.That's one of the intriguing messages from the entrance polls of Democratic Iowa caucus voters. The pollsters asked caucus-goers to choose one of four issues that mattered most to them in voting for a candidate. Mrs. Clinton easily won on health care, terrorism, and even the economy and jobs (51% to 42%).But Mr. Sanders won big on the fourth issue: income inequality, which 27% of voters said was most important. The Vermont socialist won 61% of those voters while Mrs. Clinton settled for 34%. This no doubt reflects that Bernie has made inequality a major theme in his campaign, but then again socialists have been railing about the gap between rich and poor for decades.The question is why this issue is resonating so much with Democrats this year, and we think Mr. Obama gets the credit in two ways. The President himself has made income inequality an abiding concern across his time in office, and his followers have come to believe him. ""I believe this is the defining challenge of our time,"" Mr. Obama said on Dec. 4, 2013.Mr. Obama's other contribution is that his economic policies have, if anything, widened the income gap. Middle-class income gains have been meager thanks to the historically slow economic expansion, while Americans who own stocks or other assets have seen their wealth and incomes increase thanks to Federal Reserve policies targeting asset prices.When a President calls an issue ""defining"" and then makes the problem worse, it's no surprise that some other politician will take up the cudgel. Mr. Sanders's political obsession is Mr. Obama's creation.",2/2/16
Hillary Clinton Beats Bernie Sanders by Slim Margin in Iowa; Both candidates begin weeklong sprint in New Hampshire after 'historically close' race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761853250?accountid=12768,"Jennifer Levitz contributed to this article.NASHUA, N.H.--Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses Tuesday, barely surviving a surprisingly stiff challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders, as the two candidates arrived in New Hampshire to begin a weeklong dash to the nation's first primary.The Iowa Democratic Party declared the caucuses ""historically close."" Final results put Mrs. Clinton's delegate count at 49.9%, to Mr. Sanders's 49.6%. Mrs. Clinton's victory means she will collect 23 of Iowa's delegates and Mr. Sanders will get 21. It takes 2,382 to win the Democratic nomination for president.The race was called for Mrs. Clinton by the Iowa Democratic Party and, by early afternoon, the Associated Press.The close margin didn't stop Mrs. Clinton from declaring an outright victory. ""I am so thrilled that I'm coming to New Hampshire after winning Iowa,"" she told the crowd at a get-out-the-vote event in Nashua, N.H. ""I've won and lost there--it's a lot better to win.""Mr. Sanders, though, said Tuesday afternoon he wasn't ready to concede the close Iowa race to his rival.""We want to look at some of the numbers,"" he told reporters after his first post-Iowa rally in the college town of Keene, N.H., a short drive from his home state of Vermont.Mr. Sanders portrayed his performance in Iowa--after surging from little name recognition and low polling--as one for the political record books.""We made history,"" he said. ""We fought Clinton to a virtual tie.""A third candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, finished far behind the two leaders and dropped out Monday night.The results came after a campaign in which Mrs. Clinton argued that she is the one who can advance the Democratic agenda, and with a sophisticated ground operation that her campaign began building on the day she announced her candidacy in April.Both Democratic contenders were digging in for what promises to be a protracted campaign, and far from the coronation many expected when Mrs. Clinton launched her candidacy in April.Election 2016* Clinton Briefly Savors Victory, Gets Back to Work* Cruz Defeats Trump in Iowa GOP Caucus* Cruz, Rubio Shift the GOP Conversation* Capital Journal: Front-Runners Give Ground as Rivals Make Mark* Cruz Sticks With Religion, Reagan in New Hampshire* New Hampshire Primary Is an Unpredictable One* Clinton, Sanders Turn to South Carolina's Black VotersAddressing her supporters in Des Moines on Monday night, Mrs. Clinton signaled a long battle ahead between her brand of pragmatism and his call for a political revolution.""It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now: to have a real contest of ideas, to really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for."" She added that she was ""breathing a big sigh of relief.""Mr. Sanders, a Vermont independent who attracted large and passionate crowds with his clarion call for a political revolution and an unabashedly liberal agenda, claimed a measure of victory of his own.""I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message,"" Mr. Sanders told cheering supporters. ""It's just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics."" His cheering supporters replied, ""Feel the Bern!""The outcome offered a measure of vindication for Mrs. Clinton, whose third-place finish in Iowa eight years ago made clear that her once-inevitable campaign faced a serious threat from another challenger, then-Sen. Barack Obama.Still, Mr. Sanders's success exposes real vulnerabilities with her candidacy.Both candidates flew overnight to New Hampshire to begin a weeklong sprint to the Granite State primary, where Mr. Sanders is 18 points ahead of Mrs. Clinton, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls. With strong fundraising, Mr. Sanders is positioned to press forward for the foreseeable future, though the Clinton campaign sees advantages in the states that come later in the month.The Iowa results were delivered from precincts across 99 counties after a 10-month campaign that showered attention on this rural Midwestern state, which has long taken pride in its role as the first stop on the road to the presidential nomination.Over dozens of trips to Iowa high schools and diners, in small discussions and big rallies, the two candidates engaged in a vigorous and sometimes sharp debate as Mrs. Clinton positioned herself as a pragmatic, can-do fighter, while Mr. Sanders appealed to the party's most deeply held ideals.She battled reports that classified material was sent via her private email system. He battled suggestions that he couldn't win a general election, and that he has no real plan to implement his agenda.On Monday, some Clinton supporters said they were drawn to Mr. Sanders but, in the end, concluded his call for a political revolution would be easier said than done--a point Mrs. Clinton voiced repeatedly.""I think he's wonderful man, but I don't think what he says is realistic,"" said Michelle Wilson, a corporate compliance administrator from West Des Moines. She served as a precinct captain for Mr. Obama in 2008; on Monday, she came to caucus for Mrs. Clinton.But in Clive, west of Des Moines, Carol Ferrell, 59, decided at the last minute to support Mr. Sanders. ""As much as I admire Hillary Clinton, she's got a lot of baggage,"" she said.The candidates offer Democrats with two very different visions for governing.In speeches that remained almost identical across months of campaigning, Mr. Sanders promised to break up large banks, said Wall Street is built on fraud and unapologetically vowed to impose higher taxes to provide universal health care , free tuition at public colleges and more generous Social Security benefits. At a rally on Saturday, as Mr. Sanders ticked off society's problems, the crowd spontaneously began chanting, ""Enough is enough!""Mrs. Clinton, for her part, highlighted her perseverance and qualifications for the presidency, including four years as secretary of state, along with what she describes as a pragmatic, effective approach to governing. She also portrayed herself as the most electable candidate whose nomination is necessary to block Republican ideas.Her policy platform includes a new program for debt-free tuition and an increase in solar panels, as well as changes in health care and Social Security that are more modest than her rival's.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",2/2/16

"Martin O'Malley to Drop Out of Democratic Presidential Race; Campaign overshadowed by Clinton, Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761582971?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, IOWA--The first casualty of Iowa's caucuses is former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who announced Monday night that he was dropping out of the Democratic presidential race after a disappointing showing .Mr. O'Malley told supporters at a Des Moines bar that he was suspending a campaign that never gained traction against rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. He did not endorse either of the two.With about 90% of the Iowa caucus results reported, Mr. O'Malley stood at less than 1%.Flashing smiles, Mr. O'Malley said: ""When I got into this, eight months ago, I had no doubt that it would be a tough fight. And it has been a tough fight.""Election 2016* Iowa Caucuses: Live Coverage* Voters Seek Change at Iowa Caucuses* Photos: Iowa Caucuses Kick Off U.S. Presidential Election* How the Iowa Caucuses WorkMr. Sanders, in a speech late Monday might, thanked Mr. O'Malley. ""He should know that he contributed a whole lot to the dialogue,"" the Vermont senator said.Mr. O'Malley had sought to position himself as a liberal alternative to Mr. Sanders--a seasoned executive who had the skills to put his ideals into practice. At age 53, he also cast himself as part of a younger generation who was not part of Washington's political culture. The arguments fell flat, though, and he never came within striking distance of Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton. In national polls he never cracked an average of 5%, according to Real Clear Politics.After Mr. O'Malley dropped out, his campaign manager, David Hamrick, sent out an email saying, ""Entering the race as an unknown, he always faced long odds--especially against a candidate as universally known as Secretary Clinton.""Mr. O'Malley jumped in the race in May and struggled to gain name recognition or raise the money needed to be competitive. At some of his events in Iowa, people who came to see him had no idea where he was from or what offices he had held. He collected about $5 million in campaign contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By contrast, Mr. Sanders raised $20 million in the month of January alone.When it came to policy, Mr. O'Malley had little to offer that distinguished him from his rivals. All have said they favor gun control, aggressive steps to combat global climate change and an immigration overhaul that provides undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship.Mr. O'Malley put great stock in the Democratic debates. A fluid speaker with good looks, he hoped to turn in strong debate performances that would cause Clinton and Sanders backers to give him a fresh look. But the schedule approved by Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz did him no favors. The party set a total of only six debates and threatened to punish candidates who took part in debates that it had not sanctioned. Mr. O'Malley accused the party leadership of favoring Mrs. Clinton.In a speech at a Democratic National Committee gathering in Minneapolis in August, he took aim at the party's decision to hold only six debates, saying, ""Whose decree is this actually? Where did it come from? To what end and what purpose? What national or party interest does this decree serve?""(Under pressure from Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, the party now seems likely to accept more debates .)Yet when the debates began last October, Mr. O'Malley found himself a bit player on stage. He could not match Mrs. Clinton's command of policy detail or Mr. Sanders's populist fervor.Before the caucuses, O'Malley aides signaled that the Iowa results would determine whether he would plow forward. When Iowans gathered for the caucuses Monday night, they showed little appetite for his candidacy.At a West Des Moines church, nearly 300 people crammed into a room that was set up to hold about half as many caucusgoers. Only five supported Mr. O'Malley; three were undecided. As the numbers were read aloud, an O'Malley supporter yelled out, ""We beat undecided!""Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Natalie Andrews",2/2/16

Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Take Off Gloves Going Into Iowa Vote; Latest polls show two Democratic candidates locked in tight race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761568161?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, Iowa--Iowa voters were set to decide Monday between upstart liberal Bernie Sanders and Democratic establishment-favorite Hillary Clinton in the state's caucuses, kicking off the presidential primary season with what was expected to be a nail-biter of a race.Mr. Sanders has drawn large, energetic crowds for his brand of ""democratic socialism,"" which includes proposals to create a government-run, single-payer health-care system , increase taxes on the rich, break up big banks and make public colleges tuition free. He is hoping the enthusiastic turnouts at his rallies translate into big turnouts at the caucuses, and that he can leverage a win here to victories in the contests that follow, and ultimately the nomination.Mrs. Clinton, for her part, has highlighted her perseverance and qualifications for the presidency, including four years as secretary of state, along with what she describes as achievable but important policy objectives. She has also pitched herself as the logical successor to President Barack Obama and the most electable Democrat in November's general election, while highlighting the potential for voters to make history in electing the first female president.Polls show Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are locked in a tight race. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll released Saturday showed Mrs. Clinton edging ahead of the Vermont senator, 45% to 42%. A third contender, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, has 3% support in the poll.""It's a tie ballgame, that's where we are,"" Mr. Sanders said Monday . ""We will win tonight if the turnout is high. We will struggle tonight if the turnout is low. That's a fact.""Mr. Sanders, closing out his campaign in Iowa, took a strategic gamble in hopes of notching a victory: He went negative. His campaign ran a new TV spot that implies Mrs. Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street, a criticism he has made of her repeatedly. And after refusing to talk about the Democratic front-runner's use of a private email server as secretary of state , Mr. Sanders on Sunday called her email practices a ""very serious issue"" that could render her unelectable.Similarly, a Clinton campaign that had once ignored the 74-year-old democratic socialist is now casting him as a pie-in-the-sky dreamer whose ideas are utterly impractical.""I don't want to over-promise and under-deliver. I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver,"" she said at an Iowa rally. She added: ""I know what it's going to take.""Mrs. Clinton is also looking to put the ghosts of 2008 behind her, when she placed third and then-Sen. Obama won--and went on to win the Democratic nomination. This time around, Mrs. Clinton has seen Mr. Sanders cut into her once-yawning lead, and he currently runs ahead of her in New Hampshire, the next contest after Iowa.Mrs. Clinton has campaigned with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and daughter, Chelsea Clinton, during the final days leading up to the Iowa caucuses, collectively offering a nostalgia-tinged closing argument for Mrs. Clinton.Election 2016* Iowans Entertain Radical Messages Amid Seeming Prosperity* Trump, Cruz Lead Pack Going Into Unpredictable Iowa Caucus* Why Democratic Lawmakers Hope Cruz or Trump Win GOP Race* Jeb Bush to Iowa: Pick Me, Not 'a Big Blowhard'Mr. Sanders is making the case that Mrs. Clinton is beholden to Wall Street.

He has pledged to usher in a more uplifting style of politics.

But the Vermont senator's success at raising money and attracting young voters has upended the race. The Sanders campaign announced Sunday it had raised $20 million in January alone.On the eve of the caucuses, Iowa was up for grabs.

Bernie realizes that the whole premise of his race is contingent on winning Iowa, and he's trying to do whatever he possibly can at this point to get over the hump.""Spotlighting a vulnerability, Mr. Sanders is making the case that Mrs. Clinton is beholden to Wall Street. Speaking to reporters at a Bloomberg Politics breakfast last week, he mentioned that Mrs. Clinton had just attended a fundraising event at a Philadelphia investment firm.""That's how she has raised money throughout her political career,"" he said. ""Millions of dollars from Wall Street and from other very powerful special interests.""The combative posture poses risks for Mr. Sanders--something his team acknowledges.

He has said he would inspire voters and thus expand turnout on Election Day much as Barack Obama did eight years earlier.Recognizing the potential damage to the Sanders brand, his aides say there are lines he won't cross: He won't air the classic political attack ad complete with ominous music and unflattering pictures of Mrs. Clinton.""He's not going to go there; it's not in the cards,"" said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders campaign strategist.So, instead, some of Mr. Sanders's ads leave it to voters to connect the dots. The latest spot features Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and its role in the 2008 financial collapse. No pictures of Mrs. Clinton's face appear in the ad; her name is never mentioned. Yet she is the star.Mrs. Clinton and her husband have a long history of dealings with Goldman. Together, they have collected nearly $3 million in speaking fees from the company since 2005.In the spot, a narrator says ""millions in campaign contributions and speaking fees"" enabled Wall Street firms to engage in reckless practices.In an interview with NBC News over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton said her opponent's method is to discredit her through ""insinuation and implication.""""That's disappointing,"" she added, ""because he's always prided himself on being a candidate, a politician--he's been in politics a really long time--not to go negative.""As the campaign unfolds Mr. Sanders has flashed increasing irritation at some of the criticism lodged by Team Clinton. Clinton allies have said that Mr. Sanders's socialist views would be exploited by Republicans in a general election.On Sunday, Mr. Sanders tried to turn the tables. Asked by ABC News if he would get ""slapped"" with the socialist label should he win the party's nomination, he pointed to recent disclosures that top secret information passed through Mrs. Clinton's private email server.Having memorably told Mrs. Clinton in a debate in October that Americans were ""sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,"" he said Sunday: ""Look at the front pages in terms of what Secretary Clinton is getting slapped with.""Mrs. Clinton dismissed the latest controversy over her email as an ""interagency dispute"" that pales next to the larger issues on voters' minds.For all the sparring, both campaigns are also taking pains to put out a positive message. But their core arguments are very different.Mrs. Clinton says that her strength is persevering in the face of setbacks. A biographical video that plays for crowds ahead of her appearances ends with Mrs. Clinton saying, ""I don't quit""--a theme of her campaign since it launched last April. She says she has the experience and stamina to both accomplish her goals and beat the Republican nominee this fall.Mr. Sanders is laying out a broader vision of a country that seeks to overturn a political system that favors the richest Americans. He is calling for a bottom-up ""revolution"" that will compel Washington officials to act in the interests of a struggling middle class.A huge rally he held Saturday in the college town of Iowa City captured the campaign's mood. As he finished his remarks, the rock band Vampire Weekend took the stage and invoked an optimistic spirit of America at its best. The band played Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land,"" and were joined by Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, who, together with the crowd sang along: ""From the redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters, this land was made for you and me.""Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",2/2/16
"Hillary and Bernie Recall LBJ More Than JFK; JFK is remembered primarily for his tragic death, not for his too-brief push for lower-tax, pro-growth, supply-side economic policies.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762157283?accountid=12768,"Regarding Edward P. Lazear's ""If Only Hillary and Bernie Would Recall JFK "" (op-ed, Jan. 29): While it is true that individual Americans migrate among all five annual income quintiles, all boats don't move up and down by the same amount in a rising tide.Regarding Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the questions for America include whether they want to limit boating or add a ton of freight to some people's boats, and not allow other vessels to sail during any tide. President John F. Kennedy understood incentives. He understood, 20-plus years before the Laffer curve, that if you want more of something, tax it less. Americans may not be able to handle a president with policies that mandate some boats get torpedoed, while others are allowed to sail on subsidized biofuel.Michael J. Perullo, CPAAtlantaMr. Lazear claims President Kennedy believed ""a rising tide lifts all boats."" However, that was only until JFK read ""The Other America,"" Michael Harrington's 1962 exposé of the millions of Americans left behind as the country prospered in the post-World War II boom. Afterward, Kennedy immediately directed his Council of Economic Advisers to look into the issue of poverty in America. Chairman Walter Heller and the council concluded that, in fact, a rising tide doesn't lift all boats.Records show that poverty was one of the last things JFK focused on before his assassination, and that he wanted to make it central to his 1964 legislative agenda. Lyndon Johnson took up this charge and launched the War on Poverty, designed to be a hand up--not a handout--and lift people out of poverty.Class warfare isn't the answer, but it's about time to realize that it takes a lot more than tax cuts and other incentives for the so-called ""job creators"" to lift today's 50 million Americans out of poverty and revitalize the country's struggling middle class. Now, if only Hillary and Bernie would recall LBJ.Tyler RossChicagoIt is a testament to Democratic and media image-making that JFK is remembered primarily for his ""Camelot"" White House and his tragic death, not for his too-brief push for lower-tax, pro-growth, supply-side economic policies. The one stain on JFK's thousand days in the White House was his support of a disastrous attempt to overturn Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba. That failure allowed the Castro brothers to show what happens to an economy that is built on class warfare rather than growth. Many leftist American admirers of Castro are flocking to Cuba before capitalists start renovating the dilapidated buildings in Havana and destroy its 1950s ambience. Cuba's economy needs to cross the bridge to the 1960s before making any leap into the 21st century.Why can't we learn that class war is economic hell for all classes?William HoganSavannah, Ga.President Kennedy also said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.""The Democratic Party message of 2008, ever more strident now, is: ""The government will see that your needs are met.

Democrats Battle Over Vision for Party; Hillary Clinton's narrow win over Bernie Sanders in Iowa magnifies debate over whether party should emphasize idealism or pragmatism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761864169?accountid=12768,"Jennifer Levitz contributed to this article.Hillary Clinton's razor-thin win over Sen. Bernie Sanders in Iowa is magnifying a battle among Democrats over whether they should emphasize idealism or pragmatism.As the Democratic presidential race moved on to New Hampshire on Tuesday, both candidates signaled that they would press their cases in the ideological clash over the direction of the party.In Keene, N.H., on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders was asked whether Mrs. Clinton is a progressive. ""Some days,"" he replied. ""Except when she announces she's a moderate. Then she's not a progressive.""For her part, Mrs. Clinton frequently describes herself as a ""progressive who gets things done.""On issue after issue, Mr. Sanders sees a more robust role for government than Mrs. Clinton does, and he calls for significant new taxes and programs to address what he considers unmet needs. Enacting his agenda, he says, will require a ""political revolution'' in which Americans demand change so loudly that Congress cannot ignore them.In Mrs. Clinton's view, a more targeted and in some cases more modest approach can best solve problems. Better to find consensus on something achievable than to wage an extended battle that will only lead to gridlock.""It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now: to have a real contest of ideas, to really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for,"" Mrs. Clinton said Monday night in Des Moines, after the slimmest of victories in the Iowa caucuses, the opening contest in the presidential nominating season.The debate is important for Democrats' identity and for setting the party's course on policy, as well as for its political implications.Many Democrats fear Mr. Sanders is too liberal to win a general election, and some are concerned that Mrs. Clinton will be pressured to take left-leaning positions that could hurt her, if she wins the nomination.Others say there is strong support for liberal policy and that these positions would help either candidate in the fall.Final results from Iowa on Tuesday showed the former secretary of state winning 49.9% to Mr. Sanders's 49.6%, or four more state delegates out of more than 1,400 at stake. The race now moves to New Hampshire, which holds its primary this coming Tuesday.Before then, Democrats will have two opportunities to assess their choices--on Wednesday evening at a CNN forum, and on Thursday in what will be the candidates' first one-on-one debate. Late Monday, a third candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, dropped out.When Mrs. Clinton's husband was running for president in 1992, the centrist wing of the Democratic Party was ascendant, with Democrats seeking to shed their image as tax-and-spend liberals and address middle-class concerns. As president, Bill Clinton declared that the ""era of big government"" was over. He signed a welfare overhaul, negotiated a balanced budget and focused on reducing crime, among other things.Since the 1990s, the party has moved to the left on a swath of issues as voter anger over the financial crisis and slow recovery has swelled.Nothing demonstrates the shift more clearly than the rise of Mr. Sanders, a political independent from Vermont who identifies himself as a democratic socialist. Some Democrats worry that the term ""socialist"" would scare off independent voters in a general election. But for many primary voters, it represents a commitment to fight for their causes.""We love Bernie Sanders,"" said Amy Noon, 28 years old, a massage therapist in Iowa City, Iowa. ""He stands for everything we wish the country was and is not. [Mrs. Clinton] stands for everything the country already is.""In Iowa, the party's ""very liberal'' and ""moderate'' wings were equal in size at the Democratic caucuses but had different memberships, surveys taken Monday at caucus sites showed.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* New Risks for Trump After Iowa Loss* Rubio Campaign Sees Opening After Iowa* Cruz Win Chips Away at Ethanol's Clout* Obama, Ryan See Potential for a Tax-Policy Compromise* Sanders's Tax Increases Fall Short of Paying for Health Plan, Analysis FindsCaucusgoers who called themselves ""very liberal'' tended to be younger, and more of them had at least a four-year college degree. Their top issue was income inequality.By contrast, more than half of the self-described moderates were age 60 or older, and 60% of them didn't have a college degree. The economy and jobs were their top issues.The two groups also had different views of the direction the nation should take once President Barack Obama leaves office, with ""very liberal'' caucusgoers saying they wanted the next president to pursue more-liberal policies, and moderates saying they wanted to ""generally continue'' Mr. Obama's course.As her party has changed, Mrs. Clinton has shifted to the left on some issues. In 2008, for instance, she opposed new Social Security taxes on the wealthy; now, she supports them. Her anti-Wall Street rhetoric has risen, too, and she now talks about jailing executives who break the law.Her backers tend to minimize the differences with Mr. Sanders, saying that many of Mrs. Clinton's plans--such as her $350 billion, 10-year college plan--are bold. But Mr. Sanders and his aides see differences in stark terms.""This is a fight for the soul of the Democratic Party,"" Sanders strategist Tad Devine said Tuesday.One clear divide is tactical. Mrs. Clinton regularly warns that trying to enact a single-payer health-care plan, as Mr. Sanders favors, would lead to gridlock and endanger progress made under Mr. Obama's Affordable Care Act. Better to act incrementally to deal with lingering issues, such as high out-of-pocket costs, she has said.Mr. Sanders has said nothing in his agenda will come about without a revolution, but he is vague about how the revolution will come to pass.The two candidates' perspectives differ in two fundamental ways: on their view of the economy, and on their view of how much government is needed to address society's problems.On the role of government, Mr. Sanders wants to expand the suite of benefits offered to all Americans, while Mrs. Clinton favors more targeted ideas. For example, Mr. Sanders would increase Social Security benefits across the board, while Mrs. Clinton wants an increase targeted to the poorest senior citizens. Mr. Sanders would give all Americans government-run health insurance, while Mrs. Clinton wants to patch holes in the Obama health law.Mr. Sanders also wants to make tuition free at public colleges. Mrs. Clinton has a plan that would allow students to attend college without taking on debt, but it wouldn't be free.Many also see a difference in how the candidates see the economy. Mr. Sanders describes the economy as unfairly rigged to favor the rich, while Mrs. Clinton offers a more textured explanation for economic pressures, including the impact of technological change.""Sanders says that the rules are unfair because specific individuals have crafted those rules to their advantage,"" said William Galston, a Brookings Institution scholar who was an adviser in the Bill Clinton White House and now writes an opinion column for The Wall Street Journal. ""The center left is more inclined to give at least equal weight to long-term processes like globalization and technological change in explaining what's going on in the economy.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler",2/3/16

With all precincts reporting, the party's tabulations put Mrs. Clinton's delegate count at 49.8%, to Mr. Sanders's 49.6%.""The results tonight are the closest in Iowa Democratic caucus history,"" said Andy McGuire, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party.Mrs. Clinton declared victory early Tuesday morning after a campaign in which she argued that she is the one who can advance the Democratic agenda, and with a sophisticated ground operation that her campaign began building on the day she announced her candidacy in April. Sen. Sanders, a Vermont independent who attracted large and passionate crowds with his clarion call for a political revolution and an unabashedly liberal agenda, hadn't yet conceded Iowa early Tuesday.After that razor-thin outcome in their first matchup, both candidates came to New Hampshire claiming a jolt of momentum as they prepared to hit the trail. Sanders campaign officials said they had successfully fought to a draw with a formidable opponent.Meantime, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said that ""we believe strongly that we won tonight."" Speaking to reporters after midnight as the Clinton press plane prepared to depart Iowa for New Hampshire, he added: ""Sen.

He drew large, energetic crowds to arenas and a loyal online following, where backers taunted detractors to ""feel the Bern.""Beyond their platforms, the battle was waged over who best turned out their supporters. Mr. Sanders repeatedly warned his large and enthusiastic crowds that he would lose if they didn't show up to caucus.But Mrs. Clinton, after being outmaneuvered in 2008, relied on a network of field staffers and volunteers that her campaign has been building for months. And late Monday, Clinton aides claimed victory, saying there was a big turnout--as Mr. Sanders had hoped for--and yet she still tied him.In Van Meter, about a half-hour to the west, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor and Clinton supporter, marveled at the turnout for his precinct.""My wife got a call at five in the afternoon, asking if she was going to caucus,"" he said.

""This does not seem to be a problem for the Sanders campaign.""Ahead of the balloting, Sanders strategist Tad Devine said, ""We've done what we came to do, which is establish him as a serious candidate.""The Clinton campaign was bracing for a loss in New Hampshire, the state that rescued Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and revived Mrs. Clinton's 2008 effort.""There are a lot of headwinds in New Hampshire,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in an interview, noting that candidates from neighboring states, like Mr. Sanders, have almost always won New Hampshire in recent years.But the campaign feels optimistic looking ahead. Mr. Mook pointed to Mrs. Clinton's strong position in Nevada and South Carolina and in the swath of Southern states that will award a quarter of the delegates at stake on March 1.These states, where the Clinton campaign began organizing last summer, have more nonwhite voters than the states in the first two contests. Mrs. Clinton polls strongly among these voters and would continue to emphasize matters important to African-Americans, including her association with Mr. Obama, gun restrictions and the water crisis in Flint, Mich.The candidates offer Democrats with two very different visions for governing.In speeches that remained almost identical across months of campaigning, Mr. Sanders promised to break up large banks, said Wall Street is built on fraud and unapologetically vowed to impose higher taxes to provide universal health care , free tuition at public colleges and more generous Social Security benefits.

And backers often say she is the most qualified candidate for the presidency they have ever encountered.On Monday night, Deidre Fudge arrived early to her West Des Moines caucus to register support for Mrs. Clinton.""I'm just a little worried about Bernie and his naiveté,"" Ms. Fudge said.

Hillary and Bernie Recall LBJ More Than JFK,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762279862?accountid=12768,"Regarding Edward P. Lazear's ""If Only Hillary and Bernie Would Recall JFK"" (op-ed, Jan. 29): While it is true that individual Americans migrate among all five annual income quintiles, all boats don't move up and down by the same amount in a rising tide.Regarding Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the questions for America include whether they want to limit boating or add a ton of freight to some people's boats, and not allow other vessels to sail during any tide. President John F. Kennedy understood incentives. He understood, 20-plus years before the Laffer curve, that if you want more of something, tax it less. Americans may not be able to handle a president with policies that mandate some boats get torpedoed, while others are allowed to sail on subsidized biofuel.Michael J. Perullo, CPAAtlanta---Mr. Lazear claims President Kennedy believed ""a rising tide lifts all boats."" However, that was only until JFK read ""The Other America,"" Michael Harrington's 1962 expose of the millions of Americans left behind as the country prospered in the post-World War II boom. Afterward, Kennedy immediately directed his Council of Economic Advisers to look into the issue of poverty in America. Chairman Walter Heller and the council concluded that, in fact, a rising tide doesn't lift all boats.Records show that poverty was one of the last things JFK focused on before his assassination, and that he wanted to make it central to his 1964 legislative agenda. Lyndon Johnson took up this charge and launched the War on Poverty, designed to be a hand up -- not a handout -- and lift people out of poverty.Class warfare isn't the answer, but it's about time to realize that it takes a lot more than tax cuts and other incentives for the so-called ""job creators"" to lift today's 50 million Americans out of poverty and revitalize the country's struggling middle class. Now, if only Hillary and Bernie would recall LBJ.Tyler RossChicago---It is a testament to Democratic and media image-making that JFK is remembered primarily for his ""Camelot"" White House and his tragic death, not for his too-brief push for lower-tax, pro-growth, supply-side economic policies. The one stain on JFK's thousand days in the White House was his support of a disastrous attempt to overturn Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba. That failure allowed the Castro brothers to show what happens to an economy that is built on class warfare rather than growth. Many leftist American admirers of Castro are flocking to Cuba before capitalists start renovating the dilapidated buildings in Havana and destroy its 1950s ambience. Cuba's economy needs to cross the bridge to the 1960s before making any leap into the 21st century.Why can't we learn that class war is economic hell for all classes?William HoganSavannah, Ga.---President Kennedy also said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.""The Democratic Party message of 2008, ever more strident now, is: ""The government will see that your needs are met. Someone else will pay for this, and you need not be personally responsible.""

Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.), would hold a debate in Flint on March 6 as a way to draw attention to the contaminated-water issue.Flint has been embroiled in a crisis for months , after the city began taking its drinking water from the Flint River, which caused lead levels to reach dangerous heights . The move was meant to be temporary as the city cut costs by switching from Detroit's water system to another water authority.Rep. Jason Chafftez (R., Utah), chairman of the House oversight committee, said Wednesday he issued subpoenas to two officials to force them to appear at a deposition with committee lawyers regarding Flint's water crisis.More Flint Coverage* Hearings Open on Flint Water Crisis* New Trouble Knocks Flint as Mortgage Firms Require Proof of Safe Water* Detroit Schools' Emergency Manager to Step Down* Lead Levels in Flint Remain Extremely High at Some Locations* State Officials in Flint Got Bottled Water Months Before Warning Not to Drink It* U.S. Cities Scrutinize Water Systems in Wake of Flint* Series of Mistakes Tainted Flint WaterThe committee had invited three officials--Miguel Del Toral, a water official at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; former EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman, who resigned Monday over the crisis; and former Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley--to testify at a hearing Wednesday. It was the first congressional hearing on the crisis since it came to national attention last fall.The three officials declined to appear.Nichole Distefano, an associate administrator at the EPA, told the committee in a letter last week ""it would be highly unusual for the agency to send a non-supervisory regional career staff member"" like Mr. Del Toral to testify before Congress, the letter stated, and Mr. Del Toral was focused on addressing the crisis in Flint.The committee had invited Mr. Del Toral because he wrote a memo to EPA colleagues in June 2015 detailing the high levels of lead in Flint's drinking water. The committee accepted his decision not to testify.However, Mr. Chaffetz said he deployed the subpoenas, which have legal force, to bring Mr. Earley and Ms. Hedman to Washington for a deposition. Whether Mr. Chaffetz would also try to compel them to appear at a public hearing hasn't been decided, according to a panel spokeswoman.An attorney representing Mr. Earley, A. Scott Bolden, said the former emergency manager would be willing to meet with and testify before the committee ""subject to his constitutional rights and subject to any privileges he would enjoy."" Witnesses can choose to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, declining to answer questions, though Mr. Bolden didn't cite that provision in particular.Ms. Hedman, the former EPA regional administrator for Michigan, couldn't be reached for comment.Five other witnesses, including an official from the EPA and the director of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, testified Wednesday.Joel Beauvais, acting deputy assistant administrator for the EPA's office of water, defended his agency's actions before the House committee and said the first responsibility for responding to the crisis fell to state and local governments.Flint also took center stage Wednesday in the Senate debate on an energy bill, as Democrats and Republicans negotiated over a Democratic amendment providing $200 million in direct funds for Flint and as much as $600 million in loans and other financing.""We're looking for some help from the federal government for a problem that was created by the state of Michigan and with thousands of victims,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), the second-ranking Senate Democrat.Republicans said they were concerned about the federal government spending money to tackle a non-federal problem. The Democratic proposal ""puts the cart ahead of the horse in terms of letting local and state government address what is a local and state problem,"" said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), the second-ranking Senate Republican.The issue has at times inflamed political sensitivities. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, has apologized for the crisis, and Democrats have cited it as evidence of GOP neglect of infrastructure and public health. Republicans have framed it as a failure of government more broadly.At the House hearing, members of both parties chiefly criticized the state of Michigan but also chided the EPA for not responding more aggressively when Mr. Del Toral's memo pointed to high levels of lead in Flint's water.The EPA said there is no safe level of exposure to lead, a potent neurotoxin that is especially damaging to children because it harms development of the brain and nervous system.Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents Flint, said at the hearing that Michigan is the main culprit, calling it a ""false equivalence"" to blame city and federal officials as much as the state. ""This was a state failure,"" Mr. Kildee said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, and two EPA divisions are among the agencies working on a broad criminal investigation into the lead contamination of Flint.Write to Amy Harder at amy.harder@wsj.com and Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications: The House Oversight Committee accepted EPA official Miguel Del Toral's decision not to testify and is not issuing a subpoena to require his presence.

""Then she's not a progressive.""Mrs. Clinton hit back at a get-out-the-vote event, calling her opponent's comments a ""low blow"" and saying she has delivered results for progressives. She said the race should focus on issues, but added that ""if it's about our records, hey, I'm going to win by a landslide.""The squabble over which candidate is more progressive ramped up online with a series of tweets from Mr. Sanders's account, including a long list of more moderate policy positions that Mrs. Clinton has taken in the past.Mrs. Clinton's campaign suggested that Mr. Sanders has built-in advantages in New Hampshire because he represents neighboring Vermont. Mr. Sanders parried, saying New Hampshire voters are serious about their role in the nominating process and that ""to repeatedly suggest otherwise is an insult"" to them.Mr. Sanders said on CNN that the Clinton campaign is financed by Wall Street and big-money interests. Mrs. Clinton countered by critiquing her rival's health-care plan.This intensifying tit-for-tat is playing out in a state where Mrs. Clinton is a decided long-shot. A Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Mr. Sanders with an 18-percentage-point advantage in Tuesday's primary, and some have suggested Mrs. Clinton should focus her resources on the states that will vote shortly after New Hampshire.""Not on your life,"" Mrs. Clinton told supporters Wednesday. ""I would never quit on New Hampshire.""The Clinton campaign has tried to lower expectations in recent days, saying that Mrs. Clinton's 2008 come-from-behind win in New Hampshire is unlikely to be replicated. Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton's communications director, said Mr. Sanders has a substantial lead but that the former secretary of state would stay in New Hampshire through the primary, trying to build support.""We don't know that we can win, but she is going to be here every day,"" Ms. Palmieri said.The Sanders campaign pushed back against the Clinton team's attempts to play down her prospects. ""They're overplaying their hand on this 'He's a neighbor' stuff,' "" said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders campaign strategist. ""Our view is we're up against the whole establishment again.""The battle for New Hampshire and the tonal shift in the Democratic campaign come on the heels of a hard-fought contest in Iowa that saw Mrs. Clinton eke out a razor-thin win. The Sanders campaign has framed that outcome as a victory; people close to the Clintons have said they expected a better result.Some Democratic strategists said Mrs. Clinton remains in a stronger position for the long term. With the race soon moving to states with higher percentages of minority voters, Mrs. Clinton stands to do better, they said. Steve McMahon, a longtime Democratic consultant, said the Iowa result ""helped Bernie, but it wasn't enough of a 'Voila!' moment to change the dynamic in South Carolina and Nevada.""""That's what he needed,"" Mr. McMahon said.Although Mr. Sanders didn't come out of Iowa with a win, the result validated his candidacy and demonstrated to the Democratic Party that Mrs. Clinton is hardly invincible, Mr. Devine said.""They'd been hearing that she is way ahead and her nomination has been a foregone conclusion,"" Mr. Devine said. ""Now they're finding that's not the case.""A goal of the Sanders campaign in New Hampshire is to gain momentum and compel Democrats in other states to take a fresh look at the contest, he said. Polls show Mr. Sanders trailing Mrs. Clinton in coming contests in South Carolina and other Southern states with large numbers of African-American voters. He described New Hampshire as a ""moment of acceleration."" Mr. Sanders is telling supporters that the political establishment is growing nervous about his staying power. Winning the nomination won't be easy, the senator said, but he noted that in Iowa he took on the ""most powerful political organization in the country.""For her part, Mrs. Clinton is positioning herself as a fighter, not a front-runner, and is quick to remind voters that she is running against a ""neighbor."" She urges, ""New Hampshire, come with me this week.""Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Peter Nicholas",2/4/16
"Federal Lawmakers Ramp Up Response to Flint Water Crisis; House committee issues subpoenas, Democratic senators seek money, and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders plan debate in city",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762157278?accountid=12768,"Scott Calvert, Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.WASHINGTON--Federal lawmakers Wednesday ratcheted up their response to the water crisis in Flint, Mich., as a House committee subpoenaed government officials and Democratic senators urged that money be set aside to address the problem.The Democratic Party also said its two presidential hopefuls, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.), would hold a debate in Flint on March 6 as a way to draw attention to the contaminated-water issue.Flint has been embroiled in a crisis for months , after the city began taking its drinking water from the Flint River, which caused lead levels to reach dangerous heights . The move was meant to be temporary as the city cut costs by switching from Detroit's water system to another water authority.Rep. Jason Chafftez (R., Utah), chairman of the House oversight committee, said Wednesday he issued subpoenas to two officials to force them to appear at a deposition with committee lawyers regarding Flint's water crisis.More Flint Coverage* Hearings Open on Flint Water Crisis* Detroit Schools' Emergency Manager to Step Down* Lead Levels in Flint Remain Extremely High at Some Locations* State Officials in Flint Got Bottled Water Months Before Warning Not to Drink It* U.S. Cities Scrutinize Water Systems in Wake of Flint* Series of Mistakes Tainted Flint WaterThe committee had invited three officials--Miguel Del Toral, a water official at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; former EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman, who resigned Monday over the crisis; and former Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley--to testify at a hearing Wednesday. It was the first congressional hearing on the crisis since it came to national attention last fall.The three officials declined to appear.Nichole Distefano, an associate administrator at the EPA, told the committee in a letter last week ""it would be highly unusual for the agency to send a non-supervisory regional career staff member"" like Mr. Del Toral to testify before Congress, the letter stated, and Mr. Del Toral was focused on addressing the crisis in Flint.The committee had invited Mr. Del Toral because he wrote a memo to EPA colleagues in June 2015 detailing the high levels of lead in Flint's drinking water. The committee accepted his decision not to testify.However, Mr. Chaffetz said he deployed the subpoenas, which have legal force, to bring Mr. Earley and Ms. Hedman to Washington for a deposition. Whether Mr. Chaffetz would also try to compel them to appear at a public hearing hasn't been decided, according to a panel spokeswoman.An attorney representing Mr. Earley, A. Scott Bolden, said the former emergency manager would be willing to meet with and testify before the committee ""subject to his constitutional rights and subject to any privileges he would enjoy."" Witnesses can choose to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, declining to answer questions, though Mr. Bolden didn't cite that provision in particular.Ms. Hedman, the former EPA regional administrator for Michigan, couldn't be reached for comment.Five other witnesses, including an official from the EPA and the director of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, testified Wednesday.Joel Beauvais, acting deputy assistant administrator for the EPA's office of water, defended his agency's actions before the House committee and said the first responsibility for responding to the crisis fell to state and local governments.Flint also took center stage Wednesday in the Senate debate on an energy bill, as Democrats and Republicans negotiated over a Democratic amendment providing $200 million in direct funds for Flint and as much as $600 million in loans and other financing.""We're looking for some help from the federal government for a problem that was created by the state of Michigan and with thousands of victims,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), the second-ranking Senate Democrat.Republicans said they were concerned about the federal government spending money to tackle a non-federal problem. The Democratic proposal ""puts the cart ahead of the horse in terms of letting local and state government address what is a local and state problem,"" said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), the second-ranking Senate Republican.The issue has at times inflamed political sensitivities. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, has apologized for the crisis, and Democrats have cited it as evidence of GOP neglect of infrastructure and public health. Republicans have framed it as a failure of government more broadly.At the House hearing, members of both parties chiefly criticized the state of Michigan but also chided the EPA for not responding more aggressively when Mr. Del Toral's memo pointed to high levels of lead in Flint's water.The EPA said there is no safe level of exposure to lead, a potent neurotoxin that is especially damaging to children because it harms development of the brain and nervous system.Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents Flint, said at the hearing that Michigan is the main culprit, calling it a ""false equivalence"" to blame city and federal officials as much as the state. ""This was a state failure,"" Mr. Kildee said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, and two EPA divisions are among the agencies working on a broad criminal investigation into the lead contamination of Flint.Write to Amy Harder at amy.harder@wsj.com and Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications: The House Oversight Committee accepted EPA official Miguel Del Toral's decision not to testify and is not issuing a subpoena to require his presence.

Bernie's Big (Last?) Moment; Sanders must start playing to win before he gets rolled by the Clinton machine.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762584741?accountid=12768,"Claremont, N.H.You can hear the whooping from the front door of the city opera house. Two stories up, on Tuesday night, an enormous crowd is packed in to hear Bernie Sanders at his first big event after the Iowa caucuses.It feels like a tent revival meeting. Bernie is keying up his crowd. Every time he brings up the banks, or ""special interests,"" or the ""billionaire class,"" someone in the audience pipes up with a rejoinder, followed by a roar from the crowd. ""You ever heard of Goldman Sachs?"" deadpans the Vermont senator. A voice shouts, ""Hillary has! She goes there!"" The masses scream: ""BOOOOO!!!"" The audience is amped; they love him. This is Bernie's moment.And likely his only one.Farther south, on that same Tuesday, another crowd of Democrats has assembled at Nashua Community College. This one isn't so electric. It looks more . . . determined. Those gathered also love Bernie. They love his ""enthusiasm"" and how ""bold"" he is and his ""truth."" Yet here they are, at a Hillary Clinton rally.Bernie ""is unelectable,"" says Darius Mohsenin, a Democrat from California who has flown all the way here to check out the contenders. ""I like Bernie's message. He's bringing up a lot of third-rail items."" The 56-year-old landlord particularly likes the Vermonter's focus on ""income inequality."" Is Hillary addressing that issue? ""She's hinting at it. It's embedded in her platform, but not as much."" The point is, he says, ""she can win.""Witness the triumph of the Clinton machine. The media are playing up the Iowa results as a Clinton-Sanders ""tie,"" pitching the possibility of a drawn-out fight for the Democratic nomination. In fact, Mrs. Clinton is hitting her stride, making electability a potent anti-Sanders message. She knows that the more voters tune in, the more they realize the stakes. So she's reminding them every chance she can that the White House and Barack Obama's legacy are on the line.That's why Mrs. Clinton is bear-hugging Mr. Obama, promising to protect and expand on his work. It's why she insists that Mr. Sanders's plan for single-payer health care will ""never, ever come to pass""--her way of warning Democrats that Bernie could never, ever get elected. It's why she keeps droning on about ""reality."" It's why the supposedly ""neutral"" Mr. Obama piled on to assure that Hillary could ""govern"" and ""start here, day one, more experienced"" than Bernie.Pundits keep weighing in on Mr. Sanders's demographic problems after New Hampshire, his difficulty attracting black voters in, say, South Carolina. But electability is rapidly becoming the bigger liability. Leading Democrats are now assisting Mrs. Clinton by openly questioning his age, his radicalism, his potential to fracture the party and keep moderate Democrats from the polls. When Mr. Sanders attacks Mrs. Clinton on Twitter as a ""moderate,"" he's helping their argument.Many Democrats are open to this message. They hail from states whose governments in recent years have become dominated by Republicans. They've witnessed the backlash to Mr. Obama's policies, and they know Mr. Sanders makes the current president look tame.And so they are eating their Clinton spinach. Not that they like it. Mr. Sanders promises his passionate crowds a revolution. At the Nashua rally, Bill Clinton by contrast introduces his wife with the leaden promise that she will ""show up every day."" This is the theme of every Hillary campaign: that she's the worker bee, the realist, the survivor. It's meant to be reassuring, but the attendees who are (dutifully) clapping and (dutifully) cheering also look as if they are embarking on a long march. Another Clinton presidency would be a daily grind. But at least it'd be a Democratic grind.The electability line has become so potent that Mr. Sanders is openly trying to refute it. He points to polls that show him faring better against Republicans than Mrs. Clinton. His team points out how much more favorably he is viewed by voters than she. Mr. Sanders even insists that Democrats need him if they want to keep the White House. ""Republicans win,"" he said in Iowa, ""when people become demoralized, when they give up on the political process, and when they don't vote."" His nomination, he promised, would raise excitement and turnout.The only point Mr. Sanders won't make is the one that would be most effective. He refuses to make a case that Mrs. Clinton is unelectable. While the Vermonter has notably sharpened his attacks on Hillary--blasting her ties to big banks--he still refuses to raise the scandal of the FBI investigation into her private email server. He's foregoing a powerful, and honest, argument that Mrs. Clinton remains a huge risk to her party--particularly given how worried many Democrats are about a prosecution, and how little they trust Hillary.This is the story of the Sanders campaign: a continuing reluctance to play to win. The socialist keeps bragging that he's fighting the machine. But he isn't, really. The powers that early on anointed and sanctioned Hillary's candidacy are today undercutting Mr. Sanders, painting him as a modern George McGovern loon. You don't fight that machine with group singalongs. That's why next week's vote in New Hampshire may prove to be the apex of Bernie's career.Write to kim@wsj.com.Credit: By Kimberley A.

How Democrats' Shift to the Left Is Helping Bernie Sanders; Candidate's liberal positions are attracting the young as Socialism loses its sting,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762913994?accountid=12768,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--Then-Sen. Barack Obama had to spend precious days at the close of his 2008 presidential campaign to defend against charges of socialism after he casually suggested his tax plan would ""spread the wealth around.""Today, seeking the same job in the same party, Sen. Bernie Sanders proudly wears the democratic socialist label and touts a sweeping plan designed to spread the wealth. He calls for a ""political revolution"" to vastly expand the government's role in American life and sharply cut the power of Wall Street and the role of money in politics. And he draws voters too young to care about socialism's Cold War stigma and who came of age during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.Mr. Sanders, so liberal he resisted joining the Democratic Party for decades, hasn't changed his views since his first election to office 35 years ago. Yet he now represents a substantial swath of his party's left flank.What has changed is the Democratic Party, whose voters have moved to the left over the course of both Republican and Democratic administrations, and, like the Republican Party, are responding to a rising populist tide.A major shiftMr. Sanders's proposals amount to a more significant expansion of government than any viable presidential candidate has proposed in years, supported by more new spending than many Democrats would like.Three ideas in particular--on Social Security, college subsidies and health care--show how his thinking and the party's most liberal voters have aligned.On Social Security, Mr. Sanders, age 74, wants to increase benefits for everyone, a position barely discussed a few years ago, as most Democrats focused on maintaining the program's long-term solvency and defending it from Republican privatization proposals.More on Election 2016* Hollywood Enthusiasm, If Not Money, Flows to Sanders* Clinton Takes Campaign Detour to Meet Flint Voters* GOP Rivals Make Late New Hampshire Push* Rubio Aims to Move Past Debate Setback* Christie Works to Build on His Debate PerformanceOn college, he proposes a $750 billion program to make tuition free at all public colleges and universities--paid for by a new tax on financial transactions.And on health care, Mr. Sanders wants to go far beyond the Affordable Care Act by replacing private insurance companies with government-run coverage. Here, he speaks for many liberals who have long supported a universal, single-payer health-care system but haven't seriously pushed it in years.All three proposals would require congressional approval, considered highly unlikely with the current GOP majority. Mr. Sanders says a political revolution is needed to pressure lawmakers.Socialism appears to carry far less of a stigma than it once did, particularly among young people who form the base of Mr. Sanders's support. A Boston Globe poll of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire released Saturday found 31% said the term ""socialist"" described them; among those ages 17 to 34, it was just over half.In the Iowa caucuses, voters under age 30 supported Mr. Sanders over rival Hillary Clinton, 84% to 14%.Growth of the party's left wing has taken a toll on Mrs. Clinton, who for years was tagged as an ultra-liberal but must now prove her credentials as a progressive and explain her long ties to Wall Street. Mrs. Clinton narrowly won the Iowa caucuses last week, and now trails in polls ahead of the primary Tuesday in New Hampshire, which borders Mr. Sanders's home state of Vermont. Nationally, she is first in polls.Mrs. Clinton's campaign proposals are less sweeping and less expensive, though she argues they are more effective and far more realistic in an era of wide ideological divisions.Mr. Sanders's surprising success--and Mrs. Clinton's travails--highlight how far the party has moved leftward since her husband, former President Bill Clinton, steered it to the center in the early 1990s.The Republican Party, meanwhile, has veered to the right.Polls illustrate the shift in both parties. In 1990, just 13% of Democrats called themselves ""very liberal,"" while 12% of Republicans identified as ""very conservative,"" according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. By last year the number was 26% for Democrats and 29% for Republicans.When Mr. Clinton was elected president in 1992, Democrats were coming off 12 years of Republican control of the White House, and many in the party were determined to show voters they were tough on crime, friendly to business, concerned about the federal budget and careful with taxpayer money. Mr. Clinton was chief spokesman for the party's centrist agenda.""It was considered good politics for Democrats to show people on Wall Street approved of their economic plans,"" said Peter Beinart, who has studied the evolution of the Democratic Party at the City University of New York. ""In the 1990s, Wall Street had a lot of prestige.""President George W. Bush's election in 2000 sparked a revival of the Democratic Party's left wing: His tax plan, for example, yielded significant cuts for the wealthy, and, in 2002, he won congressional approval to invade Iraq.Both measures passed with the help of Democratic lawmakers, stirring fury among liberal Democrats, who found new outlets for their anger--from the liberal blog Daily Kos and MoveOn.org to the presidential campaign of Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who ran in 2004 against the war and the tax cuts.The seeds of a progressive movement inside the party appeared to flower with Mr. Obama's 2008 election, but many liberals soon chafed. On health care, Mr. Obama failed to secure a government-run option to compete with private insurance companies in the new insurance marketplaces, they complained. The president enraged many liberals when he suggested he was willing to cut Social Security benefits to win a grand budget bargain in 2011.Such swelling voices served as the backdrop for Mr. Sanders's suggestion that a candidate on the left challenge Mr. Obama in the 2012 election.""There are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president; who believe that, with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president,"" Mr. Sanders told a radio interviewer in 2011.The party was also becoming more liberal as conservative Democrats were defeated or retired, and Republican lawmakers took hold of the South. The shift left the Democratic base concentrated in the Northeast, upper Midwest and West Coast, reliant on a more liberal voting bloc compared with the working-class white voters who once formed an important party foundation.Anger mounted during the Obama years over growing income inequality, particularly after Wall Street bailouts rescued some of the country's richest people while many Americans struggled financially in a tepid job market.Statistics explain voter fury. The top 3% of households had more than twice as much wealth in 2013 as the bottom 90% put together, according to the Federal Reserve. The top 400 taxpayers' share of U.S. income doubled in two decades, according to the Internal Revenue Service. While top incomes rose, every other group was stagnant.Much like the tea party, which grew out of anger on the political right over Wall Street bailouts, anger on the left surfaced in the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests. The movement fizzled, but not before raising income inequality to national debate.In 2011, Elizabeth Warren, a formerly obscure Harvard bankruptcy professor, became a national sensation on the left by challenging wealthy Americans to recognize that public investment--in roads and education, for example--helped enable their success. ""There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody,"" she said, in an oft-repeated quote.Ms. Warren was elected to the Senate in 2012, and her supporters later urged her to run for president in 2016. She declined, but Mr. Sanders picked up many of her supporters and then some.The Occupy Wall Street movement opened the door for Sen. Warren, who paved the way for Sen. Sanders, said Jeremy Varon, a history professor at the New School in New York, who has studied the movement.""Here's a guy who owns the label of socialist. It's inconceivable that a major candidate would have done that prior to Occupy,"" Mr. Varon said. ""Occupy gave a new prestige to a set of ideas that were normally considered quite marginal.""As a candidate, Mr. Sanders's proposals would cost some $17 trillion over 10 years, according to his campaign, which amounts to a one-third increase in the total size of government and the largest peacetime expansion in modern U.S. history.'Medicare for all'His most expensive proposal, about $1.4 trillion annually, is for a ""Medicare for all"" government-financed health care system, which he said was needed to ensure all Americans have affordable health coverage and to control costs. His plan would disconnect health insurance from employment; businesses and individuals would no longer pay premiums.Mr. Sanders said he would pay for the plan with a new 6.2% payroll tax on employers, a 2.2% income tax on all taxpayers and new taxes on high-income households. Under Mr. Sanders's plan, the top federal income-tax rate would exceed 50% for the first time since 1980.The last Democratic presidential candidate to propose a single-payer health care program was California Gov. Jerry Brown in 1992. Yet support for the idea dates back decades. More than 60 House Democrats currently back single-payer legislation.Social Security provides way too little for retirement, Mr. Sanders said, citing elderly people trying to get by on payments of $12,000 or so a year. He would increase benefits and pay for them, he said, applying the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax--paid by employers and employees--on income over $250,000. The tax is currently applied only to the first $118,500 of wages.His proposal would have been jarring until recently. Democrats opposed GOP efforts to privatize the program, but few talked about expanding the program. Democrats focused on the issue typically worried about the program's long-term shortfall, and hoped for a bipartisan agreement to bolster the program, likely a combination of higher taxes and reduced benefits.Mr. Obama proposed a small benefit cut during the 2011 budget negotiations, prompting an outcry from the left. The idea sank, but liberals concluded their best defense against cuts was a good offense: They began advocating for benefit increases.Now, a group favoring expanded benefits counts 141 Democratic House members supporting their cause, and, in the Senate, 42 Democrats voted for a nonbinding resolution calling for a ""sustainable expansion of benefits.""Mrs. Clinton has long said she supported increased benefits for the poorest seniors. But on Friday, Mr. Sanders pressured Mrs. Clinton to say whether she would promise not to cut the program. In response, she tweeted, ""I won't cut Social Security. As always, I'll expand it, & I'll defend it.""Mr. Sanders's proposal to eliminate tuition at public colleges has gained steam at a time when many students face heavy debt loads--now approaching $1.3 trillion, nationally--and state budget cuts to higher education have driven up tuition. The recession prompted many people to go back to school, and many emerged with heavy payments and few prospects.As recently as 2012, Mr. Obama proposed more modest assistance to college students: lowering rates on federal loans, which he pushed among younger voters during his re-election campaign. Last year, he proposed tuition-free community college, an idea that died in Congress.Liberal groups pitched something bolder: debt-free four-year college, which charged families only what they could afford. Mrs. Clinton backed that idea, but Mr. Sanders took it further and proposed free college altogether. Public college should be free, he said, like high school is.""In the last 30 years, when people say to me, 'Bernie you're coming up with these ambitious ideas. How can you afford them?'"" Mr. Sanders told the crowd at a campaign rally Sunday. ""The answer is in the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the pockets of working families to the top 1/10th of 1%. And we can afford these programs because we're going to transfer some of that wealth back.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Richard Rubin",2/8/16
The Windmills of Bernie's Mind; Sen. Sanders better check with his Vermont constituents about the popularity of wind energy.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762907212?accountid=12768,"Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders in December introduced a sweeping renewable-energy plan that would, among other things, require tens of thousands of new wind turbines. Sen. Sanders's ""people before polluters"" proposal may help rally his followers, but it won't be so well received in rural America, where resistance to wind farms has been building. Nowhere is the backlash stronger than in Mr. Sanders's state.On Jan. 5, Vermont state Sens. John S. Rodgers and Robert Starr, both Democrats, introduced a bill (S. 210 ) that would ban wind projects above 500 kilowatts (an average industrial wind turbine has a capacity of 1.5 megawatts or more). Twenty-four co-sponsors filed an identical bill in Vermont's lower chamber on Jan. 20.Mr. Rodgers called the growing resistance to wind projects ""a rebellion"" at a news conference in Montpelier, the state capital. ""I know of no place in the state where we can place industrial wind turbines without creating an unacceptable level of damage to our environment and our people.""Wind-generated electricity in the U.S. has more than tripled since 2008, but opposition to the gigantic turbines, which can stand more than 500 feet, has been growing. In Vermont several protesters were arrested in 2011 and 2012 while trying to stop work on a wind project built on top of Lowell Mountain.In March 2015 the Northeastern Vermont Development Association, a regional planning commission that covers 21% of the state's land area, voted unanimously in favor of a resolution that said ""no further development of industrial-scale wind turbines should take place in the Northeast Kingdom.""In October residents of Irasburg overwhelmingly voted down, 274-9, a proposed five-megawatt wind project near their town. In November residents of Swanton met to consider a seven-turbine wind project proposed to be built atop nearby Rocky Ridge. The tally: 731 votes against, 160 in favor. And in December the town select board in Fairfield , a few miles southeast of Swanton, declared its opposition to the same project.Mr. Sanders's target is for the U.S. to get 80% of its energy from renewables by 2050. The plan calls for 25% of Vermont's energy needs to be produced from wind--a giant expansion. In 2014, according to the American Wind Energy Association, Vermont's 119 megawatts of installed turbine capacity generated about 4% of the electricity produced in the state.Vermont's bill appears to be the first effort by state legislators to outright ban large wind projects, but dozens of governmental entities have rejected or restricted such developments over the past year. In May 2015 commissioners in Stark County, N.D., rejected a $250 million wind project being pushed by Florida-based NextEra Energy, America's biggest wind-energy producer.In July the town board of Somerset , N.Y., voted to oppose a proposed 200-megawatt project known as Lighthouse Wind. And the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a ban on large wind turbines in the county's unincorporated areas.""Wind turbines create visual blight,"" said Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. Skyscraper-size turbines, he added, would ""contradict the county's rural dark skies ordinance which aims to protect dark skies in areas like Antelope Valley and the Santa Monica Mountains.""In Iowa, a three-turbine wind project pushed by a company called Optimum Renewables has been rejected by three different counties , most recently in August by the Black Hawk County Board of Adjustment, after more than 100 local residents expressed concerns.And in December Maine's Partnership for the Preservation of the Downeast Lakes Watershed, a tiny group that had been fighting a $100 million, 40-megawatt project known as Bowers Wind, prevailed when the Maine Supreme Judicial Court upheld a ruling by the state's Board of Environmental Protection, which had previously rejected the project.Why are so many Vermonters opposed to wind energy? The Sanders presidential campaign did not respond to questions. But Sen. Rodgers told me by email that the state must protect its tourism industry. ""People come here from around the world for our scenic vistas and rural working landscape."" Asked whether concerns about climate change should trump the concerns of rural communities, Mr. Rodgers was frank: ""Destroying the natural environment in the name of climate change is moronic.""Mr. Bryce is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

"Hollywood Enthusiasm, If Not Money, Flows to Bernie Sanders; Many in the entertainment industry back the upstart candidate, but Clinton still leads in fundraising",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762906350?accountid=12768,"Brody Mullins and Hannah Karp contributed to this article.LOS ANGELES--Hillary Clinton has richer Hollywood friends, but Bernie Sanders's entertainment-industry supporters are doing what they can to help him win the Democratic presidential nomination.Late last month at the Laugh Factory on the Sunset Strip, a lineup of comedians performed at a fundraiser for Mr. Sanders before a packed audience that included many younger people, a core constituency for the 74-year-old. The event generated a fresh batch of mostly small donations, which has become a bedrock of the insurgent candidacy. The Sanders campaign wouldn't disclose the amount raised from the show, which was streamed online.Mr. Sanders's enthusiastic support among some Hollywood celebrities mirrors the chord he has struck with liberals and younger voters elsewhere. Iowa entrance poll results showed the Vermont senator won 84% of voters under 30. Among those between the ages of 30 and 44, he had 58% support, compared with 37% for Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton managed to eke out a win in Iowa, but the Sanders campaign is relying on similar lopsided margins of support among young voters to help him in New Hampshire on Tuesday. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released last week shows him with the support of 76% of likely Democratic voters 30 and younger.California's primary is deep in the primary calendar, but campaign cash raised here will help Mr. Sanders stay in the race when the terrain shifts to Southern states thought to be more favorable for Mrs. Clinton. In January, Mr. Sanders collected more campaign cash that the party front-runner for the first time. On Friday, the Red Hot Chili Peppers headlined a Los Angeles fundraiser concert for the Sander's campaign.One of the Laugh Factory performers, Sarah Silverman, said she sees parallels between Mr. Sanders and President Barack Obama, whom she supported in 2008 against Mrs. Clinton.Though Mr. Obama is a ""cool-as-a-cucumber speaker"" and ""Bernie has more of a cranky old man vibe,"" she said, ""their spirits are similar in that they engage the people.""Comedian Margaret Cho, who has left Mrs. Clinton's camp for both Mr. Obama in 2008 and for Mr. Sanders this year, expressed similar sentiments.""I saw something different and something more exciting"" in Mr. Sanders, she said.However, Mr. Sanders hasn't yet shown Mr. Obama's ability to peel away Hollywood heavy hitters, whose ties to the Clinton camp in some cases go back to Bill Clinton's presidency.Mr. Obama, in an early coup, won away two top industry figures, DreamWorks Animation SKG Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and billionaire music mogul David Geffen, on his way to upsetting Mrs. Clinton.This year, Mr. Katzenberg is firmly back in the Clinton column, having given $1 million to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing her candidacy.In a recent interview, Mr. Katzenberg said some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters were getting nervous about Mr. Sanders's challenge, but he remains confident she will win the nomination.""This is the time when everyone gets anxious,"" he said. ""And I'm not.""Mr. Geffen, who in 2007 publicly accused the Clintons of being liars, has given each of the two candidates $2,700, the maximum amount an individual can donate directly to a candidate's primary campaign.""I am not supporting anybody,"" he said in an email.In all, more Hollywood money is going to support Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Sanders, and it isn't close.Federal election data through the end of 2015 tracked by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics shows the former senator and secretary of state's campaign received nearly $1.9 million from donors in the movie, television and music industries. Mr. Sanders had received $219,000.The comparison is even more lopsided when counting money for super PACs, or independent political-action committees, which Mr. Sanders has eschewed. Priorities USA Action has received $9 million from the entertainment industry. Haim Saban, head of Saban Capital and a longtime television producer and executive, and his wife, Cheryl, gave $5 million. Director Steven Spielberg and Legendary Entertainment Chief Thomas Tull each contributed $1 million, as did J.J. Abrams, director of the recent ""Star Wars"" blockbuster, with his wife, Kathleen McGrath.Still, Mr. Sanders has been finding other sources of money. In last year's fourth quarter, his campaign raised $33.6 million, compared with $37.4 million by Mrs. Clinton's.Donations at events like the January Laugh Factory fundraiser--coming from people in the audience or those watching online--likely wouldn't show up in any entertainment-industry-related tally if the people worked in other occupations. Such events showcase the ability of celebrities to raise cash for campaigns even when the money isn't their own.Laugh Factory founder Jamie Masada said the Sanders event was the first presidential fundraiser his club has hosted since it opened in 1979. He is looking at doing another Sanders fundraiser using Latino comedians to target that segment of the electorate.Several of Mr. Sanders's Hollywood supporters have big social-media followings among younger voters. They include actor Ryan Gosling, actor and singer Ezra Miller and rapper Michael ""Killer Mike"" Render.Mr. Render, who has been on the campaign trail for Mr. Sanders, has been an outspoken voice in the Black Lives Matter movement, a particularly helpful asset for a candidate who has been trailing Mrs. Clinton in polling among black voters.To be sure, Mrs. Clinton has also attracted some Hollywood heavy hitters with youth appeal, such as singer Katy Perry and actress Lena Dunham. But so far, the young appear mostly to belong to Mr. Sanders, as evidenced by the Laugh Factory event.Among the under-30 crowd at the event was Amber Lynn Blomgren, a 28-year-old local arts promoter who came dressed as the candidate, including a ""Mad Scientist"" wig restyled to emulate the candidate's unruly white hair. She said she could relate to his concerns about income inequality.""We're creators here, and a lot of us are severely underpaid,"" Ms. Blomgren said.Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com and John R.

"Clinton and Sanders Spar Over Progressive Credentials, Wall Street; Candidates clash in first one-on-one debate five days ahead of New Hampshire primary",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762593301?accountid=12768,"Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.DURHAM, N.H.--The Democratic presidential candidates clashed fiercely Thursday night in their first one-on-one debate over who is the true liberal in the race, with Hillary Clinton saying rival Bernie Sanders has put forward an unrealistic agenda that would ultimately collapse.Mrs. Clinton spent much of the first hour defending her record, ideologically and in practice. At one point, she called Mr. Sanders's ""insinuation"" that Wall Street donations mean she won't be a tough monitor of risky bank practices an ""artful smear.""A combative tone was set early on when Mrs. Clinton pushed back on Mr. Sanders's claim that she isn't a true ""progressive.""Read More on Capital Journal* Sanders Maintains Big Lead in New Hampshire, WSJ Poll Says* Clinton's January Fundraising Lagged Behind Sanders* Hillary Clinton's Wall Street Dilemma* Some New Hampshire Voters Question Trump's Latest Moves* Americans Say GOP Favors Rich, But Doubt Either Party Can Help Middle Class--PollThe Vermont senator said Mrs. Clinton has at times described herself as a ""moderate"" who has a more incremental approach to solving economic problems that require bold action.The debate came five days before the primary in New Hampshire, where polls show Mr. Sanders maintains a comfortable lead. The fifth debate in the Democratic contest was also the first to feature just the two leading candidates. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley dropped out of the race Monday after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses.The exchanges were testy, as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders sparred over plans to improve the nation's health-care system, shore up the middle class, and the influence of Wall Street political donations.Mr. Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, noted in a stream of tweets on Wednesday that a genuine progressive wouldn't take millions of dollars in Wall Street donations, as Mrs. Clinton has done.He noted that in a campaign event last fall in Ohio, Mrs. Clinton said that ""I plead guilty"" to ""being kind of moderate and center.""In the debate, Mrs. Clinton chided him for ""cherry-picking"" quotes she had given for political advantage, noting that more often she says she is a progressive who wants to get things done.She also accused Mr. Sanders of being the ""self-proclaimed gatekeeper of progressivism."" She said few Democrats would meet the standard he has set, including President Barack Obama who, she noted, also accepted campaign money from Wall Street.""A progressive is someone who makes progress and that's what I intend to do,"" she said. She also said that under Mr. Sanders's definition, Vice President Joe Biden wouldn't be considered a progressive.Mr. Biden's support for the Keystone XL pipeline would disqualify him--a statement that appears at odds with what is known about the vice president's views. The Obama administration rejected the pipeline last year, and as early as 2013, Mr. Biden reportedly told a supporter he opposed Keystone.Though the candidates' are now vying to win New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton showed she is also keeping an eye on South Carolina and other states with large African-American populations. She injected the issue of race into the debate from the start, saying the issue of discrimination needs to be considered alongside the economic and campaign finance issues that Mr. Sanders focuses much of his attention.""Yes of course we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.""After weeks in which Mr. Sanders has suggested that Mrs. Clinton is compromised because of Wall Street contributions and speaking fees, Mrs. Clinton hit back hard.""Enough is enough. If you've got something to say, say it directly,"" she said. ""But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.""She added that she is proud of the job she's done representing her constituents. ""I think it's time to end a very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks,"" she said.Mr. Sanders replied by speaking in general of contributions from pharmaceutical companies and oil companies, saying they get their way in Congress because of their donations. But he didn't cite anything in Mrs. Clinton's record.""There is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system,"" he said. ""It is undermining American democracy.""Mrs. Clinton replied that she's the one who is being attacked by special interests, in the past and during this campaign, and noted that she's introduced a comprehensive plan to change the way campaigns are financed.""Today hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove are running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you,"" she said.After stumbling earlier this week in explaining why she accepted $675,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, Mrs. Clinton addressed the issue again on Thursday.During a town hall event a day earlier, Mrs. Clinton said she took the sum because ""that's what they offered."" At the debate, the former secretary of state said she went to Wall Street before the financial crash and warned that they were ""going to wreck the economy.Credit: By Peter Nicholas, Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",2/8/16
WSJ Poll: Bernie Sanders Maintains Big Lead in New Hampshire; Survey taken after Iowa caucuses finds that Vermont senator leads Hillary Clinton 58% to 38%,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762545092?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has a commanding and stable lead over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire ahead of the Tuesday's Democratic primary, enjoying a 20-point edge that budged little after Iowa's closely contested caucuses, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds.Powered by lopsided support among millennials, Mr. Sanders is the first choice of 58% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, compared with 38% who favored Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* What Clinton, Sanders Must Do in Tonight's Debate* New Hampshire Make-or-Break for Several Republicans* Santorum Won't Name Single Rubio Feat in Senate (Hint: Think 'Immigration')* Ted Cruz Says Voters Don't Want Attacks--Then Takes Aim at Donald Trump* Rivals Step Up Attacks on RubioThat is about the same as the 57%-38% lead Mr. Sanders had in a Journal/NBC/Marist poll taken in New Hampshire last week, before the two candidates fought to a near draw Monday in Iowa's caucuses.The poll, conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, suggests that neither candidate gained any bounce from the results in Iowa, where Mrs. Clinton won by a fraction of a percentage point. Mr. Sanders portrayed the near-tie as a victory for his underdog campaign.The New Hampshire survey illustrates the huge advantage Mr. Sanders enjoys in the state that neighbors his Vermont home. A looming question is whether a victory in the Granite State would be Mr. Sanders' high-water mark, never to be matched again, or a springboard to gains in less-hospitable states that follow.The two states that hold nominating contests after New Hampshire--South Carolina and Nevada--include far larger shares of minority voters, who in opinion surveys support Mrs. Clinton by large margins.""So far in New Hampshire, it's all Sanders, as Clinton faces an uphill fight,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion.The poll found that Mr. Sanders leads Mrs. Clinton among almost all key voting groups in New Hampshire, especially the young. Among likely voters under age 30, Mr. Sanders is supported by 76%, while Mrs. Clinton has 24%.Mr. Sanders leads even among young women, a cornerstone of the coalition Mrs. Clinton is seeking to build. He has support from 64% of women under age 45, while Mrs. Clinton has 35%. Among women over 45, Mrs. Clinton leads by 9 points.Independents are especially important in New Hampshire, because voters with no party affiliation can decide on Election Day to participate in either party's primary. Among independents who say they are likely to vote in the Democratic primary, Mr. Sanders leads 69% to 26%. Among primary voters who identify themselves as Democrats, his lead is narrower, 51% to 46%.Mrs. Clinton's supporters have said Mr. Sanders is likely to win New Hampshire and are hoping to keep her margin of defeat to single digits. The Clinton camp is banking on a much stronger finish Feb. 20 in South Carolina, where the electorate is more diverse and the large share of African-American voters likely gives Mrs. Clinton an advantage. Among the Democratic primary voters in the New Hampshire poll, less than 1% were black and 1% were Latino.There aren't a lot of fence-sitters left for the candidates to persuade in New Hampshire, the poll found. Among those who say they are likely to vote in the Democratic primary, only 3% are undecided, and 6% say they might change their mind about their candidate preferenceOverall, 79% of likely Democratic primary voters with a candidate preference said they strongly supported their choices. Among those who prefer Mrs. Clinton, 80% say they strongly support her; among Sanders backers, 77% express that high level of support.The Journal/NBC/Marist survey included 567 likely Democratic voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.comCredit: By Janet Hook",2/8/16
President Obama's Cybersecurity Plan; Plus a response to the Bernie Sanders fraud claim.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763634167?accountid=12768,"President Obama announces today in the Journal a new ""Cybersecurity National Action Plan,"" backed by his proposal ""to increase federal cybersecurity funding by more than a third, to over $19 billion."" The goal is to provide ""every American a basic level of online security"" and includes a $3 billion fund to ""kick-start an overhaul"" of federal computer systems. ""It is no secret that too often government IT is like an Atari game in an Xbox world. The Social Security Administration uses systems and code from the 1960s,"" notes Mr. Obama .The President also says he's creating a new federal position, Chief Information Security Officer, and adds that his administration is ""strengthening our partnerships with the private sector to deter, detect and disrupt threats, including to the nation's critical infrastructure.""Morning Editorial ReportClick here to receive WSJ Opinion headlines and commentary via email.The Journal's Bret Stephens takes on Bernie Sanders' claim that ""the business model of Wall Street is fraud."" Mr. Stephens writes , ""Some six million people work in financial services in America, according to Commerce Department figures. Take only the securities and investment end of the business, and you're still talking about 900,000 people , a population that considerably exceeds Vermont's 626,000. Is Mr. Sanders suggesting that some large proportion of those 900,000 is in on the fraud; that every man among them is a Madoff?"" Mr. Stephens adds that the Vermont Senator is ""the sort of man whose notion of wisdom is to hold fast to the angry convictions of his adolescence. That may be why he connects with so many younger voters. But it's also why his moral judgments are so sweeping and juvenile .""And then there's Bernie Sanders' opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination. A Journal editorial notes today that ""Hillary Clinton has made gender a major part of her pitch for the White House, and the idea is catching on. A leading candidate to become the next Secretary-General of the United Nations is a Bulgarian woman with a Communist past and a record unfriendly to U.S. interests who is being promoted by Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law .""As for the Republicans, our columnist William McGurn says that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are ""counting on Donald Trump's implosion somewhere along the line , whether it's because voters tire of his outbursts or realize, as Saturday night's mini-debate over eminent domain illuminated, that his concept of American greatness may be far closer to crony capitalism than to traditional conservatism .""The Bank of Japan is the latest major central bank to announce negative interest rates. ""Reducing interest rates is supposed to increase spending and investment, spurring growth. It won't work,"" writes former St. Louis Fed President William Poole . ""Negative central-bank interest rates will not create growth any more than the Federal Reserve's near-zero interest rates did in the U.S. And it will divert attention from the structural problems that have plagued growth here, as well as in Europe and Japan, and how these problems can be solved."" Mr. Poole recommends instead that Congress instruct Fed economists to study and report on the impact of tax and regulatory burdens on U.S. growth.""The reason so much campaign spending is routed through Super Pacs is that Congress continues to maintain limits on how much individuals can give to candidates. This means billionaires like Mr. Trump can self-fund their campaigns, but the committees of non-rich candidates can't raise more than $2,700 from any single donor,"" notes a Journal editorial . ""Congress could fix the mess by repealing the 2002 McCain-Feingold law , lifting all donation limits and letting candidates collect the cash they need from any American donors in any amounts.""The National Association of Scholars notes problems with college reading lists for incoming freshmen: ""The emphasis on fostering non-academic values such as community, civic engagement, and social justice leads to selecting books that emphasize collective effort for non-academic pursuits rather than the solitary disengagement that is a fundamental component and delight of the life of the mind. College, this sort of common reading tells the incoming student, is a place to indulge a jolly, earnest desire to change the world for the better --and nothing more.""Credit: By James Freeman",2/9/16
"Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders Make Closing Arguments in New Hampshire; Both sides are bracing for a protracted Democratic primary fight",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763236916?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H.--Facing a likely loss in Tuesday's New Hampshire Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton made her final appeal by sketching an optimistic vision for the future and speaking directly to young voters who have yet to embrace her campaign.""To all of the young people who are supporting my opponent, I thank you too--I thank you for being part of this process,"" Mrs. Clinton said in Manchester. ""You may not support me now, but I will always support you.""Meanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who holds a solid lead in public opinion polls in the state, hammered home his themes of eliminating college tuition and the power of special interests in politics.""Are you guys ready for a radical idea? Together we are going to create an economy that works for working families, not just the top 1%,"" he said at a Manchester event.After Mrs. Clinton's razor-thin victory in Iowa last week, both sides are well funded and bracing for a protracted primary campaign that few would have predicted just six months ago. Following New Hampshire, the race moves to friendlier terrain for Mrs. Clinton in the South, but before that, she began testing new messages and laying groundwork for the coming contests.Noting the palpable frustration in the electorate, she told voters: ""Anger is not a plan, and venting is not a strategy.""She spoke in recent days about the travails of being a woman in politics, saying she has a narrower path to walk, and reflected on the challenges of dealing with personal issues while living a very public life. And Mrs. Clinton etched out a hopeful entreaty, asking supporters to envision a better America and asserting that her pragmatic approach would deliver the change they are seeking.""For me this election is a turning-point election in so many ways,"" she said. ""I want you to imagine with me what it is we are trying to accomplish together.""Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, stuck to the message that has taken him this far: a full-throated denunciation of big money in politics, Wall Street and income inequality. ""Is that what America is supposed to be about?"" he asked at one of four New Hampshire events Monday.""No!"" shouted someone from the theater seats.""I don't think so,"" Mr. Sanders agreed.He asked people in the audience to share their student debt load and their health-care deductibles to provide evidence that his plans for free college tuition and government-funded health care are both urgently needed. He also mocked people who call his ideas ""radical.""Both campaigns have worked to manage expectations in recent days. The Sanders team predicted a close race, and the Clinton campaign argued that Mr. Sanders held an almost-insurmountable advantage because he hails from a neighboring state.Related Coverage* Clinton Camp Looks Ahead to Tough Caucus Fights* Clinton Takes Campaign Detour to Meet Flint Voters* Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright's Exhortation to Women to Back ClintonNew Hampshire has been welcoming territory for the Clintons in the past. Bill Clinton declared himself the ""comeback kid"" after finishing second in the 1992 primary. And Mrs. Clinton's come-from-behind-win in 2008 revived her campaign after a third-place finish in Iowa.On Monday, Mrs. Clinton denied reports that she was considering a staff shake-up in the wake of what are likely to be disappointing results in the first two contests.""We're going to take stock, but it's going to be the campaign that I've got,"" she said in an interview with MSNBC.The question is whether the Vermont senator could parlay a primary win here into momentum elsewhere as the campaign moves to Nevada and South Carolina, where minority voters make up a much larger share of the electorate. Polling shows Mrs. Clinton well ahead with both African-Americans and Latinos.""The more people get to know Bernie, the better they like him,"" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said Monday. ""Coming off a virtual tie in Iowa and, knock on wood, a win here, will give us a strong shot. I'm not sure it changes the odds altogether, but it's going to make things different.""Mrs. Clinton has begun to position herself for future contests with a quick trip Sunday to Flint, Mich., to address the water crisis in the majority-African-American city. Her message at times, though, was overshadowed in recent days by controversial statements from some of her strongest supporters.Gloria Steinem, the feminist writer and organizer, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright both drew criticism for separate comments that appeared to rebuke young women for supporting Mr. Sanders. On Sunday, Mr. Clinton grabbed a share of the spotlight when he delivered an extended and aggressive attack on the Vermont senator. The former president cast Mr. Sanders as a hypocrite and a dishonest politician and criticized the senator's supporters for launching profane and sexist attacks on Mrs. Clinton and her backers.At a Clinton event, Ms. Albright said ""there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other,"" a line she has used for some time. In an interview with comedian Bill Maher, Ms. Steinem suggested that younger women were gravitating toward Mr. Sanders in an effort to meet men.By Monday, the former president's public remarks had been toned down, with only a brief critique of Mr. Sanders's assertion that the former secretary of state is part of ""the establishment.""""I have to be careful of what I say,"" Mr. Clinton said in Manchester.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson And Laura Meckler",2/9/16
Bernie's Wall Street Slander; The Vermont socialist preaches class hatred to crowds besotted by the politics of envy.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763236862?accountid=12768,"Last Friday a crane collapsed in lower Manhattan, killing a man named David Wichs. The next day the papers told the story of his life: a Jewish immigrant from Czechoslovakia; a math whiz with a degree from Harvard; a thoughtful neighbor and husband; ""the nicest, most trustworthy person that I have known,"" according to his boss, Mark Gorton, of Tower Research Capital. Mr. Wichs was just 38 when he died.I never met Mr. Wichs, but reading about him reminded me of so many people I know in his industry--prodigiously bright and slyly funny, reasonably wealthy but rarely ostentatious, family men of the type who show up at school auctions and United Jewish Appeal dinners. Maybe they voted for Barack Obama the first time, probably not the second. They're the people who, even now, make American finance the envy of the world.They're the most demonized people in America.That's the import of Bernie Sanders's remark, in his debate last week with Hillary Clinton, that ""the business model of Wall Street is fraud."" The senator from Vermont went on to say that ""corruption is rampant"" in the financial sector, his evidence being that ""major bank after major bank has reached multibillion settlements"" with the feds.This wasn't the first time Mr. Sanders has accused Wall Street of fraud, and it surely won't be the last. No political or social penalties attach, in today's America, to the wholesale indictment of this entire industry and the people who work in it. Had another presidential candidate made a similarly damning remark about some other profession--public-school teachers, say, or oil-rig workers--there would have been the usual outcry about false stereotypes, the decline of civility and so on. When Bernie says it about Wall Street there's a collective shrug, if not nodding agreement.Some six million people work in financial services in America, according to Commerce Department figures. Take only the securities and investment end of the business, and you're still talking about 900,000 people, a population that considerably exceeds Vermont's 626,000. Is Mr. Sanders suggesting that some large proportion of those 900,000 is in on the fraud; that every man among them is a Madoff--including David Wichs? And if they are the criminals he alleges, does he mean to put a few thousand of them behind bars?Those are questions that ought to be put to Mr. Sanders, and ones his supporters might also want to ask themselves. The strength of the Sanders candidacy is said to lie in the purity of his idealism, especially in contrast to the morally flexible and ideologically ambidextrous candidacy of Mrs. Clinton.But the reason Mr. Sanders is drawing his big crowds is neither his fanatical sincerity nor his avuncular charm. It's that he's preaching class hatred to people besotted by the politics of envy. Barack Obama, running for president eight years ago, famously suggested to Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher that ""when you spread the wealth around it's good for everybody.""Mr. Sanders dispenses with the niceties. ""I do not have millionaire or billionaire friends,"" he boasts, as if there's an income ceiling on virtue. That's telling the 10,100,000 American households with a net worth of at least $1 million (excluding the value of their homes) to buzz off.It is also telling any intellectually sentient voter that the drift of the modern Democratic Party runs in the same illiberal direction as the Trumpian right, only with a different set of targets. Mr. Sanders thinks Wall Street's guilt is proved by its capitulation to the demands of a government that could barely prove a single case of banker fraud in court.Another interpretation is that a government with almost unlimited powers to break, sue, micromanage or otherwise ruin an unpopular institution is not a government banks are eager to fight. The problem with capitalism isn't that it concentrates excessive economic power in the hands of the few. It's that it gives political power ever-tastier treats on which to feast. Covering for that weakness is the reason Wall Street plows money into the pockets of pliable Democrats like Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker--and Mrs. Clinton.That's something Mr. Sanders will never understand, being the sort of man whose notion of wisdom is to hold fast to the angry convictions of his adolescence. That may be why he connects with so many younger voters. But it's also why his moral judgments are so sweeping and juvenile. Wall Street remains one of America's crowning glories. To insinuate that the people who make it work are swindlers is no less a slur than to tag immigrants as criminals and moochers.My colleague Holman Jenkins once cracked that some plausible ideas vanish in the presence of thought. I would add that some widespread beliefs vanish in the presence of decency. That goes as much for Bernie Sanders's economic prejudices as it does for Donald Trump's ethnic ones, a thought that ought to trouble the placid consciences of this column's more liberal readers.Write bstephens@wsj.com.Credit: By Bret Stephens",2/9/16
"Clinton, Sanders Jockey in New Hampshire as Primary Looms; Democrats continue to make their pitches to state's voters while positioning themselves for contests ahead",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762746247?accountid=12768,"EXETER, N.H.--Hillary Clinton is still seeking a breakout moment in New Hampshire , where she won a come-from-behind victory eight years ago.Mrs. Clinton has spent the last four days in the state ahead of Tuesday's primary, making appeals to friendly crowds, urging her volunteers to knock on more doors and asking supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders to give her another look.But on the campaign trail Friday, a number of undecided voters said they still weren't sold on the former secretary of state. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showed Mr. Sanders with a 20-point lead in the state.Clinton campaign officials said Mrs. Clinton isn't giving up on New Hampshire. But with an eye on the next two contests, in Nevada and South Carolina, her campaign is taking steps to solidify support among minority voters, who make up large shares of the Democratic voting pool in those states.Mrs. Clinton's campaign released its first Spanish-language TV and radio ads Friday, and a Clinton aide said the candidate would meet later this month with leaders from civil-rights organizations. Mrs. Clinton also plans to travel Sunday to Flint, Mich., to highlight the water crisis in the largely minority city. Polls show her with an expansive lead among minority voters.Mr. Sanders's campaign hopes to leave New Hampshire with a jolt of momentum that could help him build support in Nevada and South Carolina. On Friday, Ben Jealous, the former head of the NAACP, threw his support behind Mr. Sanders, an endorsement that the Vermont senator said would be an ""enormous help.""While the two campaigns jockeyed to position themselves for the weeks ahead, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton continued to make their pitches to New Hampshire voters.Elaine Colligan braved a snowstorm to hear Mrs. Clinton speak in Manchester. The 22-year-old from Exeter is the type of undecided voter that the former secretary of state needs to win over in order to make up ground in New Hampshire, where 76% of voters under 30 support Mr. Sanders, according to the Journal/NBC News/Marist poll.Ms. Colligan said she respects Mrs. Clinton but is leaning toward voting for Mr. Sanders. The former secretary of state's ties to Wall Street, the contributions she has received from fossil-fuel lobbyists, and her changing positions on some issues are troubling, Ms. Colligan said.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 news.* New Hampshire Primary -- Live Coverage* Sanders Aims to Motivate Youth, Win Independents in N.H.

If you've got something to say, say it directly,"" she said.Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said Friday the Vermont senator would continue to discuss Mrs. Clinton's relationship with Wall Street.""I understand why she doesn't want us talking about it,"" Mr. Devine said. ""It's an enormous vulnerability.""He added that the matter is at the heart of Mr. Sanders' message that the political system is stacked in favor of corporate interests.At Mr. Sanders' events Friday, there were signs his criticism of Mrs. Clinton had made inroads with some voters.Debbie Adams, a 56-year-old accountant from Portsmouth, came to hear Mr. Sanders in Manchester, because she was having second thoughts about voting for Mrs. Clinton.""The problem I have with Hillary is she is still 'corporate.' But that's also what I like about her, because she'll be able to get stuff done,"" said Ms. Adams, who still hadn't decided on a candidate after the event.At Mrs. Clinton's ""Women for Hillary"" event, a number of supporters said they were satisfied with the former secretary of state's answers on Wall Street. They said she got the better of Mr. Sanders by challenging him to give specific examples of the industry influencing her policy stances. ""There's nothing wrong with taking money to speak to Wall Street,"" said Anne Ehlert, who came from Arlington, Mass. ""It doesn't change her votes.""Joel Benenson, a Clinton campaign strategist and pollster, said Mrs. Clinton's responses to Wall Street questions were a ""good moment"" for her in the debate. He questioned the importance of Mrs. Clinton releasing the transcripts from her Goldman Sachs speeches--an idea that was raised during the debate.""I don't think voters are interested in the transcripts of her speeches,"" he said. ""I think they're interested in will she take on the powerful forces on Wall Street.""Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Jennifer Levitz",2/9/16
"The Hillary Fantasy; It's duller than Bernie's, but no less unrealistic.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762721394?accountid=12768,"Having been blindsided from the left for the second time in as many presidential campaigns, inevitable Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is trying to mount a defense. Here's the thrust and parry with immoderate moderator Rachel Maddow, from last night's Clinton-Sanders squirmish on MSNBC:Maddow: Secretary Clinton, Sen. Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP [the Trans-Pacific Partnership], if you said single-payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard-bearer.Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Sen. Sanders?Mrs. Clinton: Well because I am a progressive who gets things done.Before elaborating, she went off on three separate tangents. First, she informed viewers that ""the root of that word, progressive, is progress."" (The word duh, by contrast, is sui generis.)Second, she listed a bunch of Democrats, past and future, who supposedly wouldn't be pure enough to meet Sanders's definition of a progressive: President Obama; Vice President Biden; Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the state in whose primary next week Sanders is expected to trounce Mrs. Clinton; and ""even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone.""So according to Mrs. Clinton, even Paul Wellstone wasn't as progressive as Sanders. If that's meant to be an appeal to the left, it seems like one on Sanders's behalf, not Mrs. Clinton's.Third, she went on about gun control, the only issue on which she is undeniably to the left of Sanders, hailing as he does from a constitutional-carry state. ""I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity,"" Mrs. Clinton said. She said something about immigration, then finally circled back to the ""progressive who gets things done"" theme:So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do. That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health-care coverage, get us to universal pre-K, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president.Later she added this:I am not going to make promises I can't keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost. . . .I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda.Inspiring, isn't it?The ""progressive who gets things done"" theme has been fleshed out by many left-liberal commentators. Last month former Enron adviser Paul Krugman plugged Hillary and slugged Bernie in a column titled ""How Change Happens"":[Obama's] achievements have depended at every stage on accepting half loaves as being better than none: health reform that leaves the system largely private, financial reform that seriously restricts Wall Street's abuses without fully breaking its power, higher taxes on the rich but no full-scale assault on inequality. . . .And the question Sanders supporters should ask is, When has their theory of change ever worked? Even F.D.R., who rode the depths of the Great Depression to a huge majority, had to be politically pragmatic, working not just with special interest groups but also with Southern racists. . . .Sorry, but there's nothing noble about seeing your values defeated because you preferred happy dreams to hard thinking about means and ends. Don't let idealism veer into destructive self-indulgence.Ezra Klein , editor of the young-adult site Vox, followed up a week later with ""Hillary Clinton and the Audacity of Political Realism"":The argument for [Mrs.] Clinton is that she's best suited to handle this war of partisan attrition--she knows how to work the bureaucracy, defend against a hostile Congress, and find incremental gains where they exist. This is a realistic vision of a Democratic presidency after Obama. It's a vision, as best I can tell, that's shared by Obama. But it's not a vision liberals want to believe in. It's not a vision that Hillary Clinton has figured out how to sell. Perhaps it's not a vision that can be sold.Blogger Allen Clifton weighed in this week with a post so counterintuitive that Slate should have published it, ""Like It or Not, Hillary Clinton Is Being More Honest With Voters Than Bernie Sanders"":I can promise you this much: when it comes to socializing health care, free public college, more than doubling the minimum wage, raising taxes on the middle class and passing trillions in tax hikes for the wealthy--there's absolutely zero ""common ground"" to be found within the GOP on any of that.The claim, then, is not that Mrs. Clinton has any record of ""getting things done,"" but that she is likelier than Sanders to get things done because she has a more realistic view of what is politically possible.But how realistic are Mrs. Clinton's promises? An old joke has it that if the opposite of ""pro"" is ""con,"" the opposite of progress is Congress. Mrs. Clinton might dispute the etymology, but Krugman, Klein and Clifton all stipulate the near-certainty of a Republican House majority next year (and Krugman believes the Democrats will be ""lucky"" even to take the Senate).If Republicans control just one congressional chamber, Mrs. Clinton's modest ambitions--to ""get us to universal health-care coverage, get us to universal pre-K, paid family leave""--are as fantastical as Sanders's temerarious ones, a point Klein concedes:Democrats were bitterly disappointed by the compromises Obama made when he had huge Democratic majorities. The compromises the next Democratic president will have to make, given the likely Republican dominance of Congress, are going to be even more brutal for liberals--and if they're not, it will likely be because nothing of importance gets done in the first place.The Republicans, by contrast, have a decent shot at taking the presidency and holding the Senate, which would give them the ability to get things done (constrained only by the Senate filibuster). Electing Mrs. Clinton would spare progressives that nightmare. She could also follow Obama's lead and test the limits of executive power to make policy more liberal without changing the law.But all that is as true of Sanders as it is of Mrs. Clinton; and if their campaign rhetoric is a reliable indicator, he would be bolder than she in employing executive action, except in the area of gun control.The only reason for an ideological progressive to prefer Mrs. Clinton over Sanders as the nominee would be risk-aversion--i.e., the assumption that she would have a better chance of winning in November. The combination of her lackluster personality, reputation for corruption, and possible legal jeopardy make that assumption a questionable one.In touting her ability to get things done, Mrs. Clinton may be counting on her married name to provide a halo effect. (Think about that for a moment.) While her own Clinton-era effort at getting something done, the health-care reform of 1993-94, ended in abject failure, it is true that Bill Clinton had numerous legislative victories during his two terms, even during the 1_ terms when Republicans controlled Congress.But much of what Mr. Clinton accomplished was abhorrent from a progressive perspective: welfare reform, tougher criminal laws, a modicum of domestic spending restraint, investment tax cuts, banking deregulation, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mrs. Clinton (in some cases joined by Mr. Clinton) has attempted to distance herself from many of these accomplishments.So what could Mrs. Clinton actually get done if she were president? In an uncharacteristically insightful piece, Vox's Matt Yglesias offers some speculation: ""A Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership,"" ""Corporate tax reform,"" ""Boost in infrastructure spending,"" ""EITC [earned-income tax credit] for childless men,"" ""The Grand Bargain"" (i.e., a budget deal that reduces entitlement spending and raises taxes), and ""Skilled immigration changes.""Progressives would probably support the infrastructure spending and EITC expansion without reservation, if (a big if) they were not accompanied by any provisions to which they'd object, such as reforms of prevailing-wage rules or anti-welfare-fraud measures.""These are the kinds of things that deserve to be highlighted more in the primary campaign,"" Yglesias writes, ""but aren't partially because [Mrs.] Clinton doesn't talk about them--in part because they're kind of boring, but also because they're not necessarily all things liberals will like.""If Sanders becomes president, the ensuing four years are likely to resemble the preceding six. If Mrs. Clinton does, there's a chance they'll end up looking more like the last six years of Mr. Clinton's administration. Given those two unappealing options, why wouldn't progressives vote for the candidate whose sincere commitment to their ideals is beyond dispute?And That's Why She Set Up a Private Server "" 'This is excessive classification.

Sanders Meets Sharpton for Breakfast in Harlem; Civil-rights leader hasn't endorsed in the presidential race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764231397?accountid=12768,"The morning after Bernie Sanders's sweeping victory in the New Hampshire presidential primary , the Vermont senator took his momentum to a Harlem landmark to have tea with the Rev. Al Sharpton.Mr. Sanders arrived at the famed Sylvia's restaurant around 9:50 a.m. Wednesday and waved to a crowd chanting his name. Mr. Sharpton said the meeting lasted 20 minutes and that the senator's visit sent the right message to the black community.Mr. Sharpton said he asked Mr. Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, about the water crisis in Flint, Mich. , affirmative action and police misconduct.""My concern is that in January of next year, for the first time in American history, a black family will be moving out of the White House,"" Mr. Sharpton said. ""I do not want black concerns to be moved out with them.""He said he hadn't decided on an endorsement in the 2016 race, and he will meet with Hillary Clinton next Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton's camp confirmed the meeting.""Sen. Sanders coming here this morning further makes it clear that we will not be ignored,"" Mr. Sharpton said. ""Our votes must be earned.""More in Politics* Chris Christie Is Expected to Suspend Campaign* Bloomberg May See Opening in New Hampshire Primary ResultsHe added Mr. Sanders was also meeting with Kirsten John Foy, Northeast regional director of National Action Network, a civil-rights organization founded by Mr. Sharpton.Also on hand was former head of the NAACP, Ben Jealous, and State Sen. Bill Perkins, a Manhattan Democrat. Both have endorsed Mr. Sanders.""Harlem represents the black community and other communities of color in general but he's going to make sure that he's in all those communities so everybody gets to have the Bern,"" Mr. Perkins said.Also Wednesday, Mr. Sanders appeared on the ABC television show ""The View,"" and a CBS spokeswoman said he would appear Wednesday night on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""Tren'ness Woods-Black, the director of communications for Sylvia's (and granddaughter of Sylvia), said the restaurant remained open to the public during the senator's visit.""We wanted to allow everyone to be able to interact and get a just up-close and personal look at who's actually running,"" said Ms. Woods-Black.Some, however, were disappointed Mr. Sanders didn't do more to interact with the public. After a quick wave to the crowd, the senator departed in his car after the breakfast. Yo Akalu, a 27-year-old City University of New York student, didn't believe the visit was genuine.""If he really wants our votes he really needs to come into these projects, he really needs to go into these schools, he really needs to speak to these families,"" Ms. Akalu said. ""Him coming out here to Harlem, coming straight to Sylvia's...what is that?""But Charles Mannings, a resident of Harlem for 20 years, said he thought the short visit was ""inspiring.""

Bloomberg May See Opening in New Hampshire Primary Results; Victories by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump could boost former NYC mayor's candidacy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764142778?accountid=12768,"Hundreds of miles from the New Hampshire presidential primary, aides to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg eyed the solid victories Tuesday by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump as potential boosts to a Bloomberg candidacy .The results were just one more sign to Mr. Bloomberg's advisers that he may have an opening as Democrats and Republicans embraced candidates they said were unlikely to resonate with voters in a general election. Mr. Bloomberg is expected to meet with Frank Luntz, the pollster and market researcher, this week, according to a person familiar with the matter.Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who served as a senior adviser to Sen. John McCain during his 2008 campaign, said the field of candidates was weak and that the former mayor could win.""Any combination of them in a general election would open a path for an independent candidate,"" said Schmidt, who isn't advising Mr. Bloomberg. ""There's a big opening in the middle of the electorate, and Bloomberg is on point in that space.""Bloomberg aides say they are looking far more closely at the results of Super Tuesday, on March 1, when more states will vote in the primaries and it will be easier to gauge the strength of Mrs. Clinton and others in the race.Related* Michael Bloomberg Mulling Run for President as Independent* Michael Bloomberg Acknowledges He Is Weighing Presidential BidYet, the biggest hurdle to a Bloomberg presidential bid may not hinge on the shifting fortunes of the other candidates, but on the former mayor's political brand. Mr. Bloomberg is a fiscally conservative technocrat with Wall Street roots, a liberal on many social issues and a gun-control advocate. He identified as a Democrat but first ran for mayor in 2001 as a Republican, and later ran as an independent.""He would have zero chance here,"" said Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, a swing state. Mr. Borges said he believed Mr. Bloomberg's positions on issues like gun control would be insurmountable.Other obstacles loom. Some conservative voters, particularly in the South, have ridiculed him for his positions on guns and for a measure in New York City, later turned aside by a court, to restrict the sale of large, sugary drinks.Mr. Bloomberg would also likely face skepticism among Democrats, both for his stout defense of big corporations and for his record on race and policing. A police tactic he embraced known as ""stop-and-frisk"" was criticized as unfairly targeting minorities and struck down in 2013 by a federal judge.Advisers to Mr. Bloomberg said those handicaps could be overcome. One aide broke down Mr. Bloomberg's appeal to voters this way: a political outsider unbeholden to party machinery; private-sector success running Bloomberg LP, his data and media company; three-term mayor of New York, credited with revitalizing the nation's most populous city and driving down crime.""There is a degree of polarization, division and I daresay lack of focus on the major issues facing the country that is exemplified by the entire primary process to date. Including but not limited to New Hampshire,"" said Douglas E. Schoen, a longtime Bloomberg adviser who has conducted polls for the former mayor.Mr. Bloomberg has other advantages. He is worth more than $30 billion and has signaled he is ready to spend. One of his top political aides, Howard Wolfson, served as communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign. He has a stable of loyal aides ready to jump in.The campaign trail could be an awkward place for Mr. Bloomberg, who frequently grew irritated with the New York City press corps for asking personal questions about his life, including his weekend travels to his vacation homes. He isn't a natural campaigner, though his aides noted he grew increasingly easy on the trail as the years passed.""He was used to business groups, marketing professionals--the political media was a very different kind of thing,"" said Bill Cunningham, a former aide to Mr. Bloomberg.A third-party candidate has never succeeded at winning the presidency, though they have shaped the contests, with Ralph Nader in 2000 being the most recent example. Entering the race late, Mr. Bloomberg would face challenges getting on state ballots and building campaign machinery in every state.James McCann, a professor of political science at Purdue University and an expert on third-party candidacies, said Mr. Bloomberg faced an uphill battle. ""It still is difficult to come in from out of the blue and get the traction you need, even when things are really seemingly divisive and there's a great deal of disenchantment, even when you're a billionaire.""Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.comCredit: By Mara Gay and Josh Dawsey",2/10/16
The Left-Right Revolt; Sanders and Trump ride very different populist uprisings in New Hampshire.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763919348?accountid=12768,"Americans keep telling pollsters they're unhappy--or worse--with their political leaders, and on Tuesday they proved it in New Hampshire by handing victories to a 74-year-old socialist and a blustery businessman with no political experience. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are still a long way from the White House, but their victories reveal parallel but very different popular revolts on the left and right.***The uprising on the left is perhaps most surprising given that Democrats hold the White House, and Hillary Clinton campaigned to build on President Obama's record. But in New Hampshire the revolt was ideological and personal against Mrs. Clinton and the status quo.Mr. Obama tilted before the Iowa caucuses toward Mrs. Clinton as his preferred successor, but New Hampshire shows that his Presidency has been a hot-house garden for nurturing progressives. According to the exit polls, nearly seven in 10 Democrats described themselves as liberal, up from 56% in 2008. Roughly a quarter described themselves as ""very liberal,"" and Mr. Sanders won them two to one.Mr. Obama calls inequality the defining issue of our times, and Democrats believe him. A third of Democrats said it is the most important issue facing the country, and about 70% of those voted for Mr. Sanders.Mrs. Clinton won the New Hampshire primary in 2008, but this year Democrats seem to have rejected her on personal and character grounds. Mr. Sanders won nine of 10 voters in the exit polls who said that only Mr. Sanders or neither of the two candidates were ""honest and trustworthy."" The Clinton campaign has tried, as it always does, to plow through her email scandals by portraying them merely as Republican attacks. But even many Democrats don't believe her anymore.Mrs. Clinton now finds herself in a populist showdown she never anticipated and doesn't play to her strengths. She's best as a machine candidate of the unions, feminist volunteers and wealthy environmentalists. Mr. Sanders is motivating the younger liberals who were also drawn to Mr. Obama and who are voting for the Vermonter by three or more to one.The Clinton campaign will console itself that the campaign now moves to states where the electorate will have more minorities and fewer gentry liberals. And to win the nomination Mr. Sanders will have to show that he can expand his support among minorities, especially the black voters who are so important in southern primaries.The Vermont Senator's other great obstacle is that many Democrats still fear that a self-avowed socialist can't win in November. But that argument becomes less damaging as it becomes clearer that Mrs. Clinton has weaknesses that also could be fatal in the fall. As Republicans get closer to nominating the mercurial Mr. Trump, more Democrats may also conclude that even Mr. Sanders could win so why not take a chance on their true heart?Which brings us to Mr. Trump and the revolt on the right. This is less about ideology and policies than the businessman's political style and Republican disgust with Washington. The New Yorker dominated the field with some 34% of the vote as we went to press, while no other candidate broke into the high teens. The victory showed that, contrary to Iowa, Mr. Trump could translate polling leads into actual votes. And it showed that the ceiling in his support is higher than many Republicans have believed.The businessman did especially well among voters without a college degree, but his support was strong across most demographic and ideological groups. He's the choice of voters who like that he ""tells it like it is"" and think he can change Washington. But the exit polls also showed some signs of potential weakness. A little less than a third of his voters said they liked Mr. Trump but had reservations. And his share of voters who said he could best handle an international crisis was below his overall vote share.As for the others, Mr. Trump will be happy that no clear alternative emerged. John Kasich's investment in the Granite State--100 town halls--paid off with a second-place finish. The Ohio Governor did well among independents and especially moderates. His challenge going forward will be that there are fewer of both of those voting blocs as the primaries head to South Carolina next week and elsewhere in the South on March 1. He will have to raise money fast to be competitive, as well as show he can win over more conservative voters.Jeb Bush spent heavily in the state and has to be disappointed to finish in the mix for third or fourth place as we went to press. He has been performing better in debates and has the money to fight on in South Carolina, but he will have to show he can beat Mr. Kasich and Marco Rubio to go much beyond that.Mr. Rubio may be the most disappointed by Tuesday's result because the Florida Senator couldn't build on his Iowa surge and suffered from his debate brain-freeze on Saturday. More late deciders turned to other candidates, and some two-thirds said that debates influenced their votes.Ted Cruz also failed to capitalize on his Iowa victory, notably in failing to make inroads among voters who aren't evangelicals or very conservative. The Texas Senator will find more fertile territory in the South, but his showing in New England bodes ill for winning swing states if he is the GOP nominee in November.***All of which means that New Hampshire hasn't performed its traditional role of winnowing the field as much as usual. Chris Christie will find it hard to continue after his sixth-place finish, as will also-rans Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. The rest have a case to fight on. But one big lesson of New Hampshire is that if the non-winners want to become the GOP nominee, they will sooner rather than later have to stop attacking each other and start educating voters about Donald J. Trump.",2/10/16
"Results in New Hampshire Point to Hillary Clinton's Weaknesses; Sanders's message is exciting his core supporters more than Clinton is energizing her base, exit polls show",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763919247?accountid=12768,"Democrats in the first two presidential nominating contests have delivered a clear message to Hillary Clinton about her weaknesses as a candidate. She isn't considered trustworthy, and her message of competence and experience isn't sufficiently compelling.About a quarter of Iowa's Democratic caucusgoers last week said the quality they most wanted in a nominee was honesty and trustworthiness. Among that group, voter surveys showed, Mrs. Clinton won a mere 10%.The verdict was more severe in New Hampshire on Tuesday. One-third of voters said they most wanted honesty in a nominee, and Mrs. Clinton carried 5% of those voters.The results in part reflect the months of controversy Mrs. Clinton generated by using a private email system during her time as secretary of state, questions about her family's charitable foundation, as well as speaking fees she earned from Wall Street firms that are a favorite target of liberal Democrats.Mrs. Clinton left the Obama administration in early 2013 with a positive image, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling shows. But by last month, some 40% of registered voters viewed her unfavorably while a larger share--49%--saw her in a negative light.The results from Iowa and New Hampshire also signaled that Mrs. Clinton has yet to fashion an argument for her candidacy as powerful as the liberal vision laid out by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders promises to end a ""corrupt'' campaign-finance system that he says allows the wealthy and Wall Street buy influence and rig the economy in their favor.Mrs. Clinton also has laid out liberal goals, but her candidacy also rests on her long experience in public life and the argument that she would make the stronger general election candidate. In New Hampshire, however, Democratic primary voters said they most wanted a nominee who was ""honest'' and ""cares about people like me.''Some 60% of voters chose one of those two qualities, exit polls showed, and Mr. Sanders carried both groups by lopsided margins.By contrast, 38% said experience or the ability to win in November was the most important quality in a nominee. Mrs. Clinton won those groups by large margins, exit polls showed.Mr. Sanders's message is exciting his core supporters more than Mrs. Clinton is energizing her base. She carried her strongest voting group, women age 45 and older, by seven percentage points in New Hampshire, 53% to 46%, exit polls showed.Mr. Sanders, by contrast, posted prohibitively large margins among the groups that most responded to his message. Some three-quarters of Democratic primary voters under age 45 backed him in New Hampshire, including 83% of voters under 30.Young women, who many presumed would be part of the Clinton coalition, are instead turning to Mr. Sanders. He carried women under age 45 by 40 percentage points in New Hampshire, 69% to 29%.While Iowa and New Hampshire proved to be unexpectedly difficult tests for Mrs. Clinton, the race now moves to states that could prove to be friendlier terrain. The first contests took place in two of the most liberal and least racially diverse states in the nation. Next come states with larger shares of minority and centrist voters, who in opinion surveys have favored Mrs. Clinton.Credit: By Aaron Zitner",2/10/16
Nevada Caucus Offers New Test for Democrats; Hillary Clinton hopes state's minority voters will help her rebound against Bernie Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763896378?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS--Next up for the Democratic presidential candidates is Nevada, the state that offers the first real test of whether minority voters will help Hillary Clinton stall Sen. Bernie Sanders's momentum or rally behind her rival's insurgent campaign.Hispanics and African-Americans may account for one-third of those who show up for the Western state's caucuses on Feb. 20. A Sanders victory here would expose the first cracks in the ""firewall"" the Clinton campaign says it has built in states that are more racially and ethnically diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. Should the former senator and secretary of state rebound from her loss in New Hampshire , it would buttress her claim to being the sole Democrat with broad national support.Clinton allies seem relieved to be fighting on new terrain. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., Ill.) stopped at a Clinton campaign office in east Las Vegas on Monday, looked out at the many Hispanic and black volunteers and said: ""This is what America looks like! I like Iowa. I like New Hampshire. But this is what America looks like!""Nevada's electorate is not only less white but more centrist. In 2008, liberals accounted for 56% of New Hampshire primary voters--12 points higher than in Nevada. Whites made up 94% of New Hampshire primary voters Tuesday, according to early exit polls, compared with just 65% of caucus-goers in Nevada in 2008, which was based on entrance polls.Neither campaign is certain how many people will show up for the caucuses. In 2008, about 120,000 Nevadans took part, which was about 22% of registered Democrats. The state will send 43 delegates and three alternates to the Democratic nominating convention in Philadelphia in July.The Democratic contest in Nevada will be held the same day as the Republicans' South Carolina primary. The GOP's Nevada caucuses are a few days later, and the Democrats then hold their own South Carolina primary on Feb. 27.Mindful of the stakes in Nevada, the two rivals are competing hard. The Clinton team arrived in Nevada in April, the same month she entered the race. Aides plunged into the painstaking work of culling voter lists. They set up Spanish-language training sessions and mock caucuses so that Mrs. Clinton's Hispanic supporters would know what to expect at caucus sites. In her 2008 presidential bid, Mrs. Clinton won 64% of Hispanic voters in Nevada, compared with 26% for then-Sen. Barack Obama, exit polls showed.Mr. Sanders's team didn't arrive until October, having given priority to operations in New Hampshire and Iowa and wanting to make sure the campaign had enough money.Since then, a Sanders campaign flush with cash opened a dozen offices and hired more than 90 campaign workers. His campaign has been airing television ads steadily in Nevada since December, making use of Spanish-language TV and radio. The Clinton campaign, for its part, won't say how many paid staff it has in the state. It has fewer offices but also makes use of volunteers' homes, aides said.""We had to be prudent with funding state operations, and once it became clear that the campaign would be well-funded, then we were able to expand into other states,"" said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager. ""Do we have some ground to make up? Absolutely.""Eight years ago, Nevada Democrats produced a split decision: Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote but Mr. Obama walked away with more delegates. This time, her campaign hopes to win not just the large cities but also remote precincts that offer a disproportionate share of delegates under the state's caucus rules.""It's really difficult to run up the score in one place,"" said the Clinton campaign's Nevada director, Emmy Ruiz. ""We need to have a strong showing in these [Las Vegas caucus sites], but also need to have a strong showing in Sumerlin and Pahrump and Elko.""That explains what Bill Clinton was doing Saturday in tiny Pahrump, speaking at an elementary school. The town is part of Nye County, which has fewer than 8,000 registered Democrats but boasts a small cache of delegates the Clinton campaign doesn't want to pass up.Mrs. Clinton has won the support of prominent Nevada party officials and Hispanic activists. Her state campaign team includes people with deep roots in Nevada politics.Rory Reid, a Clinton supporter and son of Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, said: ""She's even better organized than she was in 2008 and therefore should be just as successful.""Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, is the darling of young voters, and he could benefit by rules that allow residents to register on the day of the caucuses. The Sanders campaign is wooing teenagers and 20-somethings with events like ""Bands for Bernie"" concerts throughout the state.It seems to be working. Yvanna Cancela, political director of the powerful culinary workers union, said she was at a bar in Las Vegas recently and noticed that a young man sitting next to her was doodling on his cocktail napkin. ""Bernie Sanders is the future,"" he had written.Even some older folks are feeling the Bern.Zaffar Iqbal, 44, is a physician who for the first time in his life is getting active in presidential politics, canvassing neighborhoods in support of Mr. Sanders.Too many of his patients can't afford the drugs he prescribes, and he believes Mr. Sanders's proposed government-run health-care plan would ease the cost. ""Bernie has inspired me,"" Dr. Iqbal said in a campaign office in Las Vegas.What looks to be close a race has sparked tensions between the two camps. The culinary union, which hasn't made an endorsement, was upset to hear that Sanders supporters posed as union members to talk to hotel employees. Mr. Weaver, in an interview, said: ""We certainly have nothing but the deepest respect for culinary workers and we certain have made sure that no one does that again.""Paul Overberg contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",2/10/16
"Sanders and Trump Win Big But Leave Their Races Unsettled; This year, results from Iowa and New Hampshire don't do much to winnow the field for either party",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763892697?accountid=12768,"For years, plenty of players in the American political system have quietly wished that the outsize role of two small and quirky states--Iowa and New Hampshire--in picking presidential nominees could be reduced.Maybe this is the year that has come true.With the results now in from New Hampshire's primary, what's striking is how little those two states, the ones that often launch new front-runners and bring leaders crashing down to earth, have actually settled.Donald Trump won New Hampshire's Republican primary in convincing fashion, and he leaves the state as the clear leader and with momentum. Still, there's no single alternative to him, but rather a muddle of four candidates just below who will battle on; the field is far from winnowed. And now the campaign moves on to states where the movement conservatives and evangelicals who denied Mr. Trump victory in Iowa again hold much greater power. The picture is unsettled.On the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won an impressive victory, one that will rattle plenty of party leaders who wanted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to cruise to the nomination unruffled and well financed. But the race moves on to two states, Nevada and South Carolina, where his core supporters--white, well-educated liberals and young voters--fade in importance and give way to a large contingent of the Hispanic and African-American voters that figure to be her strength and his Achilles' heel.So voters in states across America now have every reason to think they, too, will get a voice in deciding these nominations. Five, perhaps six Republican candidates will battle on. The names Kasich, Cruz, Rubio, Bush and Trump--and perhaps Christie as well--are linked for at least several more weeks.Among Democrats, Mr. Sanders has humbled the once inevitable candidate and emerged with two attributes so many other upstart challengers haven't had: a natural base of support and a big bank account.So these races aren't ending soon.Of course, history can't be entirely ignored, especially when it comes to Iowa and New Hampshire. No candidate has lost both states and gone on to win a party's nomination since Bill Clinton in 1992. That means Sen. Ted Cruz, who won Iowa, and Mr. Trump, after winning New Hampshire, have an advantage, and Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton are both in the game, if history is any guide.But this is an election cycle that already has shown little to no respect for traditions and precedents, and there's no reason to think traditional order will be restored now. It's better at this point to look at what New Hampshire told us about relative strengths and vulnerabilities in each field.Those who continue to doubt Mr. Trump's strength will need to look long and hard at how even his support was across all kinds of demographic lines in New Hampshire.Exit polls showed he did well with moderates and conservatives, and, for someone whose ideology is mistrusted by many on the Republican right, he did surprisingly well among very conservative voters. He did well among all age groups except, perhaps, the most elderly.He continues to do best among GOP voters with less than a college education, and soars among those who say immigration is their top issue, but what is most striking is the way his support spreads out across the GOP electorate. And he will benefit as long as the non-Trump is divided among multiple challengers.Yet here is the problem for Mr. Trump, and the opening for those four candidates clustered just behind him: Once again in New Hampshire, he didn't do as well among late-deciders than among those who made their minds up long ago.Many late-deciders indicated they broke for Mr. Kasich; the largest bloc of Trump supporters were those who said they made their minds up more than a month ago. So in New Hampshire, as in Iowa, there were signs that the core of Trump voters are very loyal, but also hints that he may not have succeeded in expanding that core as the campaign wore on.A similar dynamic emerges among the Democrats as the New Hampshire dust settles. Exit polls showed little movement among Democratic voters despite the furious campaigning and a dramatic debate between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton. There was little difference between those who decided early and those who decided late. Mr. Sanders's support, like Mr. Trump's, was solid all along.But the troubling finding for Mr. Sanders--and the encouraging one for Mrs. Clinton--is how much of his support came from New Hampshire voters who called themselves independent. She broke even among mainstream Democrats, and her candidacy hinges on the party's mainstream now stepping up for her.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",2/10/16
"Bernie Sanders Wins New Hampshire Democratic Primary, Defeating Hillary Clinton; New Hampshire primary results: Sanders victory boosts his momentum heading into states where he's expected to have weaker showings",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763852263?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H.--Bernie Sanders soundly defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, propelled by independents and young voters wary about the economy and skeptical that the next generation of Americans will live a better life.Once considered a fringe candidate who stood little chance against Mrs. Clinton, the Vermont senator pulled off a sweeping victory. With more than half of New Hampshire's precincts reporting, Mr. Sanders had 59% of the vote compared with 39% for Mrs. Clinton. The Associated Press called the race for Mr. Sanders at 8 p.m. ET.Mr. Sanders defeated Mrs. Clinton among women and swept all age categories except voters over 65, surveys of voters as they exited polling precincts showed. The result underscored the appeal of Mr. Sanders's argument that billionaire families and powerful companies are rigging the economy against the American middle class.At the same time, Mrs. Clinton's defeat suggested that her central message isn't resonating and that she can't count on voters to choose her because of her years of experience as a first lady, senator and secretary of state. Only 27% of Democratic voters said it was important that candidates have the ""right experience,"" exit surveys showed.Mr. Sanders, in his victory speech, told supporters they had sent a message that would echo from Wall Street to Washington. ""The government of our great country belongs to all of the people, and not just wealthy campaign contributors and their super PACs,"" he said.Mr. Sanders, whose win Tuesday was powered by high turnout, predicted that result would be repeated across the nation.Mrs. Clinton, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2008, declared that, ""I still love New Hampshire and I always will."" And seeking to use the defeat to show she is a fighter, she promised to take the battle to other states and said, ""It is not whether you get knocked down that matters, it is whether you get back up.""Even before the primary, Mrs. Clinton began retooling her message and said she would reexamine her campaign strategy in hopes of blunting Mr. Sanders's momentum.Mr. Sanders made deep inroads with voters outside the mainstream of Democratic politics. About 40% of those taking part in the Democratic primary were independents, and Mr. Sanders prevailed among those by a commanding 72% to 27%, the exit polls showed. The two candidates split self-identified Democrats evenly, according to the polls.Voters were clearly receptive to Mr. Sanders's populist message. Only 27% described themselves as politically moderate, while 69% called themselves liberal--a dynamic that could change as the race moves to states with more centrist Democratic voters.Asked if the economic system in America favors the wealthy, 90% of Democratic voters said yes, the exit polls showed. And by a margin of nearly 4 to 1, voters said they trusted Mr. Sanders more than Mrs. Clinton to deal with income inequality.Lisa Colavito, a nurse from Concord, said she voted for Mr. Sanders ""because we need to get the money out of politics."" She added, ""He's a grassroots candidate, he stands by his word, and he's been consistent.""Ms. Colavito said she wasn't persuaded by the prospect that Mrs. Clinton could be the first female president. ""I just want a person that's good for the job,"" she said.Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had expected her to be in a stronger position at this point in the race, people familiar with their thinking said.One person familiar with internal discussions said that inside the Clinton campaign, there is debate over two points. The first is how hard Mrs. Clinton herself should attack Mr. Sanders. Among those advocating a sharper tone is her husband, who himself went after Mr. Sanders in sharp terms last weekend.The second question is whether she should reshape the way she describes her vision, away from the policy-heavy speeches she is most comfortable with, where she projects herself as an effective pragmatist, and toward a more lofty, visionary message.Mrs. Clinton's aides, at her election-night gathering, said that in coming weeks she would emphasize social-justice issues, going beyond what they see as Mr. Sanders's narrower focus on economic justice.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 news.* New Hampshire Primary -- Live Coverage* New Hampshire Exit Polls Show Anxious Voters Eager for Change* Sanders Out-Raises Clinton in Silicon Valley* Donald Trump Triumphs in New Hampshire Republican Primary* Focus in the Republican Race Will Soon Shift to South Carolina* Hillary Clinton Finds Young Female Voters' Support Elusive* New Hampshire Primary Results Live* New Hampshire Exit Polls by the Numbers* Photos From the Race in New HampshireNext up for the Democrats are caucuses in Nevada, a state with more minority voters than Iowa or New Hampshire. That would give Mrs. Clinton, who has wide support in minority communities, a chance to rebound and demonstrate that she has more broad-based national support than the senator from Vermont.First, though, she needs to come up with a more compelling rationale for her candidacy, many Clinton allies say. While Mrs. Clinton has put forward a mix of policy proposals, her supporters say she has yet to lay out a succinct explanation of why she wants to be president.By contrast, Mr. Sanders has steadily gained ground with a message that is apparently resonating with young voters in particular: Billionaires and powerful corporations are corrupting the political system and making it harder for middle-class Americans to get ahead.Now, campaign aides say, Mrs. Clinton is beginning to give voice to a message that is more positive, personal and even spiritual, talking about concepts like gratitude and the need to move forward in life.""The problem is that she needs an overarching message other than 'I'm almost as far left as Bernie but not quite,' "" said Douglas Schoen, a former adviser to Mr. Clinton. ""She has to answer the basic question of why she wants to be president. So far she hasn't done that.""In the run-up to Tuesday's New Hampshire balloting, both Mrs. Clinton and her husband have suggested they are open to a course correction.The ex-president is frustrated by his wife's slow start and unhappy she isn't polling better with female voters, people familiar with his thinking said. In an interview with MSNBC on the eve of the primary, Mrs. Clinton said: ""Of course it would be malpractice not to say, 'OK, what worked? What can we do better? What do we have to do new and different that we have to pull out?' ""But Mrs. Clinton's experience makes it challenging for her to present a sweeping vision for change, something for which voters have shown an appetite.Mrs. Clinton found herself in a similar position in her first presidential bid in 2008. She finished a disappointing third in Iowa, came back to win New Hampshire and was in a far tougher contest with then-Sen. Barack Obama than she initially envisioned.Many veterans of that race said that even though she ultimately lost, she made adjustments and improved as a candidate during the course of the campaign, making herself more accessible to voters. She drank a shot of whiskey with voters in Indiana and tried her hand at bowling in a TV appearance. Known as a controlled candidate, she teared up in New Hampshire when describing the stresses of the campaign trail.Anita Dunn, who worked on Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign, recalls Mrs. Clinton's improvement after losing a string of contests in March.

""Voters responded to her because she was continuing to fight.""People love comeback stories, and people want to see if you've been a front-runner and you get knocked down, how you respond,"" she said. ""How she responded was to become a much better candidate. I think that said something about her character.""Mrs. Clinton had what her aides saw as a revealing and helpful moment at a CNN forum last week, where she was asked by a rabbi how she balances the need to make a difference in the world and the need for humility.She replied with a nuanced, spiritual and personal explanation of the need to practice what she called ""the discipline of gratitude.""""So regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful,"" she said. ""Be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe. Be grateful for your limitations. Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you. Listen to your critics, answer the questions.""Her aides are keen to find ways to incorporate those types of thoughts into her speeches, and over the course of the past several days, in fits and starts, a new message emerged.""You have taught me again and again the only direction that matters in life is forward,"" she told Democrats at a party dinner Friday night. ""We've got to stop bad things from happening, but I believe we've got to start good things happening again in America.""Over the weekend, while she occasionally would revert to her standard, policy-heavy pitch, she repeatedly asked audiences to imagine a better world, pointing to all the things she hoped to improve.Still, with Mrs. Clinton having been on the national stage for a quarter century, it isn't clear that voters who have been cool to her will give her a second look.Mike Perry, a resident of Laconia, N.H., said Tuesday he planned to cast his vote for Mr. Sanders. ""I like what he's offering,"" he said. ""He wants to make changes, and that's what I want to hear.""Mr. Perry said he didn't want to elaborate about his feelings about Mrs. Clinton, but that he strongly believed she wasn't the right candidate for the job. ""I don't like her,"" he said. ""I just don't.""Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",2/10/16

Mrs. Clinton won last week's Iowa caucuses by the slimmest of margins, and polls showed she was trailing Mr. Sanders as votes were cast in New Hampshire.Surveys of New Hampshire voters as they left their polling places Tuesday showed many were pessimistic about the future. They saw the economy as skewed in favor of the wealthy and didn't believe the next generation of Americans would be better off. All these are sentiments that appeared to play into Mr. Sanders's call for a political revolution.The state's large population of independent voters was poised to be a particularly big factor in the race, accounting for about 4 in 10 Democratic primary voters, preliminary exit poll results showed. That would also seem to favor Mr. Sanders, who has been beating Mrs. Clinton among independents, while she has topped her rival among Democratic Party members.One person familiar with internal discussions said that inside the Clinton campaign, there is debate over two points.

"Hillary Clinton Cast in Underdog Role as New Hampshire Votes; With Bernie Sanders expected to win, the margin of victory will be closely watched",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763783704?accountid=12768,"CONCORD, N.H.--Eight years after her surprise victory here, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton enters Tuesday's New Hampshire primary as the underdog, as voters head to the polls in the second Democratic presidential nominating contest.Polls show that Mrs. Clinton is facing a stiff challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist from the neighboring state of Vermont. With Mrs. Clinton eking out only the narrowest of wins in last week's Iowa caucuses , both sides are bracing for the possibility of a long, drawn-out primary slog.A CNN/WMUR poll on the eve of the primary shows Mr. Sanders with a huge 26-point lead over Mrs. Clinton. A UMass Lowell/7News poll gives him a 16-point lead in the Granite State, while a polling average of recent surveys by the website Real Clear Politics gives him a narrower 13.3-point lead.With Mr. Sanders expected to win, the margin of victory will be closely watched. If Mrs. Clinton keeps it close, her campaign will chalk it up as a victory of sorts. But a blowout for Mr. Sanders will boost his momentum heading into states where he was expected to have weaker showings.Mrs. Clinton still holds some major advantages in the race, including a substantial lead among nonwhite voters and the institutional support of most of the Democratic Party. Mr. Sanders, by contrast, has shown a capacity for grass roots fundraising and an ability to turnout younger voters and liberals.Despite her expected loss, Mrs. Clinton cheerfully greeted voters at polling places and thanked her campaign staff. She also did some local radio interviews and picked up doughnuts at a local Dunkin' Donuts to give to her volunteers.""You know, I just love the way New Hampshire does this. I like the way the people of New Hampshire take it so seriously. They focus in on the issues and they keep coming back,"" she said at Parker-Varney School in Manchester. ""I'm just looking for a great Election Day. As many people who can turn out, express their opinions and, you know, be part of the process.""After Mrs. Clinton's razor-thin victory in Iowa last week, both sides are well funded and bracing for a protracted primary campaign that few would have predicted just six months ago. Following New Hampshire, the race moves to friendlier terrain for Mrs. Clinton in the South. But before that, she began testing new messages and laying groundwork for the coming contests.Noting the palpable frustration in the electorate, she told voters at one of her campaign stops, ""Anger is not a plan, and venting is not a strategy.""Related Coverage* Sanders Leads in New Hampshire's Early Voting Towns, Republicans in Dead Heat* N.H.

And Mrs. Clinton etched out a hopeful entreaty, asking supporters to envision a better America and asserting that her pragmatic approach would deliver the change they are seeking.""For me this election is a turning-point election in so many ways,"" she said. ""I want you to imagine with me what it is we are trying to accomplish together.""Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, stuck to the message that has taken him this far: a full-throated denunciation of big money in politics, Wall Street and income inequality. ""Is that what America is supposed to be about?"" he asked at one of four New Hampshire events Monday.""No!"" shouted someone from the theater seats.""I don't think so,"" Mr. Sanders agreed.He asked people in the audience to share their student-debt load and their health-care deductibles to provide evidence that his plans for free college tuition and government-funded health care are both urgently needed. He also mocked people who call his ideas ""radical.""Both campaigns have worked to manage expectations in recent days. The Sanders team predicted a close race, and the Clinton campaign argued that Mr. Sanders held an almost-insurmountable advantage because he hails from a neighboring state.New Hampshire has been welcoming territory for the Clintons in the past. Bill Clinton declared himself the ""comeback kid"" after finishing second in the 1992 primary. And Mrs. Clinton's come-from-behind-win in 2008 revived her campaign after a third-place finish in Iowa.On Monday, Mrs. Clinton denied reports that she was considering a staff shake-up in the wake of what are likely to be disappointing results in the first two contests.""We're going to take stock, but it's going to be the campaign that I've got,"" she said in an interview with MSNBC.The question is whether Mr. Sanders could parlay a primary win here into momentum elsewhere, as the campaign moves to Nevada and South Carolina, where minority voters make up a much larger share of the electorate. Polling shows Mrs. Clinton well ahead with both African-Americans and Latinos.""The more people get to know Bernie, the better they like him,"" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said Monday. ""Coming off a virtual tie in Iowa and--knock on wood--a win here, will give us a strong shot. I'm not sure it changes the odds altogether, but it's going to make things different.""Mrs. Clinton has begun to position herself for future contests with a quick trip Sunday to Flint, Mich. , to address the water crisis in the majority-African-American city. Her message at times, though, was overshadowed in recent days by controversial statements from some of her strongest supporters.Gloria Steinem, the feminist writer and organizer, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright both drew criticism for separate comments that appeared to rebuke young women for supporting Mr. Sanders. At a Clinton event, Ms. Albright said, ""there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other,"" a line she has used for some time. In an interview with comedian Bill Maher, Ms. Steinem suggested that younger women were gravitating toward Mr. Sanders in an effort to meet men.On Sunday, Mr. Clinton grabbed a share of the spotlight when he delivered an extended and aggressive attack on the Vermont senator. The former president cast Mr. Sanders as a hypocrite and a dishonest politician and criticized the senator's supporters for launching profane and sexist attacks on Mrs. Clinton and her backers.By Monday, the former president's public remarks had been toned down, with only a brief critique of Mr. Sanders's assertion that the former secretary of state is part of ""the establishment.""""I have to be careful of what I say,"" Mr. Clinton said in Manchester.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com , Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler, Byron Tau and Colleen McCain Nelson",2/10/16
The Myths of Black Lives Matter; The movement has won over Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But what if its claims are fiction?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764468074?accountid=12768,"A television ad for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign now airing in South Carolina shows the candidate declaring that ""too many encounters with law enforcement end tragically."" She later adds: ""We have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism.""Her Democratic presidential rival, Bernie Sanders, met with the Rev. Al Sharpton on Wednesday. Mr. Sanders then tweeted that ""As President, let me be very clear that no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will."" And he appeared on the TV talk show ""The View"" saying, ""It is not acceptable to see unarmed people being shot by police officers.""Apparently the Black Lives Matter movement has convinced Democrats and progressives that there is an epidemic of racist white police officers killing young black men. Such rhetoric is going to heat up as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders court minority voters before the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary.But what if the Black Lives Matter movement is based on fiction? Not just the fictional account of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., but the utter misrepresentation of police shootings generally.To judge from Black Lives Matter protesters and their media and political allies, you would think that killer cops pose the biggest threat to young black men today. But this perception, like almost everything else that many people think they know about fatal police shootings, is wrong.The Washington Post has been gathering data on fatal police shootings over the past year and a half to correct acknowledged deficiencies in federal tallies. The emerging data should open many eyes.For starters, fatal police shootings make up a much larger proportion of white and Hispanic homicide deaths than black homicide deaths. According to the Post database, in 2015 officers killed 662 whites and Hispanics, and 258 blacks. (The overwhelming majority of all those police-shooting victims were attacking the officer, often with a gun.) Using the 2014 homicide numbers as an approximation of 2015's, those 662 white and Hispanic victims of police shootings would make up 12% of all white and Hispanic homicide deaths. That is three times the proportion of black deaths that result from police shootings.The lower proportion of black deaths due to police shootings can be attributed to the lamentable black-on-black homicide rate. There were 6,095 black homicide deaths in 2014--the most recent year for which such data are available--compared with 5,397 homicide deaths for whites and Hispanics combined. Almost all of those black homicide victims had black killers.Police officers--of all races--are also disproportionately endangered by black assailants. Over the past decade, according to FBI data, 40% of cop killers have been black. Officers are killed by blacks at a rate 2.5 times higher than the rate at which blacks are killed by police.Some may find evidence of police bias in the fact that blacks make up 26% of the police-shooting victims, compared with their 13% representation in the national population. But as residents of poor black neighborhoods know too well, violent crimes are disproportionately committed by blacks. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, though they made up roughly 15% of the population there.Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities, raising officers' own risk of using lethal force.The Black Lives Matter movement claims that white officers are especially prone to shooting innocent blacks due to racial bias, but this too is a myth. A March 2015 Justice Department report on the Philadelphia Police Department found that black and Hispanic officers were much more likely than white officers to shoot blacks based on ""threat misperception""--that is, the mistaken belief that a civilian is armed.A 2015 study by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Greg Ridgeway, formerly acting director of the National Institute of Justice, found that, at a crime scene where gunfire is involved, black officers in the New York City Police Department were 3.3 times more likely to discharge their weapons than other officers at the scene.The Black Lives Matter movement has been stunningly successful in changing the subject from the realities of violent crime. The world knows the name of Michael Brown but not Tyshawn Lee, a 9-year-old black child lured into an alley and killed by gang members in Chicago last fall. Tyshawn was one of dozens of black children gunned down in America last year. The Baltimore Sun reported on Jan. 1: ""Blood was shed in Baltimore at an unprecedented pace in 2015, with mostly young, black men shot to death in a near-daily crush of violence.""Those were black lives that mattered, and it is a scandal that outrage is heaped less on the dysfunctional culture that produces so many victims than on the police officers who try to protect them.Ms. Mac Donald is the Thomas W.

How Sanders Exposed Clinton; Hillary was 'tough' and 'masterful'--until Bernie whispered what was obvious.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764468062?accountid=12768,"Democrats awoke Wednesday with a thought usually reserved for Republicans: Hillary Clinton is a disaster. The marvel is that she fooled them for so long.Picture Bernie Sanders as a small child in the court of Empress Clinton, and you have a modern twist on Hans Christian Andersen. The adoring Democratic townspeople oohed and aahed over their ""tough"" and ""experienced"" and ""masterful"" leader, the anointed heir to the Clinton throne. Then Bernie murmured what was obvious, and the crowd looked again.What they saw in New Hampshire was a dour, 68-year-old woman, shouting at her audience in her best impression of emotion. They saw a gaunt former president, rambling to half-empty forums, grumping about his wife's political opponent. They saw the candidate's surrogates try to snag the votes of young women by threatening them with eternal damnation. They saw a campaign in disarray, dragging carload upon carload of ethical baggage. They saw that the empress has no (or very few) clothes.No one knows whether Bernie Sanders can pull off a nomination. But what everyone does know now is that Hillary has (and is) a problem either way. Let's dispense with some spin: Bernie never had a lock on the Granite State. New Hampshire had stepped up for the Clintons twice before, in 1992 and 2008. This year Hillary went into the contest with endorsements, a huge operation and plenty of money.What she didn't have was the interest of voters. They'd had their eyes opened, and they chose to use their primary to highlight Mrs. Clinton's many and obvious political weaknesses. She may still be the favorite to hold her party's banner, but the mantle of inevitability has been stripped away.New Hampshire exposed again what a wooden candidate Hillary is. Mr. Sanders strolls on stage and makes his audience sing and cheer. Mrs. Clinton's events begin with propaganda videos about her past, followed by a tutorial on why she deserves this. They are heavy, and droning.She cannot do uplifting. She had the same likability problem in her 2000 race for the Senate, when she had to spend a fortune to beat an unknown Republican in liberal New York. The same problem popped up in 2008, against Barack Obama. Why anyone thought she would improve on a third go is a mystery.New Hampshire also uncovered the mismanagement that always attends the Clintons. Hillary wakes up every day with a new campaign. She ignores Mr. Sanders. Then she runs left. Then she attacks him. Then she softens. Her staff has endless debates, which always end up leaked to the press, about whether she needs to appear ""stronger,"" or more ""human,"" or ""sharper,"" or ""softer,"" or more ""pragmatic,"" or more ""lofty.""She has a habit of unceremoniously firing campaign teams. And this scattershot approach comes from a woman who has been plotting to be president for at least a decade? All this shifting may be another reason why the public sees her as ""untrustworthy.""To that point, New Hampshire proved that concerns about Mrs. Clinton's ethics aren't merely a right-wing talking point. They've permeated the electorate. Some stunning numbers: Among the one-third of Democratic primary voters who said ""honesty"" was the top quality they wanted in a nominee, Mr. Sanders won 91% . Among the quarter who said they focused on a candidate who ""cares about people like me,"" Mr. Sanders won 82%.Finally, New Hampshire exposed how out of touch the Clinton machine is with the modern liberal movement. Mrs. Clinton based her campaign on the tropes of a fading Democratic establishment. She figured that women would vote for her simply because she had the right anatomy. She figured that college grads and wealthier Democrats would vote for her because she had more pragmatic policies. She figured that the bulk of voters still viewed the Clinton operation as a sure ticket to the White House.In fairness, she won her age group--those 65 or older, who grew up with the Clintons. But she lost everyone else: women, men, college grads, blue-collar workers. She lost every income level except those making more than $200,000. She lost liberals. And moderates.What makes Mrs. Clinton's miscalculation notable is that the party's shift was on full, neon view before she even entered the race. It was walking around in the form of Elizabeth Warren. The worry for Mrs. Clinton is that she might be unable to heal the rifts. Barack Obama's soaring rhetoric was able to reunite his party in 2008. Hillary doesn't have his skills.Responsibility for her crushing New Hampshire defeat can't be placed on Mrs. Clinton alone. Her party leadership is in it with her. Since 2008 the Clinton juggernaut has projected Hillary as the party's only option, and Democrats bought it. They closed their eyes to her flaws and scandals, ignored the shifting progressive winds, pushed potential rivals aside, and raved about the empress's lovely clothes. Then Bernie started whispering.Write to kim@wsj.com.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",2/11/16

Bloomberg May See Opening in New Hampshire Primary Results; Victories by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump could boost former NYC mayor's candidacy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764229421?accountid=12768,"Far from the New Hampshire primary, aides to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg eyed the solid victories Tuesday by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump as potential boosts to a Bloomberg candidacy .The results, Bloomberg advisers said, were a fresh sign he may have an opening, as Democrats and Republicans embraced candidates the aides said were unlikely to resonate with voters in a general election.Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who served as a senior adviser to Sen. John McCain during his 2008 campaign, said the field of candidates was weak and that the former mayor could win.""Any combination of them in a general election would open a path for an independent candidate,"" said Mr. Schmidt, who isn't advising Mr. Bloomberg. ""There's a big opening in the middle of the electorate, and Bloomberg is on point in that space.""Bloomberg aides say they are looking far more closely at the results of Super Tuesday, on March 1, when more states will vote in the primaries and it will be easier to gauge the strength of Hillary Clinton and others in the race.Related* Michael Bloomberg Mulling Run for President as Independent* Michael Bloomberg Acknowledges He Is Weighing Presidential BidBut the biggest hurdle to a Bloomberg bid may not hinge on the shifting fortunes of the other candidates, but on the former mayor's political brand. Mr. Bloomberg is a fiscally conservative technocrat with Wall Street roots, a liberal on many social issues, and a gun-control advocate. He identified as a Democrat but ran for mayor in 2001 as a Republican, and later as an independent.""He would have zero chance here,"" said Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, a swing state. Mr. Borges said he believed Mr. Bloomberg's positions on issues like gun control would be insurmountable.Other obstacles loom. Some conservative voters, particularly in the South, have criticized him for his positions on guns and for a measure in New York City, later turned aside by a court, to curb the sale of large, sugary drinks.Mr. Bloomberg would also likely face skepticism among Democrats, for his defense of big corporations and his record on race and policing. A police tactic he embraced known as ""stop-and-frisk"" was seen as unfairly targeting minorities and its use by the city was ruled unconstitutional in 2013 by a federal judge.Bloomberg aides said those handicaps could be overcome. One aide broke down Mr. Bloomberg's appeal this way: he is a political outsider unbeholden to party machinery; he has had private-sector success running Bloomberg LP, his data and media company; and he is a three-term mayor credited with revitalizing the nation's most populous city and driving down crime.""There is a degree of polarization, division and I daresay lack of focus on the major issues facing the country that is exemplified by the entire primary process to date. Including but not limited to New Hampshire,"" said Douglas E. Schoen, a longtime Bloomberg adviser who has conducted polls for the ex-mayor recently.Mr. Bloomberg has other potential advantages. He is worth more than $30 billion and has signaled he is ready to spend. One of his top political aides, Howard Wolfson, served as communications director for Mrs. Clinton's 2008 campaign. He has a stable of loyal aides ready to jump in.The campaign trail could be awkward for Mr. Bloomberg, who frequently grew irritated with the New York City press corps for asking personal questions about his life, including his weekend travels to his vacation homes. He isn't a natural campaigner, though his aides said he grew increasingly easy on the trail as the years passed. ""He was used to business groups, marketing professionals--the political media was a very different kind of thing,"" said Bill Cunningham, a former aide.A third-party candidate has never succeeded in winning the presidency, though they have shaped contests, Ralph Nader in 2000 being the most recent example. Entering the race late, Mr. Bloomberg would face challenges getting on ballots and building campaign machinery in each state.James McCann, a political- science professor at Purdue University who studies third-party bids, said Mr. Bloomberg faces an uphill battle. ""It still is difficult to come in from out of the blue and get the traction you need, even when things are really seemingly divisive and there's a great deal of disenchantment, even when you're a billionaire,"" he said.Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.comCredit: By Mara Gay and Josh Dawsey",2/11/16
"Next Task for Clinton, Sanders: Securing the Minority Vote; Is Bernie Sanders's appeal broad enough, or will Hillary Clinton prevail with the help of blacks, hispanics?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764229381?accountid=12768,"Democrats headed south and west after Sen. Bernie Sanders's resounding New Hampshire victory over Hillary Clinton, facing the twin questions of whether his appeal is broad enough to replicate his performance elsewhere--and whether her support is strong enough to reverse the tide.Lying at the crossroads of those two questions are the minority voters who have transformed the Democratic Party in the past few decades and hold the promise of sustained success in the future.Mr. Sanders's first act after his 22-point victory in predominantly white New Hampshire was to travel to Harlem in New York on Wednesday and have breakfast with high-profile civil-rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton.In an interview, Rev. Sharpton said that by coming to Harlem after ""such a big victory,"" Mr. Sanders ""wanted to send a signal"" to the party's minority voters. ""She has deeper ties [to the black community] and longstanding friends,"" Mr. Sharpton said of Mrs. Clinton, ""but that doesn't mean he can't win voters.""Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign arranged a conference call Wednesday with prominent African-American figures who support the former secretary of state. They cast Mr. Sanders as an arriviste who has ignored issues important to African-Americans.""It's good to have new friends--I would prefer to have true friends,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), who plans to go to South Carolina to campaign for Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton now is calling on the Clinton network of African-American supporters, looking to shore up the ""firewall"" her campaign says it has built in coming contests in South Carolina and other Southern states with large minority populations. The campaign is also tapping into her Hispanic network to sway Nevada voters.On primary night, the Clinton campaign understood that a defeat was coming in the Granite State. But the breadth of the loss left some of her supporters rattled and former President Bill Clinton angry, according to two people familiar with his thinking.Mr. Sanders beat her among women voters and won every age category save for voters over 65. He bested Mrs. Clinton not only among independents who participated in the primary--and by a lopsided margin--but topped her among Democratic Party members, 52% to 48%, exit polls showed.That could prove important, as the next primaries and caucuses will have far larger shares of Democrats and smaller shares of independents, who are barred entirely from party primaries in some states. Some 58% of voters in the New Hampshire primary were Democrats. By contrast, Democrats accounted for 81% of Nevada caucus-goers and 73% of South Carolina primary voters during the last competitive contests, in 2008.But Mr. Sanders's strength within the party's membership remains an open question. Mrs. Clinton carried Democratic Party members by 17 points in her narrow victory in Iowa's caucuses last week. And the Democrats in contests to come won't look like those in New Hampshire. Where 93% of New Hampshire's Democratic primary voters were white, only 43% of South Carolina primary voters and 65% of Nevada caucus-goers in 2008 were white.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 news.* New Hampshire Exit Polls Show Anxious Voters Eager for Change* Sanders Out-Raises Clinton in Silicon Valley* Donald Trump Triumphs in New Hampshire Republican Primary* Focus in the Republican Race Will Soon Shift to South Carolina* Hillary Clinton Finds Young Female Voters' Support Elusive* New Hampshire Exit Polls by the Numbers* Photos From the Race in New HampshireThe New Hampshire primary didn't test one of the most important features of the coming contests--whether Mrs. Clinton is retaining the substantial advantages she has shown among African-American and Hispanic voters in opinion polls. She led Mr. Sanders by 42 percentage points among nonwhite voters--69% to 27%--in Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling in early January.Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are planning to fan out in South Carolina in advance of the state's primary on Feb. 27, talking up Mrs. Clinton's credentials in a state where African-Americans account for more than half of the Democratic electorate.""I'm going to preach and teach, tell people to get out and vote for Hillary,"" said Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), who was beaten by state troopers in Selma, Ala., in 1965 during a voting-rights protest.Rep. Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.), the chairman of the black caucus's political-action committee, said that the group's board last week overwhelmingly voted to endorse Mrs. Clinton. Their formal announcement is expected on Thursday.Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, noted that the contests on March 1 include Texas, Alabama and Georgia--states with substantial ""communities of color.""But Mr. Sanders is ceding no ground as his campaign has gained momentum. He won the endorsement of former NAACP President Ben Jealous, and he is about to roll out an ad that shows him marching with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1963 March on Washington, according to former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Richard Harpootlian.""His bona fides are beyond question on civil rights, so older African-American voters as they see the TV commercial or radio ad will understand he's not some newcomer to their cause,"" Mr. Harpootlian said.The tug of war between the Clinton and Sanders camps is putting pressure on one of South Carolina's most prominent officials to come forward with an endorsement.Rep. Jim Clyburn, the only Democrat in South Carolina's delegation and a civil-rights leader with big sway in the state, has stayed neutral, but he may be coming off the fence soon, people familiar with the matter said.""I'm feeling it,"" said Mr. Clyburn, declining to say whom he might endorse. ""I have a wife and three daughters"" and ""they are telling me that I need to take a stand.""Valerie Bauerlein contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Siobhan Hughes",2/11/16

Mr. Sharpton said the breakfast lasted 20 minutes and that the senator's visit sent the right message to the black community.Mr. Sharpton said he asked Mr. Sanders about the water crisis in Flint, Mich. , affirmative action and police misconduct.""My concern is that in January of next year, for the first time in American history, a black family will be moving out of the White House,"" Mr. Sharpton said.

After a quick wave to the crowd, the senator departed in his car after the breakfast. Yo Akalu, a 27-year-old CUNY student, didn't believe the visit was genuine.""If he really wants our votes he really needs to come into these projects, he really needs to go into these schools, he really needs to speak to these families,"" Ms. Akalu said.

Explaining Bernie's 'Socialism'; He perfects the strategy of denying the funding dilemma of the welfare state.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763851327?accountid=12768,"In the 1940s, many Western societies began adopting single-payer health systems as a way to expand access to the relatively few things medical care at the time could do for patients.This was an agenda that, for obvious reason, could appeal to both consumers and providers of health care.We live in a different time. If the U.S. were to embark on a single-payer system today, as Bernie Sanders proposes, it would not be doing so to expand access--though that slogan would still be used--but for a very different reason: to deny and limit care in order to control spending.This agenda would be popular with neither patients nor providers, and therefore would be dead in the water--as liberal authorities, from the New York Times's Paul Krugman to Henry J. Aaron of the Brookings Institution, have suddenly discovered an urgency to point out to Democratic voters infatuated with Bernie Sanders.Mr. Sanders knows it too. His socialism is farcical in a country that can't afford the entitlements it already has.The one zinger that has found its mark during the current campaign has been Chelsea Clinton's claim that his plan endangers Medicare, which Mr. Sanders now brings up constantly in order to refute it. Mr. Sanders knows that seniors aren't stupid. They vote, and if they took his plan seriously, they would turn out in droves to protect Medicare from being raided by other age groups.Take another farcical element of Mr. Sanders's farcical socialism. He tweaks Hillary over $675,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. Unmentioned by the scourge of big money is Bill Clinton's far more egregious buckraking.By the estimate of IBT Media, Mr. Clinton collected between $54 million and $141 million from governments and arms manufacturers who had arms-deal approvals pending before his wife's State Department. His own disclosures indicate at least $20 million in speaking fees from banks and businesses since his wife began publicly eyeing the presidency.A Washington Post investigation finds a ""substantial overlap between the Clinton political machinery and the [charitable] foundation"" and that ""many of the foundation's biggest donors are foreigners who are legally barred from giving to U.S. political candidates.""Yet all this goes unremarked by Mr. Sanders, that ferocious denouncer of monied corruption. Why? For the same reason that Bill Clinton's reckless influence-peddling goes uniformly uncriticized inside the Democratic Party. Because that's the price of Mr. Clinton forgetting what a Clinton presidency was all about.He enacted welfare reform. He spoke enthusiastically of fully funded personal Social Security accounts. He speculated about the possibility of converting Medicare into a means-tested program of private insurance vouchers.This Bill Clinton you don't hear from anymore. One could easily forget he's not only the last, but the most prominent, of the once-numerous Blue Dog Democrats, who did not make a profession, as their party does now, of ignoring the long-term funding dilemma of the U.S. retirement programs.Mr. Sanders, far from being a radical departure, is merely a perfection of what Democrats have offered since the Clinton era, namely denial.Ignore the problem. If forced to acknowledge it, insist there's no problem because the rich will pay. In the meantime, savage every reform proposal as an attack on ""unmet needs."" Collect the political rents from serving as defender of every spending interest in our overcommitted republic.When pressed, even Bernie admits that some additional, unspecified ""political revolution"" would be necessary before his socialist plans became actionable in America. Meanwhile, what would a President Bernie do in office? You already have the answer.With the latest report of the Social Security and Medicare Trustees, the programs' unfunded liabilities, in present value terms, are $60 trillion. The worker-to-retiree ratio, which was 5.0 when Medicare was created in the mid-1960s, today is 2.5, and headed for less than 2.0 after 2030. Left out of this calculation, of course, is the growing rank of non-retired entitlement recipients whom taxpayers must also support.You don't hear about any of this from Democrats. One reason is that Bill Clinton, the most active, ubiquitous of our ex-presidents, has utterly dropped the subject in return for his party's indulgence of his fundraising that knows no limits, and no concern about propriety or conflicts of interest.You don't hear much about it from Republicans either. The Bill Clinton years may leave much to be criticized, but when both parties acknowledged a reality, there was at least a chance of doing something about it. That ended in 2000, when fully one-fifth of Al Gore's convention delegates were public-sector union representatives, placed there to quash any mention of entitlement reform in the Democratic platform.And that suits a lot of Democrats just fine, including Bernie, who, for all his exotic pretenses, is just another machine Democrat.Credit: By Holman W.

"Hillary Clinton's Wall Street Dilemma; Pushed by rival Bernie Sanders, Democratic front-runner struggles to justify money from the financial industry",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762586632?accountid=12768,"In the battle for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders is focused on turning Hillary Clinton's support from the financial industry, one of her longtime political assets, into a weapon against her.Mr. Sanders has targeted Mrs. Clinton's close relationship with Wall Street, saying her history of taking money from big banks and hedge funds shows she isn't a progressive. The charge has helped Mr. Sanders gain traction with a Democratic electorate uneasy with the power of wealthy firms.Mrs. Clinton, who has struggled to justify the money she has received from Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and other Wall Street firms over the years, said Wednesday during a televised CNN candidate forum in New Hampshire that she accepted fees of more than $200,000 per speech because ""that's what they offered.""Mr. Sanders said at the event, ""I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15 million from Wall Street.""The two of them continued to trade barbs at a Democratic debate Thursday night . ""You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation I ever received,"" Mrs. Clinton said in defending her ties to Wall Street. She accused Mr. Sanders of an ""artful smear.""Other prominent Democrats, including President Barack Obama in 2008, have combined a friendly relationship with the financial world with attacks on big-moneyed interests.But no Democrat or Republican running for president this year has received as much money from Wall Street executives for their campaigns as Mrs. Clinton has. Wall Street is the top donor to her 2016 presidential campaign and to a super PAC run by Mrs. Clinton's allies to support her candidacy. Only the super PAC supporting Republican Jeb Bush has raised more on Wall Street.More broadly, since Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton entered national politics in the early 1990s, Wall Street has contributed more than $100 million to their political campaigns, charitable foundation and personal finances, according to a review by The Wall Street Journal.Financial-services firms accounted for about 12% of the total amount raised by the Clintons during their more than two decades in politics.Some Wall Street money has helped the couple's personal finances. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other Wall Street firms have paid the Clintons more than $20 million in speaking fees over the years.Many on Wall Street say they favor Mrs. Clinton because they agree with her on a range of topics--and because they believe she will take their views into account if she pursues stepped-up regulations on financial services firms, according to interviews with more than two dozen executives.Concerns over the nomination of either Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or New York businessman Donald Trump have prompted some Republicans on Wall Street to consider Mrs. Clinton as the better alternative. Many, however, say they are leaning toward Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who appeals to business-oriented Republicans.Clinton aides dismiss talk that Mrs. Clinton is too cozy with the financial industry. ""She went to Wall Street before the crash and warned them that what they were doing could hurt the economy and called them out on it,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Thursday. ""She has introduced the strongest plan in this race...It actually deals with the swaps and derivatives that led to this crash.""Mrs. Clinton's plan seeks to build on the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to strengthen oversight of the banking sector and unregulated ""shadow banking"" activities that played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis. She has also proposed a tax on certain types of high-frequency trading--automated stock trading by computers that has been profitable but can cause excessive volatility--and has pitched a so-called risk fee on the biggest financial firms.Still, there is a general feeling that ""she's not going to come after Wall Street,"" said a Clinton super PAC donor who has spoken to dozens of potential supporters.The widespread view on Wall Street, say executives, is that Mrs. Clinton, driven by pragmatic considerations, doesn't see financial firms as inherently bad and is willing to work on solutions.Mrs. Clinton's supporters say she is able to push for higher middle-class incomes without demonizing the wealthy.""Even for a lot of people on Wall Street, the concept of equality resonates,"" said David Lichtenstein, a real estate investor who hosted a fundraiser last month for Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton's supporters say her campaign talk about reining in banks, curbing excessive risk-taking and punishing individuals for financial wrongdoing reflects a negative voter mood.""She moved to the left because she needed some political cover in her fight against Sanders,"" said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at asset manager Horizon Investments. ""Her plan may be aggressive, but her ties to Wall Street make it unlikely that this proposal of hers will be a top priority...it's the cynical view.""Clinton advisers said she would closely police Wall Street as president.""People on Wall Street have been supporting her not because they think she's going to roll over on Wall Street, but because they agree with her on other issues outside of Wall Street,"" said Thomas Nides, a former deputy secretary of State under Mrs. Clinton and now vice chairman of Morgan Stanley.While her husband's administration was stocked with Wall Street veterans, the Clintons' connections with the finance community grew in 1999, when they bought a home in Chappaqua, an affluent suburb of New York City.At the time, Mrs. Clinton and her husband were linked with a centrist, pro-business wing of the Democratic Party that didn't seek to alienate Wall Street. Supporters described them as a celebrity couple, charming New York's financial community and blending into summers in the Hamptons, the Long Island community of beach towns where many rich New Yorkers keep homes.""He was the former president and she was the former first lady,"" Mr. Nides said. ""She was already a well-known commodity, and people wanted to be with her.""As the couple expanded their Wall Street network, hedge-fund managers, bankers and wealthy investors wrote checks to the Clinton Foundation philanthropy and agreed to host fundraisers in their homes for Mrs. Clinton's budding political career. Many were pleasantly surprised to receive handwritten thank-you notes, flowers or phone calls from the couple.Now, engaged in a presidential primary, Mrs. Clinton is finding these relationships, so helpful in the past, a point of vulnerability.In the run-up to Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders has sharpened his attacks on Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street. At campaign stops around the state, he paints her as an establishment figure incapable of overhauling the political system to benefit everyday American families.Campaign finance reports made public this week show Mrs. Clinton leads all others in financial support from Wall Street. Through the end of 2015, Wall Street had donated $2.9 million to Mrs. Clinton's election campaign and $55,226 to the campaign of Mr. Sanders.Among Republicans, Wall Street donors have contributed a total of about $2 million to Messrs. Cruz, Rubio and Trump.A super PAC run by Mrs. Clinton's supporters has collected an additional $14.3 million from Wall Street, a total surpassed only by the super PAC set up to back Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor. Mr. Sanders doesn't have a major super PAC supporting his campaign; a super PAC run by a nurses union has spent nearly $1 million on his behalf.Overall, Wall Street accounted for about a third of the funds the Clinton super PAC raised last year. Billionaire investor George Soros gave the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action, $6 million in December, bringing his total donations to the group to $7 million.The newly released campaign finance filings show Mrs. Clinton raised the most money among the presidential candidates from just about every industry tracked by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.In all, donations from the financial-services sector make up a large and growing share of the amount of money raised in U.S. elections. Through the end of 2015, money from financial services firms made up roughly 40% of the $1 billion donated so far into the 2016 election, compared with less than 20% of the total in 2012 and 5% in 2008.Rebecca Ballhaus, Peter Nicholas and Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Write to Anupreeta Das at anupreeta.das@wsj.com and Brody Mullins at brody.mullins@wsj.comCredit: By Anupreeta Das and Brody Mullins",2/11/16

"Hillary Clinton's Wall Street Talks Were Highly Paid, Friendly; Democratic presidential candidate has been criticized by rival Bernie Sanders for her ties to financial sector",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764483116?accountid=12768,"In the two years between resigning as secretary of state and launching her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton personally received $4.1 million in fees from financial institutions for closed-door talks that attendees described as friendly and light.Today, the speeches have become an issue in her campaign. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her rival in the Democratic primary, has repeatedly attacked her ties to Wall Street, including her large speech fees.Most of Mrs. Clinton's comments steered clear of anything that could become controversial in her fight for the Democratic nomination, say people who attended some of these events or were briefed on them. She didn't often talk about the financial crisis, but when she did, she almost always struck an amicable tone, according to these people.In some cases, she thanked the audience for what they had done for the country, the people said. One attendee said the warmth with which Mrs. Clinton greeted guests bordered on ""gushy.""In a discussion with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives and some of its asset-management clients in October 2013, she spoke sympathetically about the financial industry, according to an attendee. Asked about the poisoned national mood toward Wall Street, Mrs. Clinton didn't single out bankers or any other group for causing the 2008 financial crisis. Instead, she effectively said, ""We're all in this together, we've got to find our way out of it together,"" according to the attendee.Mrs. Clinton has said she would look into releasing the contents of her talks, many of which were transcribed by a stenographer that she requested be present. Her team is reviewing transcripts from dozens of speeches to assess potential pitfalls of releasing them to the public, people close to Mrs. Clinton said.Some in the Clinton camp are concerned that comments not just about Wall Street, but also on the health-care law and foreign leaders could be taken out of context in an election season, they added.A campaign spokesman declined to comment on whether transcripts would be released.Mr. Sanders, in his attacks on Mrs. Clinton, has questioned why firms such as Goldman paid her $225,000 a speech. When asked at a CNN event last week to explain why she was paid these sums, Mrs. Clinton said, ""I don't know, that's what they offered.""The fees and other details were negotiated on behalf of Mrs. Clinton by the Harry Walker Agency, a speakers' bureau that represented her. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment. Mrs. Clinton's profile page was missing from its website as of last week.Beginning in early 2013, after leaving the State Department, Mrs. Clinton embarked on a two-year speaking career, making $21.7 million from about 100 speeches to universities, economic clubs, trade groups, investment banks, private-equity firms and several Canadian entities.About one in five dollars that Mrs. Clinton collected while giving speeches from February 2013 to April 2015 came from banks and financial institutions.She spoke at three client conferences hosted by Goldman Sachs; twice at Deutsche Bank AG; once each at events organized by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and UBS; and also at gatherings hosted by private-equity firms KKR & Co., Apollo Management Holdings LP and GTCR LLC.The Goldman alternative investments conference, where she also addressed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, was one of the few times Mrs. Clinton directly addressed questions about the financial crisis when speaking to Wall Street firms, according to people familiar with the matter. She said Dodd-Frank was working, but that there were ways it could be strengthened, the people said.More often, Mrs. Clinton was asked about her four-year term as secretary of state, with people in the financial community curious to know what she thought of foreign leaders, U.S. foreign policy and whether she planned to run for president in 2016, said people familiar with the matter.In April 2013, Mrs. Clinton was invited by Morgan Stanley to speak to clients of its fixed-income business at a conference dinner at the Library of Congress. During a 20-minute question-and-answer session, Thomas Nides, a Morgan Stanley vice chairman who had just returned to the bank after working as Mrs. Clinton's deputy in the State Department, lobbed what people familiar with the session described as gentle questions at his former boss.Mrs. Clinton recounted the events leading to the capture of Osama bin Laden, among other topics. At the end of the event, she posed for photographs with attendees, as stipulated in her contract. Little was said about the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the conversation. The bank paid her $225,000.Although some of her paid speeches were open to the public, those she made to financial firms were confidential. The contracts sent around by Mrs. Clinton's agency to these and other firms usually included extensive stipulations. They barred audio and video recordings, as well as broadcasts.High-profile political speakers often ban recordings, but Mrs. Clinton was unusual in requiring that a stenographer be present to record and transcribe her remarks. In these cases, she had the sole right to distribute the transcripts.Many of the events hosted by the financial firms were moderated discussions or Q&A sessions; in some, Mrs. Clinton typically made prepared remarks before taking questions from the audience.In late October 2013, she sat down for an evening Q&A with Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs. The audience at the Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain, right outside Tucson, Ariz., was mostly technology entrepreneurs and senior Goldman executives. Mr. Blankfein started out by asking Mrs. Clinton for a ""survey of the world,"" according to an attendee and a person briefed on the matter.She told the audience how world leaders often asked her why politics in the nation's capital had become so gridlocked, saying it was hurting the U.S.'s reputation abroad.Credit: By Anupreeta Das and James V.

"Trump, Sanders and the American Rebellion; As institutions lose respect, voters think: Let's take a chance.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764468096?accountid=12768,"What is happening in American politics?We're in the midst of a rebellion. The bottom and middle are pushing against the top. It's a throwing off of old claims and it's been going on for a while, but we're seeing it more sharply after New Hampshire. This is not politics as usual, which by its nature is full of surprise. There's something deep, suggestive, even epochal about what's happening now.I have thought for some time that there's a kind of soft French Revolution going on in America, with the angry and blocked beginning to push hard against an oblivious elite. It is not only political. Yes, it is about the Democratic National Committee, that house of hacks, and about a Republican establishment owned by the donor class. But establishment journalism, which for eight months has been simultaneously at Donald Trump's feet (""Of course you can call us on your cell from the bathtub for your Sunday show interview!"") and at his throat (""Trump supporters, many of whom are nativists and nationalists . . ."") is being rebelled against too. Their old standing as guides and gatekeepers? Gone, and not only because of multiplying platforms. Gloria Steinem thought she owned feminism, thought she was feminism. She doesn't and isn't. The Clintons thought they owned the party--they don't. Hedge-funders thought they owned the GOP. Too bad they forgot to buy the base!All this goes hand in hand with the general decline of America's faith in its institutions. We feel less respect for almost all of them--the church, the professions, the presidency, the Supreme Court. The only formal national institution that continues to score high in terms of public respect (72% in the most recent Gallup poll) is the military.A few years ago I gave a lecture to a class at West Point, the text of which was: You are entering the only U.S. institution left standing. Your prime responsibility throughout your careers will be to keep it respected. I then told them about the Dreyfus case. They had not heard of it. I explained how that scandal rocked public faith in a previously exalted institution, the French army, doing it and France lasting damage. And so your personal integrity is of the utmost importance, I said, as day by day that integrity creates the integrity of the military. The cadets actually listened to that part.I mention this to say we are in a precarious position in the U.S. with so many of our institutions going down. Many of those pushing against the system have no idea how precarious it is or what they will be destroying. Those defending it don't know how precarious its position is or even what they're defending, or why. But people lose respect for a reason.To New Hampshire: The rejection of the establishment's preferred candidates in both major parties is a big moment. It is also understandable, the result of 15 years of failed presidencies. It is a gesture of rebuke toward the political class--move aside.It's said this is the year of anger but there's a kind of grim practicality to Trump and Sanders supporters. They're thinking: Let's take a chance. Washington is incapable of reform or progress; it's time to reach outside. Let's take a chance on an old Brooklyn socialist. Let's take a chance on the casino developer who talks on TV.In doing so, they accept a decline in traditional political standards. You don't have to have a history of political effectiveness anymore; you don't even have to have run for office! ""You're so weirdly outside the system, you may be what the system needs.""They are pouring their hope into uncertain vessels, and surely know it. Bernie Sanders is an actual radical: He would fundamentally change an economic system that imperfectly but for two centuries made America the wealthiest country in the history of the world. In the young his support is understandable: They have never been taught anything good about capitalism and in their lifetimes have seen it do nothing--nothing--to protect its own reputation.It is middle-aged Sanders supporters who are more interesting. They know what they're turning their backs on. They know they're throwing in the towel. My guess is they're thinking something like: Don't aim for great now, aim for safe. Terrorism, a world turning upside down, my kids won't have it better--let's just try to be safe, more communal.A shrewdness in Sanders and Trump backers: They share one faith in Washington, and that is in its ability to wear anything down. They think it will moderate Bernie, take the edges off Trump. For thus reason they don't see their choices as so radical.As for Mr. Trump, it is not without meaning that his supporters have had eight months to measure the cost of satisfying their anger by voting for him. In New Hampshire, 35% of the electorate decided that for all his drama and uncertainty they would back him.The mainstream journalistic mantra is that the GOP is succumbing to nativism, nationalism and the culture of celebrity. That allows them to avoid taking seriously Mr. Trump's issues: illegal immigration and Washington's 15-year, bipartisan refusal to stop it; political correctness and how it is strangling a free people; and trade policies that have left the American working class displaced, adrift and denigrated. Mr. Trump's popularity is propelled by those issues and enabled by his celebrity.In winning, Donald Trump threw over the GOP donor class. Political professionals don't fully appreciate that, but normal Americans see it. They get that the guy with money just slapped silly the guys with money. Every hedge-fund billionaire donor should be blinking in pain. Some investment!This leads me to Citizens United. Conservatives applauded that Supreme Court decision because it allowed Republicans to counter the effect of union money that goes to Democrats. But Citizens United gave the rich too much sway in the GOP. The party was better off when it relied on Main Street. It meant they had to talk to Main Street.Mr. Trump is a clever man with his finger on the pulse, but his political future depends on two big questions. The first is: Is he at all a good man? Underneath the foul mouthed flamboyance is he in it for America? The second: Is he fully stable? He acts like a nut, calling people bimbos, flying off the handle with grievances. Is he mature, reliable? Is he at all a steady hand?Political professionals think these are side questions. ""Let's accuse him of not being conservative!"" But they are the issue. Because America doesn't deliberately elect people it thinks base, not to mention crazy.Anyway, we are in some kind of moment. Congratulations to the establishments of both parties for getting us here. They are the authors of the rebellion; they are a prime thing being rebelled against.Connected to that, something I've noticed. In Washington there used to be a widespread cliché: ""God protects drunks, children and the United States of America."" I'm in Washington a lot, and I've noticed no one says that anymore. They stopped 10 or 15 years ago. I wonder what that means.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",2/12/16

GOP Groups Target Sanders; Republican super PACs say they are taking Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders seriously enough to attack him,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764813098?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton has long been the subject of Republican attacks. It looks like rival Bernie Sanders may soon start to feel the burn, too.It's a perverse sort of compliment, really. Republican super PACs say they are now taking the Vermont senator seriously enough to attack him. The attacks focus on the fact that Mr. Sanders is a democratic socialist, though they generally leave out the ""democratic"" part.That would be a significant vulnerability for Mr. Sanders in a general election, but competing for liberal voters in a Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton hasn't touched it. A Boston Globe poll last weekend found that nearly a third of Democratic voters in New Hampshire said the term ""socialist"" applied to them.Not necessarily so with the larger electorate. On Wednesday, the day after Mr. Sanders's resounding victory in the New Hampshire primary, Tom Donohue, president of the Chamber of Commerce, posted his ""thoughts"" about Mr. Sanders's victory to the Chamber's website. He declared the senator's economic views to be wholly ""misguided.""""Socialism is a wrong and dangerous path for America. It's failed everywhere it's ever been tried, bringing shared misery instead of shared prosperity,"" he wrote.That is downright quaint compared with a digital ad released Thursday from the Republican group America Rising Squared, a nonprofit organization that doesn't have to disclose its donors.The ad repeatedly uses the word ""socialist"" and uses ominous images of war, Soviet flags and terrorists to paint a frightening picture of America under Mr. Sanders. It shows a younger (and even wilder-haired) Mr. Sanders praising Cuba's Fidel Castro and airs recent footage of him saying, ""We will raise taxes, yes we will.""And on Friday, the super PAC Future45 released an ad to run on cable television nationally and in Nevada. The ad actually advertises some of the ideas that Mr. Sanders is proud of: a $15 minimum wage, a higher taxes on banks and corporations and free (the ad puts ""free"" into quotes) college and health care.Some GOP groups have been airing TV ads that are actually meant to boost Mr. Sanders at the expense of Mrs. Clinton. But this time, Future45 says it is aiming at the Vermont senator, fearful he will skate by for too long without criticism from the right.""No one took Obama seriously at first when he ran in 2008,"" said Dan Conston, senior adviser to Future 45, ""and we're not going to make that mistake.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler",2/13/16
"Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton Cross Paths in Nevada; Democratic presidential candidates visit same church, aim to drum up support from African-Americans",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765049011?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS, Nev.--The two Democratic candidates for president crossed paths on the campaign trail Sunday, making back-to-back appearances at a historically black church in west Las Vegas.Locked in a tight battle for the Democratic nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have turned the bulk of their attention to shoring up support from black and Latino voters, two voting blocs that will play a key role in the next two Democratic nominating contests.The two candidates spoke to parishioners at the Victory Missionary Baptist Church on Sunday, both offering brief remarks to a crowd of more than 500 people.""We thank God our church, in this political system, is singled out today to have both presidential candidates,"" said Pastor Robert E. Fowler Sr.Mrs. Clinton was introduced by Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and civil-rights icon who delivered a strong endorsement.Election 2016* Bernie Sanders Strives to Win Over Skeptical Blacks in South Carolina* Clinton Seeks to Maximize Her Support Among Blacks* GOP Hopefuls Take Gloves Off at South Carolina Debate* Jeb Bush Embraces Family Ahead of South Carolina Primary""If there is one person ready to be president, day one, this woman. She's been a senator, secretary of state. Look, she is prepared, she is ready, Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Lewis told churchgoers about Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders stuck to an abbreviated version of his stump speech in a brief appearance in church on Sunday. He then traveled across town to a raucous rally at a Las Vegas high school, where he predicted a victory next weekend if his supporters turned out to the polls.""If people come out in large numbers on caucus day, we're going to win,"" he told cheering supporters.The challenge for Mr. Sanders is to improve his standing among nonwhite voters in advance of the Feb. 20 Nevada caucuses and the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary. Latinos make up about a quarter of the population in Nevada, while African-Americans make up nearly 30% in South Carolina and play an outsize role in the Democratic primary.Mr. Sanders fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa and won a resounding victory in New Hampshire last week. But both states are whiter and more rural than the country at large.Nevada hasn't been extensively polled in recent months, lending an air of unpredictability to the third Democratic presidential contest. But a recent South Carolina poll showed Mrs. Clinton with a 47-point lead over Mr. Sanders among black voters in the Palmetto State. National polls also show Mrs. Clinton with large leads among nonwhite voters, while Mr. Sanders wins big among white voters and younger voters.The crowd to see Mr. Sanders at the high school was so large that not everyone could fit into the venue. Mr. Sanders briefly spoke to those shut out of the rally using a megaphone before delivering his stump speech inside.""If we can win here in Nevada, we send a profound message to the entire country. And that message is that the people of this country will no longer accept establishment politics,"" Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders will campaign in Michigan on Monday and in Georgia on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton, who has been in Nevada since Saturday, also maintained a busy campaign schedule and is hosting an evening rally in Las Vegas.She is scheduled to travel to Elko and Reno on Monday, hoping to ramp up turnout in areas of the state outside of Las Vegas, the largest city.In another stop to speak to a group of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, Mrs. Clinton said the Supreme Court was the key to protecting many of President Barack Obama's immigration efforts. She said that the death this week of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has thrown the future of Mr. Obama's executive actions on immigration in doubt.A U.S. District Court last year blocked Mr. Obama's efforts to give millions of illegal immigrants legal status and work permits. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, where a tie among the remaining eight justices would keep the lower court decision in place, she said.""If there is no new justice appointed, then as with other cases before the Court, the decision that was decided will stay in place. And that was a bad decision. I disagreed with it.

Bernie Sanders have turned the bulk of their attention to shoring up support from black and Latino voters, two voting blocs that will play a key role in the next two Democratic nominating contests.The two candidates spoke to parishioners at the Victory Missionary Baptist Church on Sunday, both offering brief remarks to a crowd of more than 500 people.""We thank God our church, in this political system, is singled out today to have both presidential candidates,"" said Pastor Robert E. Fowler Sr.Mrs. Clinton was introduced by Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and civil-rights icon who delivered a strong endorsement.""If there is one person ready to be president, day one, this woman. She's been a senator, secretary of state. Look, she is prepared, she is ready, Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Lewis told churchgoers about Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders stuck to an abbreviated version of his stump speech in a brief appearance in church on Sunday. He then traveled across town to a raucous rally at a Las Vegas high school, where he predicted a victory next weekend if his supporters turned out to the polls.""If people come out in large numbers on caucus day, we're going to win,"" he told cheering supporters.The challenge for Mr. Sanders is to improve his standing among nonwhite voters in advance of the Feb. 20 Nevada caucuses and the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary. Latinos make up about a quarter of the population in Nevada, while African-Americans make up nearly 30% in South Carolina and play an outsize role in the Democratic primary.Mr. Sanders fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa and won a resounding victory in New Hampshire last week. But both states are whiter and more rural than the country at large.Nevada hasn't been extensively polled in recent months, lending an air of unpredictability to the third Democratic presidential contest. But a recent South Carolina poll showed Mrs. Clinton with a 47-point lead over Mr. Sanders among black voters in the Palmetto State. National polls also show Mrs. Clinton with large leads among nonwhite voters, while Mr. Sanders wins big among white voters and younger voters.The crowd to see Mr. Sanders at the high school was so large that not everyone could fit into the venue. Mr. Sanders briefly spoke to those shut out of the rally using a megaphone before delivering his stump speech inside.""If we can win here in Nevada, we send a profound message to the entire country. And that message is that the people of this country will no longer accept establishment politics,"" Mr. Sanders said.Mrs. Clinton, who has been in Nevada since Saturday, also maintained a busy campaign schedule and is hosting an evening rally in Las Vegas.She is scheduled to travel to Elko and Reno on Monday, hoping to ramp up turnout in areas of the state outside of Las Vegas, the state's largest city.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Byron Tau",2/14/16
Bernie Sanders Strives to Win Over Skeptical Blacks in South Carolina; Democratic presidential candidate focuses on income support in effort to draw minority support,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764955623?accountid=12768,"RENO, Nev.--Hillary Clinton has had 25 years to persuade black voters she is a reliable political ally. Bernie Sanders has had about 25 days to do the same.The Vermont senator comes from an overwhelmingly white state. Since entering the presidential race in May, he has spent the bulk of his time campaigning in a pair of states that are just about as white: New Hampshire and Iowa.Now that the first phase of the race is over and the contest is moving to Southern states with large black populations, Mr. Sanders is scrambling to introduce himself to voters who have little idea who he is.It has been a rocky path.His campaign on Saturday released an ad that will air in South Carolina in advance of the Feb. 27 primary . The Democratic electorate in South Carolina is more than 50% black. The 30-second spot opens with pictures of the Rev. Martin Luther King and includes black-and-white images of civil-rights marches in the 1960s.Related* Clinton Seeks to Maximize Her Support Among Blacks* What Would Happen if Bernie Sanders Taxed Wall Street?* Hillary Clinton Questions Bernie Sanders's Loyalty to Obama* Sanders's Record, Filings Show Benefits From Super PACs, Links to Wall Street Donors* Sanders Wins New Hampshire Democratic Primary* Bernie Sanders Out-Raises Hillary Clinton in Silicon Valley""Bernie Sanders: He was there when Dr. King marched on Washington,"" the narrator says.Two days ago, one of the icons of the civil-rights movement, Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), cast doubt on Mr. Sanders's record as a fighter for racial equality.Taking part in a Hillary Clinton endorsement event with fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Lewis said he ""never saw"" and ""never met"" Mr. Sanders during protests and marches. That was a blow delivered at an inopportune time: For Mr. Sanders to win the nomination he must demolish the ""firewall"" Mrs. Clinton's campaign says it has built on the strength of minority voters .As a student at the University of Chicago in the early 1960s, Mr. Sanders took part in protests against the school's segregated housing policies. He was in the crowd in 1963 when Rev. King gave his ""I have a Dream"" speech.On Saturday, Mr. Lewis tempered his comments. In a statement, he said he didn't mean to challenge Mr. Sanders's credentials. He said ""the fact that I did not meet him in the movement does not mean I doubted that Sen. Sanders participated in the civil-rights movement, neither was I attempting to disparage his activism.""Asked by reporters Saturday if the Clinton campaign is placing too much focus on race, Mr. Sanders bristled. He said that in 1988, when he was mayor of Burlington, Vt., he endorsed Jesse Jackson for the Democratic presidential nomination.""There were very, very, very few white public officials at that point who endorsed Jackson,"" Mr. Sanders said in a brief news conference before boarding a flight from Reno to Denver. ""But I thought what he was saying made sense. I had the courage to do that.""Campaigning in more racially diverse states, Mr. Sanders is recalibrating his message. He is talking more about race relations and emphasizing proposals that speak to the deepest concerns of black voters: youth unemployment, police brutality, and crime and punishment. He is denouncing the militarization of police departments and the paucity of banks and grocery stores in black neighborhoods.More than anything else, Mr. Sanders's candidacy is about the issue of income inequality--how wealth flows to the richest sliver of American households. Liberal white voters have embraced the message and fueled his rise in the polls.Now Mr. Sanders is drawing out the point, noting that a more even distribution of wealth would boost minority households, in particular.""When we talk about a rigged economy, where the rich get richer and almost everybody else gets poorer, it's important to understand that many, many people have gotten poorer,"" he said Saturday at a campaign forum in Reno. ""It has been the African-American community, the [Native-American] community, the indigenous community, the Latino community that has suffered the most.""He has had some success in attracting minority support, but progress has been uneven. On Friday night, Mr. Sanders took part in a forum on race in Minneapolis.The discussion was tense.Speakers pressed him to talk directly about the government paying reparations for slavery. They told him he was being too polite in discussing race.One woman spoke about her son who had gotten sick breathing fumes from city incinerators. ""My black son--I know you're scared to say, 'black,' I know you're scared to say, 'reparations.'""""Hold it, ma'am,"" Mr. Sanders said.

"Hillary Clinton Questions Bernie Sanders's Loyalty to Obama; In first presidential debate after split victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, candidates clash on cost of plans",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764504447?accountid=12768,"MILWAUKEE--Hillary Clinton pressed Bernie Sanders on the viability of his proposals for free health care and college tuition in a Democratic presidential debate Thursday, and questioned his loyalty to President Barack Obama for past statements calling the president weak and a disappointment.In a wide-ranging exchange, the first after the candidates split victories in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the Democratic contenders agreed with each other more than they disagreed and appealed to the minority voters who will play a larger role in the next two races, in South Carolina and Nevada.READ MORE ON CAPITAL JOURNAL* Recap: How the Debate Unfolded* Clinton's Wall Street Talks Were Highly Paid, Friendly* Marco Rubio Talks Up Foreign Policy Expertise* Kasich Places Big Bet on Midwest Support* New Hampshire Exit Polls by the NumbersMrs. Clinton tethered herself to Mr. Obama, who remains enormously popular with the African-American voters she is relying on to help her campaign. She cast herself as the keeper of his legacy, repeatedly injected praise for his record and attacked Mr. Sanders for criticism he has leveled against the president.""The kind of criticism we've heard from Sen. Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans--I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination,"" she said. ""That is a low blow,"" he replied, saying he has worked closely with Mr. Obama. But he added: ""Last I heard, we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard a U.S. senator had the right to disagree with the president. So I have voiced criticisms.""Mrs. Clinton said that disagreement was fine but Mr. Sanders went too far suggesting a primary challenge to him in 2011, calling him weak and a disappointment. The Vermont senator's final retort, harking back to the 2008 Democratic primary: ""One of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.""The debate elicited few surprises and revealed no significant change in tactics by either camp that could shift the dynamics of what appears to be a highly competitive fight for the Democratic Party presidential nomination that isn't likely to be resolved for months.Mr. Sanders didn't hesitate to stand by his proposal to impose new taxes on the wealthy and Wall Street to provide new government services. However, he appeared to have no reply when the former secretary of state pointed out that his education proposal would require Republican governors to spend more money to make it happen.Mr. Sanders's plan ""rests on making sure that governors, like Scott Walker [of Wisconsin], contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I'm a little skeptical,"" she said, to loud applause.An unexpected historical figure made his way into the debate: Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state and national security adviser under President Richard Nixon. Mr. Sanders sought to put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive, noting that she has said she has taken advice from Mr. Kissinger and citing his role in the secret bombings of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.""I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I'm proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.""Mrs. Clinton struck back, seeking to portray Mr. Sanders as unprepared for the world's foreign policy challenges. ""Journalists have asked, who do you listen to on policy and we have yet to know who that is,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger, that's for sure,"" Mr. Sanders said.While the exchange seemed an unusual detour, the Sanders campaign followed it with a memo to reporters detailing its view on Kissinger's policies.The debate opened with a tense exchange over one of the pair's sharpest policy differences--Mr. Sanders's proposal to create a single-payer health-care system that would replace private insurance with a government-funded system.Mr. Sanders said it is imperative for the U.S. to guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege. Mrs. Clinton questioned his assertion that a typical American family will see $500 more in taxes while saving $5,000 in health-care costs.""The numbers don't add up,"" she said. ""That's a promise that cannot be kept.""Mr. Sanders responded by speaking of a general imperative. ""Here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton replied that the U.S. system is fundamentally different from European countries, which have government systems, and that the Affordable Care Act was meant to build on the employer-based system in place.Mrs. Clinton suggested that her opponent was promising more than he could deliver as president and would plunge the country back into another protracted debate over health care: ""We have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why we should not make promises we can't keep.""She said she has specified what her proposals would cost--$100 billion a year. ""Once I'm in the White House, we will have enough political capital"" to close tax loopholes and raise taxes on wealthy Americans--steps that would pay for her programs, she said.In reply, Mr. Sanders seized on her prediction that she will be the next president. ""Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet,"" he said. He didn't put a dollar amount on his proposals, which research by The Wall Street Journal suggests would cost about $1.7 trillion a year.The candidates also clashed on their records on immigration, particularly given that they agree on the need for a path to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally.Mr. Sanders defended his 2007 vote against a comprehensive immigration bill, echoing the concerns held by unions, who have long worried that an influx of immigrants would compete for low-wage jobs. He said he voted no because he didn't like a guest worker program in the bill.But the Vermont senator went on the offense regarding the Obama administration's decision to send home children and families from Central America, who flooded the southern border in the summer of 2014. Mrs. Clinton sided with the administration, saying it was important to discourage more children from making the dangerous journey to the U.S. border.Mr. Sanders renewed his call for a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws, saying, ""bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people; if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president"" to try to resolve the issue.On the issue of race, both candidates pledged to create new opportunities and address inequities.Mr. Sanders decried a broken criminal justice system that he said allows mass incarcerations and ""kids getting arrested."" Mrs. Clinton spoke about the challenges African-Americans face and said she would ""tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans"" by addressing a wide range of issues, from jobs to criminal justice reform.Thursday's matchup came on the heels of Mr. Sanders's convincing win in the New Hampshire primary, where he won more women in every age bracket except those 45 years and older.When asked why she didn't garner broader appeal, Mrs. Clinton demurred. ""I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support,"" she said. ""I just hope that by the end of this campaign, there will be a lot more supporting me.""Mrs. Clinton declined to agree or disagree with the controversial comment from one of her supporters, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who said there was ""a special place in hell"" for women who don't support one another. She noted instead that her friend had been saying that for many years.Mr. Sanders was asked if he was worried that he might be standing in the way of a historic achievement: election of the first woman president. He replied that given his background and views--he says he's a democratic socialist--""a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well.""The Clinton campaign is counting on states with more diverse electorates to create an election-race firewall that halts Mr. Sanders's rise, but both campaigns are preparing for a prolonged battle, stretching into March and perhaps beyond.Polls taken before the New Hampshire primary showed Mrs. Clinton with double-digit leads in Nevada and South Carolina, but Mr. Sanders has moved quickly this week to capitalize on his win and build support among minority voters.Both Democratic contenders have rolled out endorsements from African-American officials and celebrities in recent days. On Thursday, the political arm of Congressional Black Caucus threw their support to Mrs. Clinton, and entertainer Harry Belafonte endorsed Mr. Sanders in a video message.Mr. Sanders's decisive victory in New Hampshire highlighted the resonance of his call for a political revolution and his argument that a rigged economy is unfairly benefiting Wall Street and the wealthy.He hit upon those themes again Thursday, saying that his campaign's success was evidence that the American people are tired of establishment politics and establishment economics.""They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors,"" Mr. Sanders said.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com , Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Laura Meckler and Peter Nicholas",2/15/16
Bernie Sanders Out-Raises Hillary Clinton in Silicon Valley; Vermont senator's presidential campaign picks up supporters at largest tech companies,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763850462?accountid=12768,"SAN FRANCISCO--Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders is seeing a surge of financial support from companies in Silicon Valley and is now out-raising presidential rival Hillary Clinton at the largest tech firms there, a boost that likely helped the Vermont senator's fundraising outpace Mrs. Clinton's last month.In the last three months of 2015, Mr. Sanders drew nearly $105,000 from employees at the five largest technology companies in Silicon Valley. That was about four times the amount he raised from those firms in the first quarter of his campaign, and almost $10,000 more than Mrs. Clinton raised over the same period from employees at the same firms, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.The former secretary of state's fundraising among Silicon Valley firms, meanwhile, has stayed steady over the course of the year, suggesting that Mr. Sanders is turning out donors there who were not previously making political contributions.Mrs. Clinton's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Of the top 20 employers donating to the Sanders campaign in 2015, almost half were technology firms, including Google, Apple and Microsoft, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.Manfred Georg, a 33-year-old software engineer at Google, said Mr. Sanders's message resonates with him. ""I want things to be fair, and I feel the system, as it is, is not,"" he said. ""I have done particularly well, and I have a lot of these advantages. ... If you don't have them, it's really hard to get ahead."" Mr. Georg gave nearly $2,000 to the campaign in December and also participated in a phone bank earlier this year.Following Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, the path to the nomination becomes harder for the Vermont senator. He is trailing Mrs. Clinton in South Carolina and Nevada, the next states to hold nominating contests, and lags behind her by more than 10 points nationally. A surge in financial support--particularly from Silicon Valley, which has historically been a cash cow for Democratic candidates--could help him navigate the months ahead.In January, Mr. Sanders out-raised Mrs. Clinton for the first time, by $5 million. The campaigns aren't required to disclose their donors for January until later this month.Mr. Sanders's success in Silicon Valley is also notable because of the relative lack of effort his campaign has put in there. While Mrs. Clinton has regularly visited the region to hold fundraisers and campaign events, he has eschewed fundraising there, and has visited just three times--most recently last summer.In August, Mr. Sanders visited Oakland, Calif., to accept the endorsement of the National Nurses United union. A super PAC run by that union has since spent nearly $1 million on ads on his behalf.Mr. Sanders's Silicon Valley money came largely from smaller donations, not maximum contributions from the companies' top brass. Fewer than 150 donors gave the maximum $2,700 for the primary to Mr. Sanders in the last quarter of 2015.Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said he wasn't surprised at Silicon Valley's support for the senator. He said the area has long been one of the places most engaged with Mr. Sanders online, even before his presidential campaign.He added that Mr. Sanders's message about income inequality is particularly resonant in San Francisco, where tensions have intensified between the city's wealthier tech community and its poorer residents. ""That's something that people there are very well aware of,"" he said. ""It makes sense that it would be part of the reason that people are drawn to Bernie's message.""To be sure, Mrs. Clinton also has the backing of a super PAC that has raised additional funds from Silicon Valley, while Mr. Sanders doesn't have an allied independent group. A group called Progressive Women Silicon Valley, which bills itself as dedicated to ""women's causes,"" donated $835,000 to her super PAC, Priorities USA Action, in the second half of the year--though its website doesn't feature Mrs. Clinton among the list of candidates the group is supporting.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 news.* New Hampshire Primary -- Live Coverage* Tiny Dixville Casts Midnight Ballots* N.H.

Last year, a community of coders who call themselves Coders for Sanders began collaborating to develop new tools to boost his campaign , and volunteer developers donated an estimated 800 hours to create an app that tracked those canvassing on the senator's behalf.For Mr. Sanders's supporters in Silicon Valley, part of the draw is that some of their own make up the campaign's top staff. Kenneth Pennington, a 24-year-old former aide in Mr. Sanders's Senate office, is the campaign's digital director. Its director of technology is 23-year-old Zach Schneider, who began aiding the campaign as a volunteer for Coders for Sanders.Volunteer coders regularly engage with the campaign through a chat channel on the instant messaging service Slack. Working together, the coders have created a slew of apps for the campaign, including a map that features all volunteer events, a phone-banking tool and a ""caucus-night counter"" the campaign used in Iowa last week that allowed precinct captains to report back to headquarters.Arman Dezfuli-Arjomandi, the co-founder of an online property management startup called OneRent.co in San Jose, first began learning about Mr. Sanders on the popular website Reddit, where he found Coders for Sanders. He subsequently created the site Bernrate.com, which tracks the senator's online popularity. The website urges viewers to donate to the Sanders campaign and to spread the word on Reddit and elsewhere.""He is just incredibly consistent,"" said Mr. Dezfuli-Arjomandi, 23. ""If you look back, his views are just the same as they were 30 years ago.""It's not just Silicon Valley's youth turning out for Mr. Sanders. Kacey Carpenter, 53, who works in high-tech marketing and lives in Mountain View, Calif., runs the NorCal for Bernie Sanders Facebook page.In December, he traveled to Reno, Nev., to hear the senator speak. ""Every word he said, I thought, 'Yes,' "" he said.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus and Alejandro Lazo",2/15/16
Young Bernistas Blighting Their Own Future; The hidden cost to all those youngsters clamoring to hear Santa Bernie lies in the future loss of jobs and the resultant loss of--or reduction in--future income.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765406802?accountid=12768,"The young, enthused by the Sanders-as-Santa sales pitch, aren't sufficiently educated to know socialism's cost to them (""Democrats' Shift Left Aids Sanders ,"" page one, Feb. 8). Socialism isn't about solving underlying problems and making the necessities of life more affordable. Rather, socialism treats the symptoms of society's economic ills by addressing who will pay for those high costs. Thus, ""tax the rich"" and ""tax the corporations"" are the progressive politician's answers to how to pay for free college, but the progressive never proposes a solution to the problem of the excessive cost of a college education.The hidden cost to all those youngsters clamoring to hear Santa Bernie lies in the future loss of jobs and job opportunities for them and the resultant loss of--or reduction in--future income and wealth accumulation when the so-called rich and corporations take their proverbial ball and go play elsewhere.Eventually, a chasm erupts within a once-cohesive country. This is what's happening all throughout Europe. Even during periods of global economic growth, socialist countries experience slower GDP growth and higher unemployment rates than the U.S. Who does this hurt? Not the rich.Andrew GlicklerPlano, TexasSocialism is the reason behind the very slow recovery from our last recession. Dodd-Frank, ObamaCare and increases in minimum wage are actually hindering our recovery and preventing creation of new, higher-paying jobs. The socialist experiment has been tried and failed miserably so many times that one would think people would learn. However, I am afraid Americans will have to experience for themselves the total ruin that socialism brings before they will move on. I have already experienced this in 1980s Poland and don't care to repeat it again.Anna HowlandSt. Johns, Fla.Bernie Sanders is writing an exciting new chapter in America's political history by energizing voters, not all of whom are young and inexperienced, with a bold and boldly expressed progressive platform. Mr. Sanders's view of the American crucible is dark, the chiaroscuro of his political palette relying exclusively on the light of progressive solutions to balance the shadows of his pessimism. I haven't witnessed such enthusiasm since the heady days of Eugene McCarthy and the challenge he mounted to a sitting president of his own party who was prosecuting the Vietnam War.Mr. Sanders appeals for our support by absolving us personally for any disappointments we have suffered. We aren't to blame. It isn't you, it isn't me, it is that wealthy guy behind the tree. Let's have confiscatory marginal income-tax rates and add new taxes, and let's use the labor of the wealthy to lessen our burdens. What do we do when the money we tax away runs out?

What Would Happen if Bernie Sanders Taxed Wall Street? The idea of a financial-transaction tax has been around for years,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764862901?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders wants to raise a lot of money from Wall Street.Mr. Sanders's plan isn't to ask Wall Street for money. It's to demand it in the form of a financial-transaction tax.Proponents claim the tax would collect tens of billions of dollars, discourage speculative and high-frequency trading, and make markets safer and less volatile. Its opponents say the revenue estimates are overstated and the tax will actually make markets more volatile.Mr. Sanders wants to use funds raised by this tax to pay for his college-education agenda, which includes making public colleges free, cutting interest rates on student loans and increasing financial aid. The costs of these proposals--$75 billion per year by Mr. Sanders's count--could be fully paid by the tax, according to Mr. Sanders.Under a bill Mr. Sanders introduced last May, investors would be required to pay an excise tax on any transfer of a stock, bond, partnership interest or derivative. Stock trades would incur a 0.5% tax rate, or $5 for every $1000 of stocks traded. Bond trading gets a 0.10% tax rate. Derivatives a 0.005% tax rate.Although those tax rates seem quite small, in theory they could raise quite a lot of revenue for the government because of the size of U.S. financial markets. The total dollar value of U.S. stocks is around $25 trillion and more than $300 billion in shares is traded on a typical day. The bond market is even bigger, with nearly $730 billion trading on an average day last year.The idea of taxing financial transactions didn't originate with Mr. Sanders. It is often called a ""Robin Hood Tax"" or a ""TobinTax,"" after Nobel laureate James Tobin, who proposed a tax on currency trading back in the 1970s. Unlike Mr. Sanders's proposal, Mr. Tobin's tax wasn't primarily aimed at raising revenue. Rather, the point was to discourage speculation that Mr. Tobin said was destabilizing foreign-exchange markets.Similar taxes have been advocated by many prominent economists over the years, including John Maynard Keynes, Joseph Stiglitz and Lawrence Summers. At least 40 countries currently or previously have had financial-transaction taxes of one sort or another.The U.S. imposed a small tax on stock transactions beginning in 1914, to help raise funds to fight World War I. Initially the tax was set at 0.02% but later ranged between 0.04% and 0.06% until its repeal in 1966. New York State and New York City jointly had a tax on stock trades until 1981. In fact, New York State still collects a stock transfer tax--and then refunds the money collected to the investors that paid it. So investors are, in effect, giving Albany an interest-free loan.The New York tax was the subject of a study by Bank of Canada economist Anna Pomeranets and Rutgers University economics professor Daniel Weaver. They found that the tax made stocks more volatile, depressed stock prices, widened bid-ask spreads and made capital more expensive for businesses. For example, when the tax was raised 25% in 1966, bid-ask spreads widened from 1.76% to 2.05%.The majority of the academic research into transaction taxes has reached similar findings: Taxes either have no effect on volatility or they increase volatility.Why would markets become more volatile when financial transactions are taxed? When an activity is taxed, people tend to do less of it. So trading volumes decline--sometimes sharply. An IMF study found that trading volume invariably fell when transaction taxes were imposed.According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a 0.01% tax would reduce volume by 24% in the first year, with volume falling even further in the future. Much of that reduction would likely come from discouraging high-frequency trading and ""unproductive"" speculation, according to the Tax Policy Center.What would a tax do to stock and bond prices? It's impossible to know for sure, of course. But because investors value liquidity, anything that makes buying or selling more costly tends to push prices down. When Sweden put in place a 1% tax on equity trades in 1983, the result was a 5.3% decline on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.According to the IMF study, the impact on prices would depend on the average holding period for a particular asset class. So stocks that trade frequently would likely decline the most. Less frequently traded securities, like corporate bonds, would be expected to hold up better.The economy, too, could suffer. When the European Commission looked at the issue, it found that a tax of 0.1% would reduce gross domestic product by 1.76% in the long run. That's mainly because the tax raises the cost of capital, resulting in less investment and diminished economic output.There are also questions about how much revenue the tax would raise. For starters, anything that makes stock prices drop sharply reduces how much the government collects in capital-gains taxes.When the Joint Committee on Taxation looked at an earlier proposal for a financial-transaction tax, it estimated that around $35 billion a year would be collected. The Tax Policy Center estimates the maximum that could be collected would be $50 billion a year.Even investors who don't trade often and primarily own mutual funds would feel the pinch. Because mutual funds must buy and sell securities to adjust their portfolios and obtain cash for investor redemptions, they would often incur the tax. According to the industry-sponsored Investment Company Institute, a transaction tax would potentially increase the expense of investing in an equity index fund by one-third.On the other hand, if the tax discouraged individual investors from trading too frequently--an all-too-common mistake--it might actually improve their returns over the long run.The tax promises a smaller, slower market offering lower returns to investors. For some voters, however, that might be the goal.Write to John Carney at john.carney@wsj.comCredit: By John Carney",2/16/16

"Bernie and the 'Lunatic of One Idea'; The dangers of monomania, from Freud's belief that sex ran everything to Sanders's 'Wall Street' obsession.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765453613?accountid=12768,"In his poem ""Esthétique du Mal,"" Wallace Stevens refers, in a memorable and useful phrase, to a ""lunatic of one idea."" The phrase refuses to leave my mind whenever I hear Bernie Sanders--and I have heard quite a lot of him in past weeks--campaigning or debating or making, most recently, victory speeches. Mr. Sanders's one idea is what he takes to be the stark economic injustice of too few people having too much money, and through the power of their money having tilted American life in a way that is vastly unfair, unjust, flat-out morally wrong. He has repeated this one idea so often, and with such ardor in its expression, as to make Johnny One-Note look like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Mr. Sanders's synecdoche for his idea is Wall Street. Everything wrong with American life can be charged up, in his telling, to a small neighborhood in lower Manhattan. Something old-fashioned there is about blaming Wall Street for all the country's deficiencies. But, then, lunatics of one idea, basking in the pleasure of Manichaeism, like to focus all their enmity on one target.For the old American Communist Party this enemy was ""the bosses."" But a street with a symbolic name is even better. Wall Street was viewed as villainous long before Mr. Sanders. For a span it was replaced by Madison Avenue, understood as a hive of hucksters inflaming our desires for things we didn't need. Bernie Sanders has now brought back Wall Street, with as he claims its big-money ability to rig elections and hence destroy all possibility of the good society that socialism, left to its own inner devices, would surely achieve. One idea, and one idea only; it isn't that complicated.Lunatics of one idea have been immensely influential, though it is far from certain that this influence has been beneficial. Think of Karl Marx, whose one idea--not so far removed from Mr. Sanders's--was the class struggle. This is an idea that ended in the formation of the Soviet Union and seven decades of pointless suppression, suffering and murder on a scale never before known.Think of Sigmund Freud, whose one idea was that sex is at the absolute center of human existence, eclipsing all else in its importance for the development of human character. This is an idea that has skewed thinking about human nature for more than a century, and, even though Freud's thought is now no longer assigned intellectual respectability, the hangover from it continues nonetheless to influence Western culture. One idea--that's all that it takes.Being a one-idea lunatic makes life a lot simpler. For one thing, it permits one to eliminate any interfering complexity from the intrusion of other or contradictory ideas, not to mention common sense. The one idea--class struggle, sexual determinism, evil Wall Street, vile Madison Avenue--becomes talismanic. Merely utter the words in which the idea is encased and all becomes plain: inner meaning, outward significance, morality, plan of action. That the one idea may not comport with reality is beside the point. As the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset said, create a concept and reality leaves the room. But let that pass.More interesting than Bernie Sanders's threadbare idea is how it has caught on with the young. In generous readings, is it their idealism that puts the young on his side? Is it his relentless moralizing that attracts them? Mr. Sanders is, as they say in social psychology, a contrast gainer--next to Hillary Clinton, with all her cumbersome political baggage (all of it Louis Vuitton, of course), he looks good. Yet when he utters his mantra at large gatherings, ""Are you ready for a political revolution?"" one wonders: Does this generation that has grown up with a greater sense of entitlement and protection than any other in history really want the revolution Mr. Sanders is selling? Can they have so little sense of the past not to know that the promise of socialism--""democratic socialism,"" the senator would interject here--has ended up in gulags and brutal cultural upheaval?Perhaps the appeal of Bernie Sanders for the young goes no further than the simplicity of his one idea. The nice thing about being a one-idea man or woman is that through it one can dismiss the complications of politics as a business of deals, compromises, limited expectations and partial gains. Why bog down in the grubby details of political life, when you can ride a single idea all the way home to utopia. As Bernie himself says, the middle class has for too long supported Wall Street; now it's time for Wall Street to support the middle class. If you believe that, or believe that it is going to happen, you qualify, prima facie, as a one-idea lunatic of your own. May you live and be well, as the Jews used to say about the czar, but not too close to me.Mr. Epstein's books include ""Masters of the Games: Essays and Stories on Sport"" (Rowman & Littlefield, 2015).Credit: By Joseph Epstein",2/17/16
"The Carolina Pander for Black Votes; Clinton and Sanders fight to own the Obama legacy, though it hasn't improved most black lives.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764795702?accountid=12768,"South Carolina is ground zero for the complicated, often ugly and visceral, racial politics that creep their way into presidential campaigns every four years.In 2000 Republican dirty tricksters used push polling to spread a false rumor that Sen. John McCain had fathered an illegitimate black child. That same year Mr. McCain called the Confederate flag a ""symbol of heritage,"" saying it should be up to South Carolinians whether to display it on their statehouse grounds. He later apologized, admitting that he had compromised his principles in an effort to win the state's primary.In 2008, after Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the Palmetto State, Bill Clinton seemed to suggest that it was only because of race: ""Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in '84 and '88."" Several weeks later Geraldine Ferraro, who backed Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, raised eyebrows. ""If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position,"" she told a reporter. ""He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.""This year's South Carolina primary promises to be the canary in the coal mine for Democrats: Can Hillary hold black voters? Can Bernie steal them away? Mr. Sanders essentially tied Mrs. Clinton in Iowa, where 91% of Democratic caucusgoers were white . He then badly beat her in New Hampshire, where 93% of Democratic primary voters were white . Now South Carolina's black voters--who made up more than half of turnout in the party's 2008 primary--are all that stands between Mrs. Clinton and a campaign free fall.So we are seeing black politicians, intellectuals, activists and media figures practically tripping over themselves to tell black voters how to use this moment of political leverage. The rush of endorsements from the black elite has inevitably led to charges that the candidates are pandering to black Americans. It has also led to a tussle over the mantle of the nation's top black politician, President Obama.Last Thursday's debate between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders turned into an argument over who is closer to the president. To a political pragmatist this is perplexing. Black America has not done very well under President Obama by key measures: persistently high unemployment, high poverty rates, eroding income for the middle class.For the past seven years Mr. Obama has appeared fearful of focusing policies on helping black Americans, out of concern that his critics might reduce him to ""the black president"" instead of the president of all Americans. Despite this intentional negligence, Mr. Obama retains a 90% approval rating among black Americans, almost solely because he is the iconic first black president.Given the intense attacks from his political opponents in Congress, Mr. Obama's excuse is understandable. Nonetheless, it has left black Americans without the help they hoped for when they gave him their votes in 2008 and 2012. So why are Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders battling to claim that they are inheriting President Obama's policy agenda? It has not delivered for black America--and Bernie and Hillary can't claim their race as an excuse for inaction.Mrs. Clinton, as the president's former secretary of state, appears to be the natural choice for Mr. Obama to embrace. That has opened the door to the president's black critics, who see in Mr. Sanders an opportunity to condemn both Hillary and the president. Here is where the discourse on race by black liberal elites goes through the looking glass into some tragic, nasty and counterproductive territory.Prof. Cornel West, who had previously called Mr. Obama the first ""niggerized"" president and ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy,"" has endorsed Mr. Sanders and introduced him at rallies in South Carolina. ""I love Brother Bernie,"" Mr. West said last year. ""He tells the truth about Wall Street. He really does."" About Mrs. Clinton, he said earlier this year that ""the word integrity is not the first thing that comes to mind.""Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, the foremost advocate of paying blacks for the wrongs of slavery, made waves on the far left this week by announcing that he will vote for Mr. Sanders. This despite the candidate's opposition to reparations, which Mr. Coates condemned last month: ""Unfortunately, Sanders's radicalism has failed in the ancient fight against white supremacy,"" he wrote at the Atlantic. ""This is the 'class first' approach, originating in the myth that racism and socialism are necessarily incompatible.""Mr. Coates makes the mistake of straying far from political reality. It is the same error committed by the Black Lives Matter protesters, who have disrupted Democratic primary events and even demanded that Mrs. Clinton apologize for the nation's history of racism.Yes, the effects of slavery and racial discrimination are still evident in the black community today. But talk of reparations and who is responsible for systemic racism is, at best, an abstraction. Alarmingly, there has been little debate about what actually would help the black community. Protesters are more interested in pie-in-the-sky proposals.Last summer Mr. Sanders surrendered the microphone when angry young black activists rushed him onstage in Seattle. He immediately began to feature talk about racial injustice in his stump speeches. Lately he has been reminding black voters of his history as an organizer with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and how he marched on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. Those efforts fell flat this week when Rep. John Lewis, who led the SNCC and marched with Dr. King, played down Mr. Sanders's involvement by saying, ""I never saw him. I never met him.""For her part, Mrs. Clinton has gone miles from her most honest moment in dealing with the black activists who lack any agenda or understanding of how to produce economic and social progress in black America. It came in a defiant stand last summer, when she was pressed to admit the role she and her husband had played in perpetuating what the activists see as systemic racism in America.""You can get lip service from as many white people as you can pack into Yankee Stadium and a million more like it who are going to say, 'We get it, we get it. We are going to be nicer,' "" Mrs. Clinton replied. ""That's not enough, at least in my book.""Yet now Mrs. Clinton is back in posturing mode, as Mr. Sanders draws closer in the polls. She is speaking loudly about black children being poisoned by contaminated drinking water in Flint. She has been campaigning with the mothers of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, all killed in high-profile confrontations. The use of lethal force by police against young black men was arguably the impetus for the Black Lives Matter movement. With this emotionally charged tactic, Mrs. Clinton, a grandmother herself, is trying to consolidate her support in the African-American community, in South Carolina and nationally.Meanwhile, the poverty rate for blacks in South Carolina is 28%, tied for the 12th highest in the nation, according to an analysis of Census Bureau figures by the Kaiser Family Foundation. How exactly does posturing and bickering among black elites or this academic discussion about reparations--a total political nonstarter--help poor black families in Charleston and Columbia? It doesn't.Only realistic, practicable solutions will help black families realize the American dream. Some ideas, like expanding school choice, demilitarizing the police and putting a renewed emphasis on personal responsibility, will appeal to conservatives. Others, like raising the minimum wage, investing in social-welfare programs and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, will appeal to liberals.It's no accident that all of this racially charged political venom is oozing out ahead of the Democratic contest in South Carolina. For seven years, discussion of concrete steps to create more economic and educational opportunity for black Americans was put on hold. The ""fierce urgency of now,"" to quote Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., is leading the competition for the black vote because so many problems, from family breakdown to the dropout rate, have been unattended.The real question is whether the politicians will still pay attention once the voting is done.Mr. Williams, a political analyst for Fox News and columnist for the Hill, is the author of ""We the People: The Modern-Day Figures Who Have Reshaped and Affirmed the Founding Fathers' Vision of America,"" forthcoming from Crown in April.Credit: By Juan Williams",2/17/16
"Bernie Blocks the FDA--and Shows the Folly of Single Payer; Senators are holding up a qualified nominee, the same way they would micromanage doctors under government health care.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764795298?accountid=12768,"By advocating ""Medicare for all,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders has rekindled the progressive dream of government-run health care. Yet Washington can't even manage the health bureaucracy it already controls. Take a look at the sad circus surrounding the doctor nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration--a qualified man whose confirmation is being blocked for political reasons.Last September the White House nominated Robert Califf, an FDA deputy commissioner since early 2015. Previously a heart specialist at Duke University's prestigious medical school, Dr. Califf has directed many clinical trials of drugs under evaluation for FDA approval. He has also sat on several FDA advisory committees. It is difficult to imagine a better candidate to lead the FDA through the serious reforms it desperately needs.Yet politics have prevailed over common sense. Dr. Califf's confirmation is being blocked by a ""hold,"" a procedural maneuver that allows a single senator to prevent his colleagues from considering a nomination. Who has put a hold on Dr. Califf? None other than Bernie Sanders.""Dr. Califf's extensive ties to the pharmaceutical industry give me no reason to believe that he would make the FDA work for ordinary Americans, rather than just the CEOs of pharmaceutical companies,"" Sen. Sanders said last month in a statement. ""We need someone who will work to substantially lower drug prices, implement rules to safely import brand-name drugs from Canada and hold companies accountable who defraud our government.""These allegations are misleading. The FDA's statutory mandate is to review clinical trials submitted by manufacturers and approve drugs for use based on their therapeutic effectiveness and safety. The commissioner has no authority to regulate drug prices. Nor can he, by administrative fiat, alter the laws governing the importation of drugs from abroad.Even if the commissioner had such powers, using them would be a huge mistake. Developing new drugs is tremendously difficult and risky. Since 1950, the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars of research has fallen 80-fold, halving about every nine years, according to a 2012 study in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. The profound complexity of biology ensures that only about one of every 10 drugs in development will eventually gain approval.Imposing price controls in the U.S.--or allowing importation of cheap drugs from Canada, which controls prices--would greatly decrease the return that manufacturers receive for undertaking risky drug development. Many would scale back new research. Pharmaceutical innovation would slow to a crawl.That said, an FDA commissioner like Dr. Califf could help patients in real ways, contrary to Sen. Sanders's aspersions. A commissioner with experience in the industry and clinical research could streamline the process and expedite the approval of lifesaving drugs. He would also be equipped to uncover and redress any questionable industry practices.Even the editors of the New England Journal of Medicine, hardly friends of the pharmaceutical industry, have urged the Senate to confirm Dr. Califf ""as quickly as possible."" Their extensive investigation of his published studies from industry-sponsored drug trials found no evidence of favoritism. Given his record, the editors wrote, ""it is impossible to argue that Califf has a pro-industry bias.""Sen. Sanders isn't alone in blocking Dr. Califf. Sen. Edward Markey (D, Mass.) has also placed a hold on the nomination. Citing widespread opioid addiction, Mr. Markey demands that the FDA reconsider its 2015 guidelines on the pediatric use of prescription opioids. Abuse of opioids is indeed serious. But Sen. Markey's maneuver is pure grandstanding: Pediatricians have always been able to prescribe opioids for their patients. All the FDA did was establish recommendations for how to administer OxyContin to teenage patients suffering from severe, otherwise untreatable pain.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) says she will hold Dr. Califf's nomination until the FDA agrees to require labeling for genetically modified salmon. She is pandering to her home state's fishing industry.This mess provides a window into what a completely government-run health-care system would look like. Politicians would have license to micromanage the drugs and services that physicians provide and patients receive. The popular passions of the day would trump science. That isn't a future anyone should fight for.Dr. Zinberg is a practicing surgeon and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

"Sanders's Record, Filings Show Benefits From Super PACs, Links to Wall Street Donors; Super PAC that gets money from nation's largest nurses' union contributed $1.5 million to campaign",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764749961?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--In nearly every speech, Bernie Sanders reminds voters that he doesn't have a super PAC, doesn't want money from Wall Street and rejects establishment politics.Yet the Vermont senator has benefited from at least $1.5 million in backing from super PACs and from political groups that don't have to fully disclose their donors, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.As a member of Congress, he regularly attended retreats with Wall Street lobbyists and other donors, and as a candidate for the Senate, he benefited from money that indirectly came from them. Last year, he directly accepted about $55,000 in Wall Street contributions for his Democratic presidential campaign, FEC filings show.To be sure, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton has raised far more from Wall Street donors, taking in $2.9 million last year, and the super PACs helping her collected $14.3 million from financial firms, about 30% of their total haul, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. She has helped raise money for her primary super PAC, while Mr. Sanders hasn't raised funds for outside groups. Overall, Mrs. Clinton raised $112 million last year, compared with $75 million raised by Mr. Sanders.Mrs. Clinton says outside contributions supporting her campaign don't influence her judgment. Mr. Sanders says that, for him, such contributions don't exist. ""I'm the only candidate up here...who has no super PAC,"" he said Thursday during a Democratic debate.He may not have formed one of his own, but Mr. Sanders is getting help from National Nurses United for Patient Protection, a super PAC that gets its money from the nation's largest nurses' union, with nearly 185,000 members.The union doesn't have to disclose its donors, but a spokesman said the super PAC money comes exclusively from members' dues. Representatives from the union have frequently joined the senator at events and this week launched a bus tour across South Carolina ahead of the state's Feb. 27 primary. At an Iowa campaign stop, Mr. Sanders thanked the group for being ""one of the sponsors"" of his campaign.In a five-minute video posted online by the nurses union in October, Mr. Sanders said he was ""honored"" to have the union's support and highlighted his work on its members' behalf. He promised to make it a ""national priority"" to focus on issues important to the union, including training more nurses. A spokesman for the union said the video was screened at its October convention.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said labor unions have long worked for candidates, and that this one is working to ensure health care for all. ""You're talking about nurses, nurses, one of the most trusted professions in the country,"" he said, ""versus millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street.""But Mrs. Clinton's supporters also can point to labor support for her super PAC. At least $7 million given to Priorities USA Action came from labor unions, including $1 million last year from the American Federation of Teachers.The battle over the influence of special interests began in earnest in New Hampshire. Mr. Sanders has been suggesting that Mrs. Clinton is influenced by Wall Street campaign donations. On Monday, she replied by drawing attention to Mr. Sanders's 2006 race for the Senate, when he benefited from $200,000 in contributions from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, known as the DSCC, which is charged with electing Democrats--and accepts significant contributions from Wall Street interests.""Sen. Sanders took $200,000 from Wall Street firms, not directly but through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee,"" she told a rally in Manchester. ""You know, there was nothing wrong with that. It hasn't changed his view. Well, it didn't change my view or my vote, either.""Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver responded by pointing to much larger Wall Street contributions benefiting Mrs. Clinton. He said the money from the DSCC comes from many places including individuals, labor and environmental groups. ""To say that every nickel that Bernie received came from Wall Street is beyond preposterous,"" Mr. Weaver said.Five of the top 20 givers to the DSCC in the 2006 election cycle were Wall Street firms, two were law firms and the rest were senators' political committees. The top giver that year was Mrs. Clinton's campaign committee, which gave $2 million. Goldman Sachs Group gave $685,050.Mr. Sanders has also regularly attended the DSCC's retreats, either during the winter in Florida or during summer on Martha's Vineyard, including one as recently as July. Guests at the retreats are donors who have donated the maximum amount to the party, or raised more than $100,000. Many attendees are lobbyists, lawyers and members of the financial industry.Similarly, at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Sanders attended a luncheon with a group of roughly 30 senators and donors who had given the maximum to the DSCC for five years in a row, or a total of $500,000. The group was called the ""Legacy Circle,"" had been organized by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, with the goal of enticing more donors to pass that threshold.Several donors who have attended the retreats said Mr. Sanders fully participated in the events, including socializing, and didn't take the opportunity to tell Wall Street lobbyists that, as he says on the stump, their industry's business model is fraud.""He was just like any other senator hobnobbing with lawyers and lobbyists from DC,"" said Rebecca Geller, a Washington attorney who attended with her husband, a financial services lobbyist. Ms. Geller, who has donated to Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said Mr. Sanders was happy to take photos with her family. ""My kids have fond memories of him hanging out by the hot tub.""Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler And Rebecca Ballhaus",2/17/16
Democrats' 2016 Candidates Jostle for Black Vote; Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigns try to secure a key constituency,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765719121?accountid=12768,"CHARLESTON, S.C.--Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders are locked in an intense competition for African-American voters, among the most reliable in the Democratic Party.Their presidential primary campaigns are canvassing black neighborhoods and aligning themselves with marquee names in the community.Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden, who is mulling a late entry into the race, has begun making quiet overtures to black leaders, including a Saturday appearance at a prayer breakfast hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus.Mr. Biden posed for photos, shook hands and was called a ""longtime Congressional Black Caucus friend"" by the caucus chairman, Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D., N.C.). The audience gave Mr. Biden a standing ovation.In 2016, black voters are expected to account for about one-fifth of the Democratic primary electorate, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling analysis. Their support is particularly important in South Carolina, an early primary state where blacks account for about half of the Democratic primary electorate.Related* Ben Carson: A Muslim Shouldn't Be PresidentMrs. Clinton's numbers are dropping in Iowa and New Hampshire, leading some to suggest that she may need South Carolina to reboot her campaign. Polls show her with a commanding lead among black voters overall.Mrs. Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state, sat at a front-row table at the black caucus foundation's awards dinner Saturday night. She smiled as the keynote speaker, President Barack Obama, singled her out with a quip about how she could surely sympathize with first lady Michelle Obama's lament to him: ""How come you get paid and I don't?""Earlier in the day, Mrs. Clinton hosted a private reception for members of the black caucus, which includes 46 lawmakers.But the prospect of Mr. Biden's jumping into the race could scramble the equation. He has spent years building relationships in South Carolina, and people close to the vice president say they view the state as a winnable primary.""He does have strong ties to South Carolina,"" said Rep. James Clyburn, the state's only Democratic lawmaker in Washington and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress. Yet, if Mrs. Clinton performs well in Iowa and New Hampshire, ""there will be no pathway to victory in South Carolina for Joe,"" Mr. Clyburn added.Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, has a tougher hurdle than Mrs. Clinton, by his own admission. Coming from a largely white state, he has little name recognition in black precincts. He has enlisted the prominent academic Cornel West as an ambassador of sorts in the black community--a move that has proved to be double-edged. Mr. West has alienated some black leaders with his pointed criticism of Mr. Obama.""What black Americans can't deny, even if they disagree with Brother West, is that Negro is a fighter for justice!"" Mr. West said, in a reference to himself. ""And that's the authority I have to bring to Bernie Sanders.""Mrs. Clinton's campaign opened offices in South Carolina last spring and spent the summer holding hundreds of grass roots events and one-on-one meetings with voters. Her team already has contacted nearly 100,000 Democrats in the state, activated a few thousand volunteers and secured endorsements from dozens of elected officials.In the 2008 primary, black voters lined up behind Mr. Obama, who easily defeated Mrs. Clinton in South Carolina, 55% to 27%. With Mr. Obama not on the ballot, Clinton supporters are hoping she can tap into black voters' strong affinity for her husband.Some say, though, that she will need to overcome residual anger over Bill Clinton's comments in 2008 suggesting that Mr. Obama's win in South Carolina was as inconsequential as Jesse Jackson's victory in the 1984 primary.Mr. Sanders didn't make his first campaign visit to South Carolina until late August, and he opened up his first two campaign offices in the state in the past month. Christopher Covert, Mr. Sanders's state director in South Carolina, said the campaign is working to build relationships with voters, adding that the more people learn about the senator's message, the more they like him.""We were always planning on playing here,"" Mr. Covert said. ""The question was what was the right time?""On Saturday, volunteers and staffers for the Sanders campaign fanned out across the West Ashley section of Charleston to knock on doors. Their first task often was to explain who, exactly, Mr. Sanders is; many voters in this neighborhood said they had never heard of him.As volunteers Cherri Delesline and Loreen Myerson wrapped up one pitch, it became apparent that the politics of the 2016 presidential race are hard to predict.

Democratic Economists Say Bernie Sanders's Math Doesn't Add Up; Economists say candidate's proposals risk undercutting Democrats' reputation as 'party of responsible arithmetic',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765700590?accountid=12768,"Four leading Democratic economists sharply criticized Sen. Bernie Sanders for citing ""extreme claims"" about the economic effects of his campaign proposals, the latest in a stream of critiques from Democrats over details of his platform.Criticism has also been directed at Mr. Sanders's plan for a single-payer, government-run health-care plan , with critics saying he underestimates the costs of providing health care to all Americans and overestimates the revenue his plan would generate.The dispute reflects a broader debate under way inside the Democratic Party, as many liberals line up behind the presidential campaign of Mr. Sanders and his proposals for significant new government spending to fill unmet needs, while others back his rival former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who describes her plans as far more realistic.On Wednesday, the four economists took aim at Gerald Friedman, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, who has said that the Sanders economic program could boost growth in gross domestic product to 5.3% annually, up from 2.4% in each of the past two years.""As much as we wish it were so, no credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes,"" said the economists in an open letter . Three of them were directors for President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers--Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago, Alan Krueger of Princeton and Christina Romer of the University of California at Berkeley; and one of them, Laura D'Andrea Tyson of Berkeley, was director for President Bill Clinton.Mr. Friedman said in an interview that his projections rely on assumptions used by the respected Congressional Budget Office, and that the influx of spending, particularly for infrastructure and college, under Mr. Sanders's plan would amount to a giant stimulus program. ""There's nothing at all unusual in my method,"" he said. ""Why can't the economy grow faster?""The economist critics argue that overly rosy projections risk undercutting the Democrats' reputation as ""the party of responsible arithmetic,"" and said such statements undercut the party's ability to critique Republicans. Mr. Goolsbee said he was supporting Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Krueger said he hasn't endorsed a candidate; neither are formally involved with either campaign.Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate, wrote on his blog at the New York Times that the letter was important. ""Sanders needs to disassociate himself from this kind of fantasy economics right now,"" he wrote.Others said the letter made too much of one piece of analysis written by an economist who isn't working for the Sanders campaign. ""An economist not affiliated with the campaign released an implausibly optimistic analysis. Why does that besmirch Democrats? It just seems like an overreaction,"" said Jared Bernstein, who served as an economist in the Obama administration and hasn't endorsed any candidate.The Sanders health plan has come in for particular criticism from the economists who signed the letter, and from others. Relying on an analysis from Mr. Friedman, the Sanders campaign says the vast majority of Americans would come out ahead under his health plan, which would replace private insurance companies and the web of government programs with one government-run system.Kenneth Thorpe, a well-known health economist at Emory University, said the Sanders health plan would actually require some $24 trillion in new federal spending over 10 years, significantly more than the $13.8 trillion estimated by the campaign.He said Mr. Sanders is vastly overstating the savings that national health care will generate, projecting unrealistic reductions in spending on prescription drugs and administration. He said Mr. Sanders also is underestimating the increased demand for care that will come from newly insured patients and from those who are now discouraged by co-payments and deductibles, which Mr. Sanders plans to eliminate.""The magnitude of the savings they are presuming would never materialize,"" said Mr. Thorpe, who has long advised Democrats on health policy.He added that Mr. Sanders also is wrongly assuming that states will continue to contribute increasing sums of money to subsidize health costs when they are no longer responsible for their own Medicaid programs.Mr. Friedman replied that some of that critique may be legitimate, but that Mr. Thorpe is significantly understating the savings that a national health program would generate.Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's top policy adviser, offered two responses. He said that there is no reason to think that a single-payer health plan cannot succeed in the U.S., given its success in other industrialized countries. ""If every other industrialized country can do it, America will be able to do it, if there is a will,"" he said.He also questioned the motives of the critics. Mr. Thorpe, he noted, worked in the Clinton administration. He also said that the four economists support free-trade deals that Mr. Sanders opposes.""It's not surprising that some of the same establishment economists who told us how wonderful NAFTA and unfettered free trade would be are now attacking Sen. Sanders's economic agenda,"" he said.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Nick Timiraos and Laura Meckler",2/18/16
Democrats Vie for Nevada's Minorities; Clinton and Sanders seek to mobilize nonwhite voters as caucuses near,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765700446?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS--Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will face his biggest test so far in his run for the White House this week, when voters in one of the most ethnically and racially diverse states in the country will make their choice in the Democratic presidential contest on Saturday.Nevada--a sprawling Western state with important blocs of Latino, black and Asian-American voters--is the next stop for Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton. For Mr. Sanders, a win in the Silver State would be an opportunity to show he has appeal among the nonwhite voters who make up a significant part of the Democratic electorate. He has long trailed Mrs. Clinton in the polls among black and Hispanic voters. For Mrs. Clinton, a win here would be an important show of force and bolster her argument that she can put together a winning coalition in November against a Republican nominee.""We're going to get a good sense of what Latinos, African-Americans, and Asians are thinking. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are working tirelessly to reach out to these communities,"" said Ruben Kihuen, a Nevada state senator running for U.S. Congress and a supporter of Mrs. Clinton.The state is more than a quarter Latino and has a sizable black population. It also has a large Asian-American community, the fastest-growing minority group in the country. Non-Hispanic whites now represent less than half of the population of Las Vegas.The state's diversity and the increasingly close battle between the two Democratic candidates have set off a fierce fight to persuade and mobilize nonwhite voters--with surrogates crisscrossing the state on behalf of both campaigns. Two Nevada polls this month show the contest in a dead heat, though the state is traditionally difficult to survey effectively.Mrs. Clinton's campaign brought in Rep. John Lewis, a civil-rights icon and a longtime Democratic member of Congress from Georgia to help boost turnout among the black community. He made his case for Mrs. Clinton at several campaign stops this week, including at a historically black church and a community center in a low-income neighborhood. ""I'm going to continue to travel as long as there's a campaign,"" said Mr. Lewis, calling Mrs. Clinton the best-prepared candidate to be president.The Clinton campaign also has brought in Dolores Huerta, a civil-rights leader and labor activist who co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with Cesar Chavez in the 1960s. The campaign is on television in Spanish and has hosted events in Spanish aimed at familiarizing Latino voters with the complicated caucus process.Mr. Sanders's campaign has been equally aggressive, particularly in the Latino community. The campaign brought Mr. Chavez's nephew, Federico Chavez as a surrogate. The campaign is dispatching a group of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children to knock on doors across the state. The campaign is on television with an endorsement from Lucy Flores, a former state legislator running for U.S. Congress.Both candidates attended church services Sunday at a large historically black church in Las Vegas and addressed the congregation.""I am not a single-issue candidate and this is not a single-issue country,"" Mrs. Clinton said, referring to Mr. Sanders's sharp focus on Wall Street and campaign-finance issues. ""Because if we were going to achieve everything about banks and money and politics, would that end racism?""Sanders campaign state director Joan Kato said they are ceding no ground. ""We're doing outreach in all those communities,"" she said.Mrs. Clinton's campaign strategy relies on maintaining her well of support with nonwhite voters after her narrow win in Iowa and big loss in New Hampshire. Both of those states are whiter and more rural than the country at large.Still, her campaign began lowering expectations ahead of the caucuses here. ""There's an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucus in Nevada. But it's still a state that is 80% white voters,"" campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on MSNBC after New Hampshire.The comment drew a rebuke from Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who helped move the caucuses early in the process. Mr. Reid told reporters on Tuesday that he had complained to the Clinton campaign about the comment. Mrs. Clinton later rejected the comment in a television interview.Steven Horsford, a Democrat who was the first black Congressman from Nevada and former majority leader of the state senate, said the explicit racial appeals may not work among younger nonwhite voters who are looking for a more comprehensive agenda. Mr. Horsford, now a Washington, D.C., marketing consultant, was voted out of office amid a Republican wave in Nevada in 2014.""Both campaigns have more work to do to speak to a broad constituency and not put everybody in categories--all African-American voters are not the same. Increasingly you have a generational gap in what young and old voters are looking for from candidates,"" said Mr. Horsford, who hasn't endorsed a candidate.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Alexandra Berzon at alexandra.berzon@wsj.comCredit: By Byron Tau and Alexandra Berzon",2/18/16
Republicans Are Campaigning to Lose; The candidate brawls and party disunity are setting up Clinton or Sanders for a win in November.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765696410?accountid=12768,"The CNN exit poll for the New Hampshire primary asked Republican voters if they ""feel betrayed by Republican politicians?"" Forty-seven percent said yes. And that was the view of grass-roots Republicans in a state where moderates usually rule. Imagine what the percentage of Republicans who feel betrayed might be in more conservative states. We'll find out Saturday in South Carolina.The split between an aggrieved GOP base--the betrayed--and the party's leaders dominates the Republican presidential race. It has turned televised debates into brawls. And it threatens to prevent Republicans from winning the presidency that otherwise might be theirs.If the turbulence continues--and there's no end in sight--the Republican nominee will lead a badly divided and weakened party in the general election in November. The Democratic candidate won't be a powerhouse. That's a certainty. But either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders will have the benefit of a united Democratic Party, a significant advantage in a close election.The New Hampshire exit poll, by the way, asked Democrats if they feel betrayed by their politicians. Only 15% said yes, a mere fringe of discontent.Anyone who watched the two debates last week could see the difference. The Republican candidates--four of the six anyway--got caught up in personal attacks. They were testy and offended. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, while hardly chummy, spent considerable time echoing each other. ""There is no question Secretary Clinton and I are friends,"" Mr. Sanders said before noting a partial disagreement over Libya. No Republican uttered such words.Some viewers may have been stirred by the angry clashes between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and by Donald Trump's wild charges against President George W. Bush. I winced. The candidates appeared to be anything but presidential. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, for all their harping on left-wing themes, came closer to the presidential standard, at least for a night.The split between party leaders and a substantial number of party voters emerged after Republicans won the House in the 2010 midterm election, and swelled when they added the Senate in 2014. Their legislative gains were minimal. The Republican base, egged on by conservative talk radio, accused congressional leaders of knuckling under to President Obama. Thus the notion of betrayal.The discord and anger were practically an invitation to Mr. Trump to enter the race. A unified Republican Party would have provided him neither the political space in which to run nor issues to exploit. And Mr. Trump would most likely have decided not to run, as he had in earlier presidential years.The moment he announced, Mr. Trump made opposition to immigration his calling card. It was a shrewd choice. More than any other issue, immigration alienates the conservative base from the Republican establishment in Washington. The real-estate tycoon turned reality TV star went on to create a constituency that includes working-class Republicans, renegade Democrats, and moderates.Mr. Trump's crude style has had a huge impact. He insults rivals, tosses out slurs, trashes Republican icons, and interrupts constantly during debates whenever he is mentioned, alluded to, or just feels like it. When he's talking, he waves off anyone who dares to break in.Absent Mr. Trump, would other candidates have acted like students at his school of bad behavior? I don't think so. I've watched debates in presidential races going back to 1980 and never seen anything like Mr. Trump's antics. Chris Christie's near-destruction of Marco Rubio in the Feb. 2 debate was made possible by Mr. Trump's example. So was the row in last week's debate when Mr. Rubio said Mr. Cruz had lied repeatedly and Mr. Cruz said the accusation was ""knowingly false."" This occurred as they both talked at the same time, barroom style.The more bruising the fights, the more difficult it will be to produce Republican unity. The New Hampshire exit poll was not encouraging. Republican voters were asked if they would be ""satisfied if Cruz wins the nomination?"" The result: 38% said yes, 59% no. Mr. Rubio did slightly better: 41% yes, 57% no. Mr. Trump beat both of them: 51% yes, 46% no.Democrats were asked a similar question. Satisfied if Mrs. Clinton is the nominee? Sixty percent said yes, 37% no. If Mr. Sanders wins? Seventy-nine percent said they'd be satisfied, 20% said they wouldn't.Given the relative harmony of the Democratic debates, these numbers weren't surprising. Last week's debate was filled with comments like ""I completely agree with Senator Sanders"" and ""nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with."" Mrs. Clinton said she was ""in vigorous agreement"" with Mr. Sanders's zeal for taxing the rich. ""Let me concur,"" Mr. Sanders said, with Mrs. Clinton's stand on women's rights.Mr. Sanders didn't bring up Mrs. Clinton's email scandal, the Clinton Foundation, or her fees for speeches to Wall Street firms. He must have figured Democrats didn't want to hear about her personal troubles, and raising them might backfire.There was a sharp exchange or two but nothing that might jeopardize party unity or an upbeat national convention. This happens when candidates are operating off the same playbook--in their case, the progressive agenda.Having capitalized on the GOP split, Mr. Trump shows no interest in bringing the party together. Unity is not his strong suit. His put-downs of every Republican except Ronald Reagan continue nonstop. Like Mr. Cruz, he's antiestablishment. But he treats Mr. Cruz no better than the other candidates. Two days ago, he said Mr. Cruz is ""the biggest liar"" he's ever met and ""unstable.""The Donald is not a team player, yet he has the best shot at the moment of winning the nomination. What happens then? The Republican rift will not be healed and disunity will reign. It's highly likely that a sizable chunk of the Republican establishment will decline to back Mr. Trump in a repeat of 1964 when liberal and moderate Republicans refused to support Barry Goldwater.The gap separating Republicans back then was greater than today's split. But by the time the party recovered, the Great Society agenda of President Lyndon Johnson had been enacted. We still feel its effects a half-century later with more Americans dependent on government than ever.In 2016 the prospect of a Republican triumph is fading. Republicans would rather quarrel angrily than win. Should this allow Mrs. Clinton to slip into the White House, we have a pretty good idea what will happen. President Obama's legacy of ever-bigger government will be preserved, Mrs. Clinton will add to it, and America will suffer the consequences.Mr. Barnes, executive editor of the Weekly Standard, is a Fox News commentator.Credit: By Fred Barnes",2/18/16
"How Sanders, Trump Threaten Market Confidence; Populist political outsiders bring radical policy proposals and little allegiance to economic orthodoxy",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765640406?accountid=12768,"Markets don't usually pay a lot of attention to presidential elections. For all the campaign theatrics, presidents from both parties, once in office, tend to hew to economic orthodoxy, whether on free trade or the independence of the Federal Reserve.This would be a good year to jettison those assumptions.Much as the global financial crisis tripped up economists in 2008, so too has the presidential campaign made a mockery of political soothsaying.Only now are investors grappling with the possibility that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist and leader of a ""political revolution,"" or Republican Donald Trump, a reality-TV personality who devises policy on the fly, could actually be president. Either would foreshadow unprecedented uncertainty and potential upheaval in government policy.The risk lies not just in their policies, which are radical enough. Mr. Sanders would break up the big banks, introduce universal government-funded health care and raise the federal minimum wage to $15. Mr. Trump would slap steep tariffs on imports from China and Mexico and build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out immigrants.The greater risk is that both men represent a rejection of economic orthodoxy. They don't especially care that mainstream economists pan their proposals. Neither, apparently, do their growing ranks of supporters. A public whose inflation-adjusted incomes have been ratcheting downward since 1999 and overwhelmingly believes the country is on the wrong track may feel it has little to lose from unorthodox ideas.Is that so bad? Many contemporary experts thought Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan harbored dangerous ideas. In office, though, both men surrounded themselves with astute advisers and ultimately got the big questions right: John Maynard Keynes called President Roosevelt's abandonment of the gold standard ""magnificently right"" while President Reagan's support for monetary austerity to quell inflation drew the support of Milton Friedman.Thus far, there is no coherent economics evident in the policies of Mr. Trump. Asked to name an economic adviser, his campaign cites billionaire hedge-fund manager Carl Icahn. Illegal immigrants from Mexico are central villains in his narrative of American decline, though their ranks have been falling since 2007.Mr. Sanders puts more thought into his policies and has found some economists to back them. Nonetheless, his ideas are driven less by economic evidence than a deeply entrenched, ideological view of a world stacked in favor of business and the rich.The Affordable Care Act has reduced the share of the population without health insurance to the lowest in at least a generation. Yet Mr. Sanders would sweep it away with a costly and disruptive universal health plan that four former Democratic chairmen of the White House Council of Economic Advisers say ""undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic."" (Two have been outside advisers to his rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to her campaign.) He would break up big banks, which he considers irredeemably corrupt, even though onerous new regulations passed in the wake of the crisis are still taking effect.On fiscal policy, both men have redefined the boundaries of the politically palatable. Back in 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain was criticized for a tax plan that would have shrunk revenues by more than $1 trillion over 10 years, according to a nonpartisan analysis at the time. The added spending or foregone revenue of Mr. Trump's and Mr. Sanders's plans each come to more than 10 times as much, according to a different nonpartisan group, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Markets may take comfort that even if one of these men became president, their more extravagant ideas wouldn't get past Congress. That's true especially of Mr. Sanders, since at least one chamber is likely to remain Republican-controlled. But presidents exercise extraordinary influence, through the regulatory and law-enforcement apparatus, the bully pulpit and diplomacy.Andy Laperriere, an analyst at Cornerstone Macro, says a President Sanders could ""beat the tar out of"" banks, while a President Trump could start a trade war with China.Moreover, Messrs. Sanders and Trump didn't achieve their popularity in a vacuum. Many in Congress and the broader public share their populist distrust of globalization and finance. That imperils the recently signed but still not ratified 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the institution about which markets care most: the Federal Reserve. Many in Congress see it not as economists do--as the savior of the economy--but as handmaiden to the banks or an unaccountable enabler of fiscal profligacy.The Fed usually depends on the White House to protect it from congressional meddling, but in recent years it has lost legislative battles over the makeup of its board of governors and the use of its earnings. President Obama did promise to veto a Republican-backed House bill that would have subjected the Fed to invasive audits. Presumably a president Sanders, who backed a similar bill in the Senate , would have signed it.From China to oil, markets already have plenty to worry about. To that list they can now add a possible president that presides over a circumscribed central bank, escalating trade conflict or a stepped-up assault on Wall Street.Write to Greg Ip at greg.ip@wsj.comCredit: By Greg Ip",2/18/16

""If these establishment economists don't like the study they can come up with their own opinions,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton has argued that several of Mr. Sanders's policy proposals aren't politically achievable, but Wednesday's broadside from the economists rests only on their economic veracity, not the politics.The economists said in their letter that they had been similarly critical of ""fantastical claims"" by Republicans who have argued that large tax cuts for wealthier households have paid for themselves by boosting economic growth.

Ted Cruz, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds.The poll found that support for Mr. Trump dropped to 28% among likely Republican voters in South Carolina, down 8 points from January, while support for Mr. Cruz rose slightly to 23%.

Marco Rubio drew 15%; former Gov. Jeb Bush had 13%; and Gov. John Kasich and Ben Carson each had 9%.One question heading into Saturday's voting is whether the primary will establish a clear front-runner among the field's centrist, establishment-friendly candidates. But the close showings by Messrs. Rubio and Bush in the poll suggest that South Carolina voters could leave it to a future contest to winnow the field.Among Democrats, the poll showed that Hillary Clinton maintains a wide lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders, signaling that the state's primary could help stabilize her campaign after a lopsided loss in New Hampshire and a narrow win in Iowa. Democrats hold their primary in South Carolina on Feb. 27.The report of a Trump decline among South Carolina Republicans came a day after a WSJ/NBC News poll of Republican primary voters nationally found that he had lost his once-commanding lead and fallen narrowly behind Mr. Cruz . Most national polls and South Carolina surveys have been showing Mr. Trump with a double-digit lead over his rivals.The new Journal/NBC/Marist poll in South Carolina was conducted Feb. 15-17, after Mr. Trump drew attention and criticism for an especially aggressive performance during a televised debate among the GOP candidates.The poll found that the biggest change in the Republican race came from Mr. Trump losing support rather than from the other candidates making big gains. Mr. Trump's lead over Mr. Cruz declined across the board, but most notably among very conservative voters and tea party activists.Messrs. Cruz and Trump are in a close contest for support among evangelical voters, a big faction of South Carolina's GOP electorate that Mr. Cruz has been wooing assiduously. Mr. Trump is drawing 29% of evangelicals and Mr. Cruz 26%, the poll found.With so many of the second-tier candidates running neck-and-neck for third and fourth places, the primary may leave the field in a muddle.""With the race tightening, it looks like South Carolina may not be any better than Iowa and New Hampshire in clarifying the race,"" said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion.Among Democrats, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders by 60% to 32% among people likely to vote in the Democratic primary. That lead is nine points narrower than in January.Mrs. Clinton's position is anchored in a big advantage among the state's large African-American population, especially older black voters.Among African-Americans over 45, Mrs. Clinton outpolled Mr. Sanders by 78% to 12%. Among younger African-Americans, Mrs. Clinton's edge was narrower, 52% to 35%.Mr. Sanders leads Mrs. Clinton among white voters, 51% to 46%. Other voting groups that back him by large margins include voters under 45 and first-time voters.But those groups don't make up as large a voting bloc as the minority population that is favoring Mrs. Clinton.""Clinton is positioned to carry South Carolina by racking up huge numbers among African-Americans, who are expected to make up about 60% of the Democratic primary electorate,"" said Mr. Miringoff. ""Right now, the Clinton firewall is holding firm in the state.""The Journal/NBC/Marist poll surveyed 722 likely Republican voters and 425 likely Democratic voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.6 percentage points for the Republican group and plus or minus 4.8 points for Democratic results.Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.comCredit: By Janet Hook",2/19/16

""Some may have doubted us but we never doubted each other.""In her speech, she repeatedly invoked what Americans can accomplish together, rather than why she was the best choice for president, a shift in her campaign message. ""Let's do this together,"" she said. ""The future that we want is within our grasp.""Going forward, a top Clinton aide said, Mrs. Clinton would be talking more about the need for America to build a better society collectively, and on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton promised to roll out new ideas to encourage national service. ""It can't be just about what we're going to give you. It has to be about what we're going to build together,"" she said.Mr. Sanders, in conceding the loss in Nevada, made clear he's determined to fight on in the primary race. ""Taking on the establishment, whether it is the financial establishment, whether it is the political establishment, whether it is the media establishment, is not easy,"" he told his supporters.""We have come a very long way in nine months,"" he said, promising a historic political upset by the time the party gathers for its July convention in Philadelphia. ""We have the momentum.""Mrs. Clinton had long been considered the favorite in Nevada. But Mr. Sanders' 22-point victory margin in the Granite State's primary gave him a major boost, and an infusion of donations allowed him to put staff on the ground and television ads on the air.The caucuses, hosted at 250 schools, casinos and community centers around the state, determined how the state's 35 pledged delegates to the national convention will be awarded. A total of 2,383 are needed to win at this summer's Philadelphia convention, underscoring the long road ahead.Clinton supporters, packed into a ballroom at Caesars Palace hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, erupted at reports that she has been declared the winner here, with spontaneous chants of ""Hillary! Hillary!"" The Clinton party was one floor above the ballroom where a couple of hours earlier nearly 300 Las Vegas shift workers and hotel employees gathered for a caucus that gave Mrs. Clinton a solid victory.Entrance polls showed Mrs. Clinton winning among women, voters age 45 and older, Democrats and those who consider themselves politically moderate. She also won majority support among those looking for someone with the right experience, and those who cared most about someone who can win in November.""I just believe she's the right person,"" said Susan Castronova, age 50, of Henderson, Nev. ""She's got the knowledge, and she's got the experience.""Mr. Sanders continued to show strength with the heart of his coalition: younger voters, liberals and independents. He also won among those looking for a candidate who is ""honest and trustworthy"" and those who cared most that a candidate.Many voters said they had been bombarded with phone calls, emails and door knocks, particularly from the Clinton campaign.Tracy Leavitt, a 58-year-old disabled former child-care employee, said she received regular calls and visits from Clinton volunteers at her home in Pahrump, and just one call from the Sanders campaign. Still, while standing in line Saturday, she decided to back Mr. Sanders.""I like how he's in your face, saying this is what I'm going to do,"" Ms. Leavitt said. ""I want someone like him who is different.""Now the campaign shifts to the South, where Mrs. Clinton's strength with black voters puts her in a strong position to pick up a string of quick wins. South Carolina votes next Saturday, and well over half of the voters are expected to be African-American. Polls show her ahead.Then come 11 states on March 1, and both campaigns see her with an advantage in the southern states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Texas and Tennessee. The Sanders campaign sees potential victories in Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Massachusetts, as well as in his home state of Vermont.For Mrs. Clinton, strength with black voters is critical to her path to victory, and at the caucuses her support among them held strong. Entrance polls showed her winning this group by a 3-to-1 margin.Sentiment was overwhelmingly pro-Clinton at a North Las Vegas precinct in the heart of the region's African-American community. Voters there said they appreciated her long support and said they didn't know Mr. Sanders as well.Kathy Willis, 62, appeared to have absorbed a major message from the Clinton campaign: that she would continue President Barack Obama's legacy. ""You don't want to overturn the things Obama has done, especially health care,"" she said.Even with the Clinton victory, the tight race in Nevada shows how competitive the Democratic presidential contest has become.Initially, Mrs. Clinton was seen as such a strong candidate that few Democrats even considered running this year. And when he entered the race, Mr. Sanders was viewed as a message candidate who might nudge her toward more liberal positions, but who didn't stand a real chance at winning the nomination.The Clinton campaign and its backers long dismissed his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire, noting that they are two of the whitest states in the nation, and have particularly liberal voters participating in their nominating contests.But Mr. Sanders's Nevada finish, where about a third of voters were Hispanic or African-American, is a sign that his campaign is likely to remain competitive for some time.Byron Tau, Reid Epstein, Alexandra Berzon and Alejandro Lazo contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com , Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler, Colleen McCain Nelson and Peter Nicholas",2/21/16
"The Young and the Economically Clueless; Millennials are flocking to Sanders, and in the GOP they favor Trump. Why are young people voting against their own interests?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766586519?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders, the 74-year-old self-described democratic socialist, is surprising even himself with his primary-season success against Hillary Clinton, fueled by a staggering 83% majority of the under-30 vote in New Hampshire and 84% in the Iowa caucuses.As this newspaper reported on Tuesday, voters in the millennial bracket, 18- to 34-year-olds, will for the first time equal the baby-boomer share of the electorate, at 31%. These young voters appear to be falling headlong for the Vermont senator's plaintive narrative of economic ""unfairness."" His throwaway prescriptions for redistributing income and wealth are being echoed by an increasingly nervous Mrs. Clinton--despite such policies' having been jettisoned during her husband's administration in the 1990s.Then again, Republican front-runner Donald Trump's vague promises that he will ""make America great again"" aren't much more comforting--except to the masses of Americans responding to his populist diatribes against free trade and immigrants. He too scored well with the young in New Hampshire, though, winning 38% of the 18-29 support, more than double his closest competitor for that group, Ted Cruz, at 17%.These young voters seem not to realize that the economic policies they find so resonant are the least likely to promote the growth and the social mobility they desire. They deserve to be lead from the discredited backwater of equalizing outcomes, forward with policies that instead help eliminate barriers frustrating their access to opportunities.The millennials can't be faulted for being anxious about their economic prospects. They are coming of age in the weakest economy in generations. The underemployment rate (measuring those working a job for which they're overqualified and underpaid) for young adults below age 30 is 60%. The overall employment-to-population ratio of 77.4% for those in the prime-of-working-life 25-54 age bracket translates into 1.5 million jobs below the 20-year average.The college graduate living in his parents' basement and working a marginal job to service a student loan is by now an archetype of the Obama era. And while the headline unemployment numbers are down, and the administration congratulates itself on a tepid ""recovery"" that was almost exclusively dependent on Fed-engineered financial-asset inflation, there is every reason to be skeptical about the health of the labor market. The labor-participation rate languishes at its lowest level in 40 years, and credit creation, government and private investment aren't faring much better.Both Democrats and some Republicans keep blaming it all on ""Wall Street"" (Bernie Sanders's all-purpose boogeyman) for ""getting away with murder"" (Donald Trump on hedge funds). Don't they realize that the financial markets are the lubricant of the entire economy--that Wall Street's capacity to provide liquidity and to broker capital is the lifeblood of American companies? History will probably judge the misguided post-crisis regulations like Dodd-Frank and retribution against Wall Street to have sown the seeds of the next financial crisis. For now, the vilification of Wall Street in the presidential campaign is irresponsible.The sluggish growth of jobs and the economy has a lot more to do with the transitioning from American manufacturing and services to information technology than with the 2008 financial crisis and its supposed perpetrators. And the Fed alone can't do much more to promote its employment-and-inflation mandates.Why? Because the economy is facing complex structural headwinds for both: Artificial intelligence and self-learning algorithms are efficiency-creating and cost-reducing, and soon they will be displacing service professionals and Ph.Ds just as they have factory workers. The Bank of England projects that 45% of jobs done by people in the U.K. will eventually be performed by robots. ArkInvest expects the U.S. to shed 75 million jobs in the next two decades.And yes, the new tech-economy wealth is increasingly concentrating in the hands of relatively few innovators and financiers, leaving the middle class and its consumer demand lagging behind. What is the appropriate role of government in redressing this?Why wouldn't young voters want ""free stuff"" paid for by the rich, as the Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton narrative promises? Because the no-free-lunch axiom is still true: Mr. Sanders's socialized education, health care and other policies would cost up to $20 trillion, according to analysts, requiring tax collections to increase up to 47%. And have we not at least learned from the collapse and dismantling of socialism over the past quarter century that governments lack the incentives and resources to effectively allocate and manage capital in the microeconomy? The eldest of the millennials were in elementary school when the Soviet Union collapsed, so they might be forgiven for their unfamiliarity with the failure of socialist economics. But Bernie Sanders was the mayor of Burlington, Vt., and Hillary Clinton the first lady of Arkansas--what's their excuse for revanchist economics?The economic culture of the U.S. is different than that of any country in the world. Americans have always admired each other's economic success and striven for the chance to achieve it for themselves--by building, not taking the wealth from their neighbors' pockets. Donald Trump is unabashedly proud of his success--no wonder he's so popular. As a political leader, though, he needs to up his economic game quickly from ""There's going to be a bubble popping"" and ""Nobody can solve it like me.""Real solutions demand real leadership, not polarizing Twitter-length rhetoric. An America-appropriate policy response to the inequality challenge needs to be focused on equalizing opportunities, not outcomes. At the very least, removing barriers to social mobility will require tax, regulatory and educational reforms to give people the qualifications and liberty to improve their lives in the new economy.At this point in the presidential campaign, all the ideas for stimulating growth are coming from the Republican side: Marco Rubio has discussed the transformational challenges of the tech economy, and he has proposed alternatives to traditional campus-based higher education (online college and flexible vocational training); innovative student-loan programs; and corporate tax and regulatory reforms. Jeb Bush and John Kasich are also reform-minded, including promoting initiatives to ease the burden on small businesses that power job growth.Yet millennials, who would most benefit from a real economic recovery, replacing the false one of the past several years, so far seem intent on voting against their interests. There is still hope. We're moving past the peak of the ""authenticity"" phase of the campaign cycle, when voters unfamiliar with the field of candidates are initially drawn simply to candidates who seem willing to bluntly speak their minds. John Kasich's strong performance in New Hampshire might herald the transition to a more constructive phase, when voters--including millennials--are readier to listen to a more nuanced, realistic economic message. If not, today's young voters may not like the world they inherit, and members of the aging generation risk eventually finding themselves short of the Social Security benefits they thought they had coming.Mr. Arbess, the founder of Xerion Investments, is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and co-founder of No Labels, promoting political bipartisanship.Credit: By Daniel J.

Bernie Sanders's Path to Democratic Nomination Impeded by Nevada Result; Vermont senator looks forward to Super Tuesday contests on March 1 as next best chance for a victory against rival Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766825575?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS--Sen. Bernie Sanders's path ahead in the Democratic presidential primary was already challenging, and it was made more so by his defeat Saturday in the Nevada caucuses.Hillary Clinton now claims victory in two of the first three contests , and she's favored to win the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary, too. Mr. Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary, won't see his next best chance for a second victory until March 1, when 11 states host primaries and caucuses.In his remarks in Nevada, Mr. Sanders briefly noted that he's traveling to South Carolina on Sunday, but then he quickly pivoted to the next round of primaries with nearly 900 delegates up for grabs.""We're going to be competing in 11 states all across this country on Super Tuesday,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""And I believe that on Super Tuesday, we have got an excellent chance to win many of those states.""On Monday, he will go to Massachusetts and on Tuesday he goes to Virginia, both contests that will follow South Carolina.His campaign is already running paid TV ads in Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma, as well as Massachusetts, four states where advisers see their best chances for victory. Minnesota and Colorado are caucus states, which tend to attract the more liberal voters that he appeals to, his advisers said.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 news.* LIVE BLOG: The Latest From the Races in South Carolina, Nevada* Hillary Clinton Wins Nevada Democratic Caucuses* Ace Beats Six: Hillary Clinton Wins Nevada Delegate in Card Draw Tie-Breaker* In GOP Primary, South Carolina Lives Up to Mudslinging Reputation* South Carolina's Clyburn Endorses Clinton* Pope Francis and Trump Spar Over Immigration and Candidate's Faith* Critics See Racial Subtext in Obama-Rubio Photo MashupMr. Sanders also holds a huge advantage in his home state of Vermont, another March 1 state.Also voting the same day are Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Arkansas, all contests that will feature a significant number of African-American voters. That should provide an advantage to Mrs. Clinton, whose support in the black community was reaffirmed in Nevada, where entrance polls showed three-fourths of African-Americans backed her. She's expected to see similar support in South Carolina.Mr. Sanders's campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Saturday that the campaign will compete in the Palmetto State even though they know the Vermont senator is the underdog. ""We're going to go down and we're going to fight in South Carolina. It's obviously an uphill fight for us there,"" he said. ""Then we're going to go to Super Tuesday.""After that, the Sanders campaign sees potential victories on March 5 in Kansas and Nebraska and on March 6 in Maine--all three caucus states. Sanders aides are also focused on the big prize of Michigan, where a primary is set for March 8. Mr. Weaver referred to the contest there as a ""a big showdown.""Mr. Weaver also noted that under Democratic Party rules, delegates are allocated proportionately, meaning that if a race is close, both candidates win substantial delegates.There are no winner-take-all states in the Democratic primary race, which prevents one candidate from pulling far away from a competitor. At the same time, though, this system makes it very hard to catch up once a candidate falls behind.When challengers are forced to drop out, it is usually because they run out of money, and Mr. Sanders shows no signs of that. He collected more than $6 million in the 24 hours after winning the New Hampshire primary. On Saturday, the Vermont senator asked his backers to continue to lend their financial support, saying that ""taking on the establishment"" isn't easy.Still, he'll need to notch some quick wins if he is to seriously threaten Mrs. Clinton. ""He has the money and resources to keep going, but he needed Nevada to fuel his momentum because he will lose South Carolina,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist who is neutral in the race.""Realistically, this hill became very high to climb,"" Mr. Kofinis said. ""Short of a stunning loss [by Mrs. Clinton] on Super Tuesday, we're seeing the limits of his candidacy.""Byron Tau contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",2/22/16
Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Vie for Rural Nevadans' Votes; Sparsely populated areas have outsize role in state's caucuses,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766586559?accountid=12768,"ELKO, Nev.--Hours away from the glam and glitter of Las Vegas, a fierce contest between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is playing out in the mountains and deserts of Nevada.State caucus rules give rural counties outsize weight in the delegate-allocation process, a directive aimed at ensuring candidates don't just campaign in the cities.Consequently, the road to victory in Saturday's Democratic caucuses runs through places like Elko, a small mountain mining community that is the closest thing to a major city in northeast Nevada, and Pahrump, a desert town of about 36,000 that boasts a handful of casinos, a couple of brothels--and Clinton and Sanders campaign field offices.And both campaigns are working these sparsely populated communities, phoning supporters daily and driving to remote houses on dirt roads that aren't on the maps to knock on doors and see if the people who answer might need a lift to caucus sites.Mr. Sanders brought his pitch to Elko on Friday, a picturesque mountain town of 20,000 people that lies more than 300 miles north of Las Vegas in a conservative part of the state. He was following Mrs. Clinton, who flew in earlier in the week. Republican candidates, who hold their caucuses Tuesday, were expected to start arriving in northern Nevada over the next few days.""Tomorrow, the eyes of America and the eyes of much of the world are going to focus on Nevada,"" Mr. Sanders said at a rally. ""And the issue is not just who wins the Democratic nomination. The issue is whether Nevada will play a leading role in moving this country toward a political revolution which transforms this country--whether the people of Nevada will say enough is enough.""I'm here today in Elko to ask your support in the Democratic caucus tomorrow. Let us go forward together,"" he said.With polls showing the race as a dead heat, Mr. Sanders spent the day before the caucuses stumping in Elko and Reno before returning to Las Vegas for a large rally. Mrs. Clinton made stops in both Reno and Elko earlier in the week.Though the overwhelming majority of the state's people live in and around Las Vegas, campaigns ignore the rural areas at their own peril. In the 2008 Democratic race between Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama, she won the state but Mr. Obama collected more delegates in part because of a stronger organization and presence in the rural areas.""She won the popular vote, but she did not win the caucus because caucuses are based on delegates,"" said Joan Kato, a former aide to Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign who now serves as the state director for Mr. Sanders. Nevada has 23 delegates up for grabs in this year's caucuses.That was a mistake her campaign didn't plan to repeat. She has offices in Elko, Pahrump, and Carson City, and organizers across the state. Mr. Sanders has 12 field offices, though his campaign started organizing in Nevada months after Mrs. Clinton arrived.The Clinton campaign says its staffers logged 1,250 miles across rural Nevada last summer, sending senior campaign leaders into communities like Ely, Winnemucca, Hawthorne, and Tonopah for a listening tour that helped shape the campaign's rural strategy.Former President Bill Clinton also visited Pahrump this month and spoke to a few hundred people at a local elementary school.Gabe Alvare, a 24-year-old Clinton volunteer visiting from New York City, spent hours knocking on doors of known supporters on Wednesday in Pahrump, making sure they planned to show up for the caucus. He had stopped at many of the same houses a few days earlier. He offered Clinton yard signs, but there were no takers. Nye County is predominately Republican, and some of the people seemed reluctant to post a yard sign that might antagonize neighbors.At the wheel of the GMC pickup truck in which Mr. Alvare traveled was Clinton volunteer Frank Dix, 73, who lives in Pahrump and feels a special loyalty to the Clinton family.""I'm partial to strong women,"" Mr. Dix said. ""Hillary dealt with Bill. That's what my wife says about me. She says, 'I had to be strong, because otherwise Frank would run all over me.' ""Navigating can be a challenge. The recession hit Pahrump hard, and construction on some roads seemed to stop before completion.""We go where the houses are, not where the roads are,"" Mr. Dix said.There is no surefire way to get people to turn up at the caucus sites. One person mentioned that softball practice posed a potential conflict. A woman said her husband was planning to go, but he hasn't been feeling good lately.There have been some reassuring moments for Messrs. Alvare and Dix. Helaine Jennings, a 69-year-old retiree, answered her door and said she was all-in for Mrs. Clinton. When Mr. Alvare asked if she needed a ride, she declined. ""We have two legs,"" she said. ""It's very close.""At a spartan office nearby, the Sanders campaign was also working to get out the vote. Volunteers were making calls and planning a mock caucus session so attendees would know what to expect on Saturday.Rick Bandell, a 75-year-old retiree, said he was thrilled to call one home and persuade an entire family to show up in support of Mr. Sanders.""I got four people in one call,"" he said. ""They're going to caucus for Bernie. It's very unusual. I'd be happy to just to get one.""Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nye County, which includes Pahrump, by about 3 to 2, and the GOP complexion of the town is evident. At Mom's Diner, next to the Clinton campaign office, 10 Pahrump supporters of GOP candidate Ted Cruz were meeting for lunch and plotting strategy.What was also clear was that people of Pahrump were dialed in to the race.At the Lakeside Casino and RV Park, 63-year-old Leanette Robertson paused from her video-poker game to discuss the Sanders-Clinton contest. She favors Mrs. Clinton but wasn't sure she would be able to go to the caucuses because she had family visiting.""She's got a broad spectrum of issues she's supporting,"" Ms. Robertson said of Mrs. Clinton. ""It's not just the money issue. Bernie seems to be focused on one issue: the 1% of the 1%.""Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau",2/22/16
"Nevada Union's Silence Clouds Caucus; Clinton, Sanders battle for support of culinary workers after group forgoes endorsement",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766586452?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS--Eight years ago, Nevada's powerful Culinary Union mobilized to support its chosen candidate, Barack Obama, helping to boost turnout in the Democratic presidential caucuses and build credibility for what was still a long-shot campaign.This time around, casino workers and their family members are up for grabs.Leading into Saturday's Democratic caucus, the Culinary Union has withheld an endorsement, adding to the uncertainty around voter turnout and the outcome. It has also pushed the campaigns of Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to go to aggressive lengths to find and court the union workers who cook, wash dishes, waitress and clean rooms in this tourism mecca.Mr. Sanders came to the union offices last year even before he announced he was running for president, and he showed up this week at a protest outside a hospital, which Mrs. Clinton also attended. Earlier, his representatives went into employee dining halls at casinos and talked to workers while wearing union pins, a tactic the union said was inappropriate. Mr. Sanders' campaign chalked the issue up to a misunderstanding.Mrs. Clinton in November appeared at an organizing rally outside a hotel co-owned by Donald Trump to support a union-organizing campaign there. She has met union members at several casinos in the last week.""Both have shown a lot of support to come speak to us,"" said Nelson Lucero, a barista at the New York New York casino, who said he hadn't settled on a candidate. ""I think that's really important.""With 57,000 members, the culinary workers' union, which is overwhelmingly Hispanic and Democratic, dominates state politics to an extent nearly unmatched elsewhere.In past campaigns, the union made up much of the ground game for the candidates it supported. Part of its strength comes from being able to freely visit workers and talk to them about politics in the employee-only backhouses of casinos.That was a factor in the 2008 and 2012 presidential races, as well as in Democratic Sen. Harry Reid's tight re-election campaign in 2010. The union also played a role in ousting several Republican state legislators, according to state political experts.A variety of factors this year led the executive board of the Culinary Union's parent union, Unite Here, to vote in January not to endorse a candidate. The union has said that the primary factor in that decision was contract negotiations that are taking up time and resources.""We made the decision to focus on union business over political business,"" said Yvanna Cancela, the union's political director.One key issue, according to several people familiar with the matter, was a dispute with the Obama administration over some aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The union fought the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% excise-tax increase on high-cost health-care plans, including those covering Culinary Union members. Mr. Obama signed into law a two-year delay on the tax late last year, but he had refused the union's demands that the tax be removed altogether.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders both supported the removal, but union officials wanted more evidence they would work against it, people familiar with the matter said.The union learned that it ""should expect more from politicians than campaign promises,"" one person familiar with its thinking said.The AFL-CIO, the national union organization of which Unite Here is a part, also said this week that it wouldn't endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.For the Culinary Union, the nonendorsement allows it to avoid some of the awkward infighting that occurred eight years ago, when it endorsed Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton won the largest number of votes in the caucuses, but Mr. Obama won the most delegates.Chad Neanover, a prep cook at the Margaritaville restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip, said he faced resistance when he talked to co-workers about Mr. Obama.""I was having people who were 100% die-hard for Hillary,"" he said. ""It was uncomfortable that so many people were upset over it.""The union's decision not to endorse a candidate could have implications for state Democrats in the fall. Some close to the Culinary Union say that with the union sitting out recent elections, they sense enthusiasm for politics could be down.But Ms. Cancela said the union plans to heavily re-engage ahead of the general election to support the Democratic nominee.It has started preparing by launching an organizing drive to gain citizenship for its members, so that they will be able to vote, and to register 12,000 additional members to vote. ""They've already committed to working really hard in the general,"" said Mr. Reid. ""That's when we need it.""Write to Alexandra Berzon at alexandra.berzon@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Alexandra Berzon and Peter Nicholas",2/22/16
"Ip's Take: How Sanders, Trump Threaten Market Confidence; The Wall Street Journal's financial regulation newsletter for Thursday, February 18, 2016",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766173851?accountid=12768,"Ip's Take: How Sanders, Trump Threaten Market ConfidenceU.K. Finance Sector Has Most at Stake in EU Membership TalksFed's Kashkari: To Have 'Actionable Plan' for Breaking Up Big Banks by Year's EndThe Real Crisis Is for Bank Bonds, Not BanksChina's ICBC Offices in Spain Raided in Money-Laundering ProbeHow Sanders, Trump Threaten Market ConfidenceMarkets don't usually pay a lot of attention to presidential elections. For all the campaign theatrics, presidents from both parties, once in office, tend to hew to economic orthodoxy, whether on free trade or the independence of the Federal Reserve.This would be a good year to jettison those assumptions.Much as the global financial crisis tripped up economists in 2008, so too has the presidential campaign made a mockery of political soothsaying.Only now are investors grappling with the possibility that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist and leader of a ""political revolution,"" or Republican Donald Trump, a reality-TV personality who devises policy on the fly, could actually be president. Either would foreshadow unprecedented uncertainty and potential upheaval in government policy.The risk lies not just in their policies, which are radical enough. Mr. Sanders would break up the big banks, introduce universal government-funded health care and raise the federal minimum wage to $15. Mr. Trump would slap steep tariffs on imports from China and Mexico and build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out immigrants.The greater risk is that both men represent a rejection of economic orthodoxy. They don't especially care that mainstream economists pan their proposals. Neither, apparently, do their growing ranks of supporters. A public whose inflation-adjusted incomes have been ratcheting downward since 1999 and overwhelmingly believes the country is on the wrong track may feel it has little to lose from unorthodox ideas.Is that so bad?Thus far, there is no coherent economics evident in the policies of Mr. Trump. Asked to name an economic adviser, his campaign cites billionaire hedge-fund manager Carl Icahn. Illegal immigrants from Mexico are central villains in his narrative of American decline, though their ranks have been falling since 2007.Mr. Sanders puts more thought into his policies and has found some economists to back them. Nonetheless, his ideas are driven less by economic evidence than a deeply entrenched, ideological view of a world stacked in favor of business and the rich.Messrs. Sanders and Trump didn't achieve their popularity in a vacuum. Many in Congress and the broader public share their populist distrust of globalization and finance. That imperils the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the institution about which markets care most: the Federal Reserve. Many in Congress see it not as economists do--as the savior of the economy--but as a handmaiden to the banks or an unaccountable enabler of fiscal profligacy.The Fed usually depends on the White House to protect it from congressional meddling, but in recent years it has lost legislative battles over the makeup of its board of governors and the use of its earnings. President Obama did promise to veto a Republican-backed House bill that would have subjected the Fed to invasive audits. Presumably a president Sanders, who backed a similar bill in the Senate, would have signed it.From China to oil, markets already have plenty to worry about. To that list they can now add a possible president that presides over a circumscribed central bank, escalating trade conflict or a stepped-up assault on Wall Street.Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and BeyondU.K. Finance Sector Has Most at Stake in EU Membership TalksIt is ironic that Prime Minister David Cameron's negotiations on European Union membership should run into last-minute trouble over his attempts to secure protections for the City of London from the consequences of future eurozone integration.After all, the City itself has hardly been clamoring for these protections, having long since made its peace with the idea of EU regulation. Even officials in London and Brussels privately consider the demands to be largely window-dressing designed to cover up an otherwise largely threadbare list of U.K. reform demands. More to the point, there is no British industry with more at stake from a failed renegotiation that leads to a British EU exit.After all, the City itself has hardly been clamoring for these protections, having long since made its peace with the idea of EU regulation.

Mr. Kashkari, in an interview Wednesday on CNBC, acknowledged progress in regulating big banks since the 2008 financial crisis, but questioned whether regulators would have used those new powers to deal with that crisis.Transcript of Neel Kashkari's Interview With WSJ Reporters and Editors: 25% Capital Requirement May Be Right for BanksBreak Up the Big Banks? Do This FirstThe Real Crisis Is for Bank Bonds, Not BanksEurope clearly has unresolved issues to address in its fragmented banking system. But this is hardly news. The issue lies more with the securities and the investors that hold them than the balance sheets of the banks that issued them.The big risk that investors have woken up to isn't that these bonds can be bailed-in if a bank hits trouble--it is that interest payments on them can be skipped under certain circumstances. In turn, falling prices have raised concerns that banks won't exercise their option to redeem them at the first opportunity, requiring a further repricing downwards.China's ICBC Offices in Spain Raided in Money-Laundering ProbeSpanish authorities raided the headquarters of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. in Spain, detaining five directors Wednesday under the orders of a judge investigating one of the world's largest lenders for alleged money laundering.Spanish and European law-enforcement officials are probing the Chinese bank's Spanish unit for the alleged laundering of at least [euro]40 million ($44.4 million) that suspected criminal organizations had deposited at the lender, Europol, Europe's law-enforcement coordinating body, said in a statement.Boeing Chief Defends StrategyBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Wednesday defended the aerospace company's accounting practices and corporate strategy in the wake of weeks of volatile stock movements. The company's shares have slumped almost 20% this year on concerns about its cash generation and competitive position, and took another hit last week following a media report that the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its financial projections.For Foundation Capital, Deals Proved ElusiveFormer Wall Street executive Dean Barr thought he had the next big thing: Instead of investing in hedge funds, put money into companies that manage them. It didn't work out. Seven years after launching, Foundation Capital Partners LLC has closed down, with the Greenwich, Conn.-based company having never closed a deal, according to people familiar with the matter.Hedge Funds Deliver Evidence in Porsche Executives' TrialA decade-old takeover battle involving Volkswagen AG is coming to a head at a trial in Stuttgart, Germany, with fresh evidence delivered by hedge funds that lost billions of dollars shorting the company's shares during an aborted takeover. The criminal trial concerns alleged stock manipulation by executives at Porsche SE, the holding company that owned the sports-car maker when it tried to buy the much larger Volkswagen in 2008.Jacob Schlesinger and the reporters and the editors of WSJ Pro Financial Regulation welcome your questions.

For banks, there is growing concern from analysts that even slightly negative rates can seriously suppress profits.That's a big issue in the eurozone, where the European Central Bank began pushing some of its policy rates below zero in June 2014. In a research note published Wednesday, Morgan Stanley MS +2.31% analysts suggested that another 0.10 percentage point cut in the ECB's deposit rate would erode bank profits by 5-10%. So, a small step further into negative territory can cause profits to slump by considerably more.THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 188:30 a.m.Sean McKessy, head of the SEC's whistleblower office, and William Hicks, associate director of the agency's Atlanta office, talk about SEC whistleblower actions at Emory University Law School.FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 198:45 a.m.SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White speaks at the Practising Law Institute/SEC annual ""SEC Speaks"" conference in Washington, D.C.THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 258:15 a.m.-5 p.m.The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Louisiana State University's Graduate School of Banking hold the 2016 Banking Outlook Conference in Atlanta.Financial Fines Declined in 2015The tally of public financial penalties imposed in the U.S. in 2015 amounted to $18.6 billion, down from the levels seen in 2013 and 2014, said the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, adding that financial institutions continue to face historically unprecedented fines.Dodd-Frank Boosted Fed's Rule-Making PaceThe Federal Reserve's rule-making activity increased as much over the four years after the Dodd-Frank law was enacted in 2010 as it did during the decade and a half prior to the law's creation, says the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, a free-market-oriented think tank.The SEC said former Deutsche Bank research analyst Charles Grom issued a stock rating that was inconsistent with his personal view, a violation of SEC rules. Mr. Grom will settle the case by paying a $100,000 penalty and will be suspended from the securities industry for one year. Mr. Grom neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings.Four leading Democratic economists sharply criticized Bernie Sanders, citing ""extreme claims"" about the economic effects of his presidential campaign proposals, which they say risk undercutting the Democrats' reputation as ""the party of responsible arithmetic.""House Republicans are asking the Obama administration to take a close look at a Chinese firm's deal to buy the Chicago Stock Exchange. The 134-year-old exchange, which handles a tiny fraction of U.S. equity trading, said this month it would be acquired by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group in a transaction that would close in the second half of the year. In a letter organized by Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.) , 46 House Republicans asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, to conduct a ""full and rigorous investigation into this proposed acquisition,"" saying the buyer could have ties to the Chinese government. Cfius reviews the purchase of U.S. businesses on national security grounds, and U.S. regulators tend to view financial infrastructure as highly sensitive.Japan's government has put off a plan to let its $1.1 trillion public pension fund buy and sell stocks directly, following criticism that the move could lead to excessive state influence on the market.Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.

"Young and Black in South Carolina: How Will They Vote? Most African-American students back Bernie Sanders, according to interviews; Hillary Clinton still expected to win primary thanks to support from older black voters",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766910917?accountid=12768,"COLUMBIA, S.C.--A striking pattern is emerging in the Democratic presidential primary, with Bernie Sanders energizing young voters and Hillary Clinton relying on African-American backers to create an insurmountable edge for her candidacy.Those data points raise a question: How will those who are both young and black vote in Saturday's South Carolina primary?""Most of my friends are for Bernie,"" said Edith Dunlap, a student at Clemson University who blames President Bill Clinton's administration for increasing the country's prison population--including members of her own family. ""None of us really trust Hillary or understand what her vision would be.""Mrs. Clinton is ahead in the polls here largely because of her support from black voters, a strength that helped propel her to victory in Saturday's Nevada caucuses and one expected to bring her a win in Saturday's primary here.But Mr. Sanders has gained a deep following among black college students, according to more than three dozen interviews across five universities with students, professors, university administrators and longtime political observers.While Mrs. Clinton leads 68% to 21% among black voters, which make up more than 50% of turnout in South Carolina, her lead shrinks to 52% to 35% among black voters under 45, according to the latest WSJ/NBC News poll.Many of the college students interviewed by The Wall Street Journal said they argue with their pro-Clinton parents and grandparents as they embrace Mr. Sanders's calls for free college tuition and more aggressive actions to curb Wall Street excesses.Marcurius Byrd, a first-year law school student at the University of South Carolina, won his mother over to Mr. Sanders's side but his father is still backing Mrs. Clinton, for now.""Hillary just doesn't inspire the change that is necessary to build on [President Barack] Obama's legacy and really keep us moving forward,"" he said. ""My dad is just getting introduced to Bernie Sanders.""The Clinton name is potent in South Carolina, which delivered a decisive 1992 victory for Mr. Clinton that he credits with sending him to the White House. A Southern Democrat who appealed to blue-collar voters, Mr. Clinton had a long relationship with civil-rights leaders in the state and presided over a period of economic prosperity here that older black voters remember.Black legislators also recall fondly that Mr. Clinton knew every word to ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" dubbed the ""black national anthem."" Many older voters simply say they don't know Mr. Sanders and question his commitment to their communities. ""Clinton was our first black president,"" said Blossom Lordman, a 42-year-old waitress in Greenville. ""He was the black president before Obama.""Yet when Mr. Clinton returned to the state in 2008, he caught flak for comments that seemed dismissive of Jesse Jackson and Mr. Obama. The Clintons and black lawmakers have moved on from that moment, as the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Mrs. Clinton this month.At the University of South Carolina, many students are kicking the tires of the Clinton legacy and questioning its impact on neighborhoods and families, said Bobby Donaldson, a history and African-American Studies professor who leads a dorm of 229 students.His colleague, Todd Shaw, a black political scientist, said his students are also largely backing Mr. Sanders. ""Clinton is increasingly selling herself as the next chapter of the Obama administration,"" Mr. Donaldson said. ""It's Sanders who is saying we will champion the audacity of hope.""Many of their elders don't understand the impulse. They agree with Mrs. Clinton's frequent suggestion she can accomplish more--and question the commitment of Mr. Sanders to their communities. Fletcher Smith, a longtime state representative who recently introduced Mr. Clinton, said he had tried to reason with younger voters.""The young people didn't have to suffer like we did,"" Mr. Smith said. ""They didn't go through everything we've been through. We've been through a whole lot with the Clintons, and we haven't seen a whole lot from Bernie.""To be sure, many college students are also embracing Mrs. Clinton.Angel Risher wore her Miss Allen University sash and tiara to recent rallies for both the Clinton and Sanders camps. The student at Allen, a private, historically black institution, said she is picking Mrs. Clinton, inspired by Bill Clinton's half-hour synopsis of his wife's accomplishments.Herbert Johnson III, a 20-year-old junior at Allen from St. George, S.C., said he was supporting Mrs. Clinton because of her brand and association with Mr. Clinton. ""She's got that feeling like she'd be a good president.""Yet at campuses across the state, Mr. Sanders is generating more excitement, according to students and activists. During a recent event at the University of South Carolina, dozens of hands went into the air when students were asked if they had seen Mr. Sanders, while several had attended a Clinton event.Joe Fretwell, the student body president at Furman University and a Clinton supporter, said it often made sense to canvass in predominantly black neighborhoods around campus because Mr. Sanders was so popular among students.""Every time I get on Facebook I see him,"" said Wallace Moore, a sophomore at Allen University.Both campaigns are trying to woo black college students in the state, yet it remains uncertain how many of the students are registered to vote--and how many will actually go to the polls.Mr. Sanders has young volunteers going door to door and is advertising on black radio, said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a prominent black Democratic state legislator. ""I believe the Clinton campaign had taken the state and the voters in this state for granted up until a few weeks ago,"" she said. ""They're lucky that we're one week out,"" she added, limiting Mr. Sanders's time to make even further inroads with voters.Write to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.comCredit: By Josh Dawsey and Valerie Bauerlein",2/23/16
Bernie Sanders's Free Tuition Failed a Cost Test in Past; Cities and states couldn't afford programs of the type championed by the Democratic presidential candidate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767408073?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Eighteen-year-old Bernie Sanders didn't pay tuition for his freshman year at Brooklyn College in 1959, nor did any other of the college's roughly 17,000 full-time undergraduates.New York City's public colleges didn't charge tuition back then. Students at University of California campuses and a number of other colleges around the country had a similar deal back then. Although free tuition helped tens of thousands of working-class students afford bachelor degrees, the policy was eventually scrapped as costs escalated.Now, Mr. Sanders wants to reinstate free tuition, but on a scale that dwarfs anything that came before. Public colleges should be like public high schools, the Vermont Democrat argues: no charge for instruction.""In 2016, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of what a high-school degree was 50 or 60 years ago, in terms of going out and getting a good job,"" Mr. Sanders said on MSNBC earlier this month.The tuition proposal is one of the reasons Mr. Sanders's presidential bid has a big following on campuses, though his plan has been derided by his opponents as pie-in-the-sky or wasteful. Earlier this month, after the MSNBC session, the campaign of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton put out a press release headlined ""Millionaires don't need free college."" She said any tuition assistance should be targeted to the poor or middle class.A look at the history of the free-tuition movement gives a sense of what is politically feasible today, as families struggle with $1.2 trillion of student debt and difficulty affording college at all. Free-tuition colleges flourished at a time when student enrollment was small ""and there was great optimism and interest in supporting higher education"" among state lawmakers, said University of California at Berkeley education researcher John Aubrey Douglass.Not charging for instruction was less a matter of ideology than practicality, say economic and education historians. As the industrial revolution reshaped 19th and early 20th century America, city and state legislatures sought to increase the number of teachers, engineers, agricultural experts and other professionals who could help local industries and farms.The University of California dates to 1868 and initially focused on agriculture, mining and medicine. The City University of New York started as the Free Academy of New York in 1849, which educated immigrants, and morphed into a broader university. For many years, the State University of New York's ""normal"" schools, which trained future teachers, also didn't charge tuition.Even those state colleges that had tuition charged minimal amounts. In 1933, the average in-state undergraduate tuition, plus fees, was about $1,100 in today's dollars, according estimates by Harvard University economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz. By 2015, the College Board said, in-state tuition in four-year public colleges had jumped to $9,410.State colleges could charge so little because relatively few people went to college. In 1959, when Mr. Sanders studied at Brooklyn College, 2.2 million students attended public colleges nationally, the Education Department estimates. Enrollment now is 15.3 million. The cost of educating so many more students outstripped the willingness--or ability--of city and state legislatures to pay the tab.The City University of New York started charging for tuition in 1976 after the city teetered on the brink of bankruptcy, and the university ran out of money.The city's finances had become a shambles, said a study by the New York Fed in 1976, because of a huge increase in spending on social services as the city's manufacturing sector collapsed and its middle class exodus accelerated. Social Services jumped to 23% of the city's budget in 1975 from 13% in 1965. Spending on education--at all levels--also took a bigger bite out of city finances.In 1975, undergraduate enrollment at Brooklyn College, one of CUNY's largest campuses, had almost doubled to 30,000 undergraduates from the time Mr. Sanders attended college there.The University of California dropped free tuition in a less dramatic fashion. Over time, it charged students increasingly high ""fees""--about $2,800 in 1975, adjusted for inflation--until it finally embraced the term ""tuition"" during the economic downturn of the early 1990s, said Mr. Douglass. Undergraduate enrollment at that college tripled between 1960 and 1990 to 125,000 students.In both New York and California, free tuition packed a powerful political punch and was only discarded under economic duress. Even during New York City's financial crisis, the city initially rejected termination of free tuition, wrote Judith Glazer Raymo, an emeritus professor at Long Island University, in a history of free tuition.""The struggle to adopt tuition might jeopardize support from middle-class students"" who might go elsewhere if they had to pay, she wrote.That broad base of support is a big reason Mr. Sanders wants universal free tuition at state schools instead of targeting middle- and lower-income students. Think of Social Security, said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's policy director.""It's not important that Bill Gates gets a Social Security check,"" he said. If you limit the program, ""after a while, people complain that it's just a welfare program"" and political support evaporates, he said.But making the program universal drives up costs, which the Sanders campaign estimates at $750 billion over 10 years.Mr. Sanders would pay for that by taxing the sales of securities, a plan that would be bound to encounter fierce resistance from Wall Street. Economists argue that such a tax would depress stock prices somewhat and drive up interest rates on bonds.For Mr. Gunnels, the combination of free tuition and a financial transaction tax is part of what Mr. Sanders calls the ""political revolution"" necessary to bring about change.""When the Senate and House hold a vote, [a President Sanders] would be able to look out at the mall and see one million or two million college students marching,"" Mr. Gunnels said.Nothing like that was needed to bring free tuition into existence early on--and student protests weren't sufficient to stop the programs from eventually being scrapped. Free tuition was replaced with the current system, and that system has helped produce a vast increase in enrollment, an expansion of state university facilities, and heavy student debt.Returning to free tuition, even if it were possible, would create its own problems, argued Roger Geiger, a Pennsylvania State University education professor. Free tuition would explode enrollment at state schools that are already having trouble handling current enrollment.Weak liberal arts colleges would be forced out of business by low-cost competition and elite ones would depend even more on wealthier students who could afford to pay tuition. ""This would cause more inequality,"" he said, the opposite of what Mr. Sanders seeks.No way, responds Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders policy chief. With millions of students scrambling to pay college loans, he said, ""the idea that making public colleges and universities tuition-free would somehow increase inequality is absurd.""As for Mr. Sanders, he finished his undergraduate degree at the private University of Chicago, one of the nation's most elite schools. His campaign declined to comment on his college decisions and how they were paid for.Shortly after he graduated, the school doubled its tuition to help pay for a building spree at the university and a big increase in enrollment.Credit: By Bob Davis",2/24/16

"Bernie Sanders Fans Go Online to Volunteer, Crash--and Date; Young, tech-savvy volunteers create apps and websites to track his popularity, prod donors and find places to sleep",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769027433?accountid=12768,"CAMDEN, S.C.-- On Sunday, a makeshift family of Bernie Sanders volunteers rose early. They dispersed toward Virginia, Georgia and other Super Tuesday states, stirred by a love for Mr. Sanders's scrappy idealism and aided by a website that connected them to Sanders supporters with spare rooms and couches.Mr. Sanders had lost the day before by 48 points to Hillary Clinton in South Carolina's Democratic primary, a blow to the dozen volunteers who had arrived from across the country to knock on doors for the Vermont senator, then crash at an empty-nester's sprawling house they found on the website BernieBNB.com .The young, tech-savvy fans who have flocked to Mr. Sanders have created a constellation of apps and websites to track his popularity, prod new donors and even send pizza to campaign offices.Three months ago, New Yorker Will Lockhart knew Mr. Sanders only as ""that guy who yells in the Senate."" Soon, ubiquitous social media chatter convinced Mr. Lockhart, a 25-year-old physics graduate student, to download a phone-bank app for calling voters and turn to other apps to find ways to get to South Carolina.""If Bernie wins,"" Mr. Lockhart said, ""it's because of the Internet.""While other campaigns have hired top digital strategists, promote official mobile apps and maintain a substantial social media presence, none have been supported by a distributed network of volunteer coders and online denizens like Mr. Sanders's has.Independent of the senator's campaign apparatus, his backers have created a variety of websites and apps--from Bernie selfie filters to mobile games like Flappy Bern, a take on the addictive iPhone game Flappy Bird.Some, like Bernie BNB, serve to connect Mr. Sanders's supporters in real life, reminiscent of 2004 Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean's Meetup.com groups. Others are political twists on relatively new technology, akin to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's use of radio to build popular support for the New Deal in the 1930s.Mrs. Clinton has nearly four times as many Twitter followers as Mr. Sanders has, while GOP favorite Donald Trump has almost twice as many followers on Instagram. Yet an online search for dating, room-hosting and transportation apps developed by supporters of Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio turned up little comparable to what Sanders backers have created.In New York City, the loss in South Carolina was an immediate topic of conversation at Jeremiah Pegues's first date Saturday with a young woman he had met on Bernie Singles, he said.""People are uniting around the one thing you usually do not mention on a date,"" Mr. Pegues said. ""Because people so freely talk about their political persuasion they will get their religious affiliations out of the way, too.""Susan Aiken, a mother of three grown sons who posted her house in rural Camden, S.C., on Bernie BNB, discovered that hosting a diverse, young crowd was renewing. ""Our future is set,"" said Ms. Aiken, who plans to go out on the road campaigning herself.The rotating cast of volunteers spent anywhere from a night to a week with her, sharing cooking duties and swapping stories from the campaign trail late into the night.Like most new technological phenomena, the Internet of Bernie has a few quirks. Sanders backers can use Bernie BNB to find six places to stay in Raleigh, N.C., in the run-up to the state's March 15 primary, but would have to book one without the benefit of pictures or reviews.""What I would consider my vetting system is that these people are Bernie supporters,"" said Erica Calegari of San Francisco. After a quick phone call, she stayed for a couple of nights with a male host in Columbia, S.C., a leap of faith she said she wouldn't normally take with a stranger.Bernie Singles, meantime, has been beset by Trump ""trolls"" who mock and harass the Sanders fans looking for dates. As many as 100 new members a day have registered with a version of the name Donald Trump. They fill the chat rooms with questions such as ""How do you propose to pay for Mr. Sanders's promises?""On Sunday, Bernie Singles members were trying to boost each other's spirits, musing over an illustration of Hillary Clinton wearing a backward baseball cap and holding a skateboard, a dig at what some see as her disconnect from young voters. ""Hillary trying to be one with the kids but Bernie is everywhere,"" said one user, Cecilia R., who uploaded the image to a chat room.Write to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com and Douglas MacMillan at douglas.macmillan@wsj.comCredit: By Valerie Bauerlein and Douglas MacMillan",3/2/16
"Sanders Campaign Evolves From Small Startup to Election Machine; Vermont senator's once-struggling operation ramps up fundraising, spending",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769017802?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Once a simple pleasure, a walk outdoors for Bernie Sanders and his wife Jane is now a complicated logistical challenge with an entourage in tow.A Secret Service detail accompanies the couple everywhere, and finding time between frenetic rounds of flights, rallies and phone calls is no small feat.""When there is a break in the schedule, he'll bolt for a walk,"" Mrs. Sanders said in an interview. ""It was in the low teens in Wisconsin (on a recent campaign stop) and we said, 'Hey, we can either eat lunch or go for a walk.' So we went for a walk.""Not so long ago the Sanders campaign had the feel of a startup inching its way toward relevance. Nearly a year after launching, it has evolved into a more professionalized operation that looks and feels like a modern presidential campaign, with all the complications that entails. Money is pouring in--and rushing out the door.After holding out for months following his April 2015 entry into the primary race, Mr. Sanders agreed over the summer to hire a polling expert--although he didn't start paying for surveys until the fall. A voter modeling firm that worked for Barack Obama's 2008 campaign now helps the campaign reach targeted voters.""At the beginning, when they were talking about it (polling) we were like, 'We don't want polling,'"" Mrs. Sanders said. ""And then we finally said, 'OK, if you feel you need it for the ads, that's fine, but we're going to approve the ads. You're not going to say anything we don't want to say.' ""The campaign has been spending more heavily on TV ads and staff than at any point in the race. In January, the Sanders campaign spent about $35 million--$15 million more than was spent by rival Hillary Clinton, marking the first time Mr. Sanders has outspent the former secretary of state. It was the first fundraising period when the Sanders campaign spent more than it raised; Mr. Sanders raised $21 million in January.Mr. Sanders's spending on ads leapt to $14 million in January, up from on average $3.5 million a month in the previous quarter.Overall, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has outspent Mr. Sanders, according to the most recent filings: She paid out $97 million through the end of January, to his $81 million.There is no sign donations are drying up, though; the campaign said Monday that it raised more than $42 million in February alone, its biggest monthly haul to date.It is unclear how far Mr. Sanders's money and organization will carry him. He was walloped in South Carolina on Saturday and Clinton aides are confident that after 11 states vote on Tuesday they will be well on their way to an insurmountable lead in delegates. Still, veterans of presidential campaigns say they are impressed by what Mr. Sanders has built so far.David Plouffe, campaign manager for Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign and now a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, said in an interview: ""He's run an amazing campaign. Who would have imagined that he would have put together this kind of an organization?""A newcomer to national politics, the junior senator from Vermont has presided over a dramatic expansion of a campaign apparatus that initially struggled to keep up with the large crowds and attention he commanded.Tad Devine, a senior Sanders adviser, said this wasn't a case in which the candidate had been plotting a presidential run for years. Preparations were minimal. A week before Mr. Sanders declared his candidacy on April 30th, Mr. Devine said he met privately with Mr. Sanders and his wife and came away unsure about their intentions.""When I left I didn't know which way it was going to go,"" he said, adding that on the day of the announcement, ""There was no account, no real money, no headquarters and no organization.""Last summer, Mr. Sanders was seen trundling through airports waiting for his group to be called by Southwest Airlines gate agents. His motorcade consisted of a single rental car driven by an aide. Now he flies on chartered jets and rides inside the cocoon of Secret Service vehicles.Some of the dynamics remain unchanged. Mr. Sanders still feels he has no need for a speechwriter and typically writes most of the material he uses in stump speech.Atop the campaign hierarchy are the same small group of advisers who have been with him for years. ""The core of the campaign remains the same,"" Mrs. Sanders said. ""A half dozen of us"" are involved in the ""major decisions and strategy and plans.""But layers of aides have been added. The campaign's spending has substantially expanded in recent months. In January, it spent $2.5 million on more than 560 staffers in nearly every state, compared with spending on average of $1.9 million a month in the final quarter of 2015.He didn't start spending a substantial amount on polling until December, when he paid out about $250,000 to a San Francisco-based firm for ""research/polling."" In January, he paid the firm, Tulchin Research, more than double that amount--a total of about $600,000, disclosure records show.Mr. Sanders has also increased his reliance on outside consultants. His most recent filing showed his campaign paid at least nine consulting firms nearly $1 million in January, up from a total of about $600,000 in the last three months of 2015.In his first filing after announcing his campaign, he reported paying just four of those consulting firms a total of less than $30,000.In the fall, Mr. Sanders hired HaystaqDNA, a predictive analytics firm that helps campaigns target their messages, and in January he began ramping up payments to the company. Of the $730,000 the campaign has paid the firm since October, about $500,000 was paid out in January. HaystaqDNA was also contracted by Mr. Obama's campaign in 2008.As much as Mr. Sanders talks about creating a political ""revolution,"" the new aides are following the conventions of modern campaigning.In a tiny office in remote Pahrump, Nev., before the state's caucuses on Feb. 20, sat a paid Sanders campaign field organizer. When asked about the race, he said he needed permission to talk. He got on his cellphone to make the request--and was told to stay silent.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Rebecca Ballhaus",3/2/16

She planned to spend the evening in Miami.Tuesday marks the busiest day on the primary calendar and one with the largest number of convention delegates up for grabs. For Democrats, 859 delegates will be allocated, more than a third of the 2,383 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.

Bernie Sanders Plays Down Long Odds; The Democrat says he sees a path to win and keeps up his swipes against front-runner Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768486336?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he has a pathway to win the nomination, playing down a stinging defeat in South Carolina that reflected heavy losses among African-American voters and tested the viability of his campaign.""We got decimated,"" Mr. Sanders said Sunday on NBC. But he said that ""we're looking to the future--not looking back,"" and that while ""it's going to be a tough fight, I think we can pull it off.""African-American voters made up 61% of the electorate in South Carolina, and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, won 86% of their support, according to exit polls. That propelled her Saturday to a landslide win of 74% to 26% for Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator.Mr. Sanders on CBS predicted his campaign would do well in several states holding Democratic contests on Tuesday, including Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma, Massachusetts and Vermont.Looking further ahead, Mr. Sanders said he could win the delegate-rich states of California, Michigan and New York.Sunday in Oklahoma City, Mr. Sanders fired up the crowd with his signature brand of economic populism, calling for a higher minimum wage, increased Social Security benefits, paid family leave, government-guaranteed health care for all and tuition-free college. He begged voters to turn out at the polls.""The only way we make changes is when millions of people stand up and fight back,"" Mr. Sanders told an audience filled with cheering young people.Support among younger votes was a bright spot in the South Carolina contest for Mr. Sanders, who predicted that his left-of-center politics would prove appealing as the contest heads beyond the four early nominating states.""Tuesday, we're going to have over 800 delegates being selected,"" Mr. Sanders said on CBS. ""I think we're going to win a very good share of those delegates. The important point is that people throughout this country are resonating to our message.""Mr. Sanders continued to press his case against Mrs. Clinton, hitting her for being backed by a super PAC, which allows unlimited donations from large contributors, and calling on her to release transcripts of paid speeches made to Goldman Sachs Group. ""It has to be an unbelievably great speech,"" Mr. Sanders jabbed.In seeking to sharpen the contrast with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders also turned his attention to foreign policy. That subject fueled then-Sen. Barack Obama's rise to the White House in 2008, when he relentlessly attacked Mrs. Clinton for voting to authorize the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq when she was a senator from New York.Mr. Sanders, who opposed the invasion, continues to hammer Mrs. Clinton for that vote as well as her later support, while she was secretary of state, for military intervention in Libya. In both cases, the U.S. intervention helped topple dictators but failed to create stable political systems in the aftermath.""You can't just go forward with regime change--you've got to be thinking about the day after,"" Mr. Sanders said on NBC. ""I think her approach to foreign policy and mine are just quite different.""Mrs. Clinton has said she made a mistake in voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq invasion, but she also has said that she understands the complexities of the Middle East better than Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders on Sunday picked up support from Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a member of National Guard. Ms. Gabbard, who becomes the fourth Democratic lawmaker in Congress to endorse the Vermont senator, quit her post as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in order to back Mr. Sanders.Ms. Gabbard said it was important to have a commander in chief ""who exercises good judgment"" so that ""we don't continue to find ourselves in these failures that have resulted in chaos in the Middle East.""Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.comCredit: By Siobhan Hughes and David Harrison",3/2/16
"Super Tuesday Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Leading in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee; Bernie Sanders expected to do well in some Super Tuesday states, including his home state of Vermont",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768421340?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton has built substantial leads over Sen. Bernie Sanders in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee ahead of Super Tuesday voting this week, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds.Eleven states and one U.S. territory hold Democratic primaries or caucuses on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders by 34 percentage points in Georgia, 26 points in Tennessee and 21 points in Texas, the survey findsHer lead is built in large part on commanding margins among African-American voters.Republican Poll* Trump Leads in Tennessee, Georgia; Cruz Ahead in TexasMrs. Clinton has a 54-point advantage in Georgia among African-Americans, who make up a majority of the likely Democratic voter pool, the poll finds. Mrs. Clinton has a 68-point advantage among African-Americans in Tennessee, where the poll finds that group accounting for about 30% of likely voters.Mrs. Clinton's lead is smaller among white voters in those states. She essentially divides that group in Georgia, carrying 50% to Mr. Sanders' 47%.The survey finds that in Texas, Latinos make up a slightly larger share of likely voters than do whites. Mrs. Clinton holds a 5-point lead over Mr. Sanders among Latino likely voters in the survey, while carrying whites by 17 percentage points and African-Americans by 58 points.Mr. Sanders is expected to do well in some Super Tuesday states, including his home state of Vermont. His campaign is eyeing wins in two states, Minnesota and Colorado, that hold caucuses, a forum in which a relatively small group of motivated supporters can swing the outcome.The strengths Mr. Sanders has carried into prior nominating contests are apparent in the new Journal/NBC/Marist poll. He wins among independent voters who say they'll participate in Democratic primaries in the three states surveyed, and he carries voters under age 45 in Tennessee and Texas. Those voter groups helped propel Mr. Sanders to a resounding win in New Hampshire and what essentially was a tie in Iowa.More* Hillary Clinton Wins South Carolina Democratic Primary* Hillary Clinton Defends Obama Record in Alabama Stop* Five Percent Growth?

Many of the 11 Super Tuesday states have large minority populations and relatively few independents in the Democratic voting pool, factors that favor Mrs. Clinton.For Mr. Sanders, the Texas polls show that he has made some inroads into the Latino community even has he continues to struggle with black voters. Mrs. Clinton narrowly edges out Mr. Sanders among likely Latino voters, 52% to 47%.The Journal/NBC/Marist poll of Georgia included 461 likely Democratic primary voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.The Texas survey included 381 likely Democratic voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

"As South Carolina Votes, Hillary Clinton's Southern Firewall Appears Poised to Pass First Test; Strong showing by Democratic front-runner, who holds big lead in polls, could hint to more struggles for Bernie Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768347383?accountid=12768,"COLUMBIA, S.C.--Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made their final pitches to voters in South Carolina, where a strong showing by Mrs. Clinton, who has a double-digit lead in the polls, could hint at more struggles for Mr. Sanders.South Carolina Democratic Party officials are expecting a good turnout during Saturday's voting. Democratic Party Chairman Jamie Harrison said this week he is expecting between 350,000 and 400,000 voters to cast ballots. South Carolina polls will close at 7 p.m. EST.Mrs. Clinton held an outdoor rally in Columbia on Friday night, where she pledged to build on President Barack Obama's legacy. ""We have work to do, but I'm excited about what we can do together,"" she told the crowd.She said the South Carolina primary is personally important to her and that she wants to send ""a strong signal"" Saturday that the state is ready for change.Former President Bill Clinton joined his wife on the trail Friday evening, calling their time in South Carolina a homecoming and telling voters that they can ""change the future of this country by voting for Hillary.""Mrs. Clinton, whose Southern firewall appears poised to pass its first test, has an eye on the Southern states that will vote on Super Tuesday, including Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Arkansas and Virginia.Her strength in the region, particularly among its many African-American Democratic voters, has been magnified by the Sanders campaign's decision not to try to match her investment here and elsewhere. Officials in some Super Tuesday states say they still are looking for indications that he is competing in the so-called SEC primary.A march outside a downtown Nashville coffee shop on Saturday will feature a half-dozen, life-size Bernie Sanders cutouts, but otherwise, there has been little sign of Mr. Sanders himself in Tennessee, Democrats said.""You kind of get the feel that he doesn't think it's worthwhile coming,"" said Randall Rice, head of the Tennessee Democratic County Chairs Association, who is neutral in the race. ""The Bernie group has come in and set up offices, but he's not been here as far as I know. Hillary has been here a few times.""Mrs. Clinton will be back in Tennessee on Sunday.Mr. Sanders told supporters at a Friday night rally at the Township Auditorium in Columbia that ""the people have the power in this country.""Rapper Killer Mike said South Carolinians, and particularly black South Carolinians, shouldn't feel pressured to support Mrs. Clinton because others say they should, be it their mother (""Walk past her, walk to the polls"") or their preacher (""Ask him what would Jesus really do."").Mr. Sanders is headed to Minnesota and Texas on Saturday to trumpet his free-college-tuition plan, and he won't be in South Carolina when the election results are announced.Justin Bamberg, one of a handful of black legislators who endorsed Mr. Sanders in South Carolina, said he wishes the Vermont senator could stay for a victory party, but, ""realistically speaking, how can you get everywhere? You can't.""Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist who served as the Southern regional director for Mr. Obama's 2012 campaign, said the reason Mr. Sanders isn't spending as much time in South Carolina as Mrs. Clinton ""is because he now knows you have to develop a broad coalition of support in these Southern states, particularly where there's a high minority voting-age population.""Tad Devine, a senior strategist for the Sanders campaign, said the senator's best hope of winning South Carolina hinged on nabbing victories in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the first three contests.Mr. Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, came close in Iowa and lost Nevada. Absent an early trifecta of wins, Mr. Devine said the Sanders campaign now needs to focus on playing the long game and looking ahead to later contests.""We still believe we have the best message, and while we had the advantage of having Iowa and New Hampshire the first and second states, she has the advantage of having so many states from the South so early in the process,"" Mr. Devine said. ""She'll gain from that. Once that's over, the ball comes back to our court and we start to move into a number of states"" where they expected to do well.But between then and now, Mrs. Clinton is likely to secure lopsided victories that illustrate her ability to attract the diverse coalition necessary for a Democratic candidate to win the general election. She also will rack up a slew of delegates in the process.More in Capital Journal* What to Watch for in South Carolina* Christie Embraces Trump as Billionaire and Rubio Trade Insults* GOP Debate Barrage May Be Too Late for Trump's Rivals* Rubio Presses Attack on 'Con Artist' Trump* IRS: Audit Scenario Claimed by Trump Is 'Rare'* Who's Winning the Delegate Race?* When Losing Presidential Candidates EndorseAlabama state Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison said Mrs. Clinton has a strong following among African-American voters there. The former senator and secretary of state has visited multiple times, and she and former President Bill Clinton will be back in the state on Saturday.African-American voters in Alabama generally have only a vague sense of Mr. Sanders, she said, so the senator's absence in the state ahead of Super Tuesday doesn't help. Some of Mr. Sanders's field organizers visited her office a while back, and she said she told them, ""Quite frankly, I don't really know who he is.""Mr. Sanders's wife, Jane, disputed suggestions that she and her husband haven't spent time in the South or have written off South Carolina or the region, attributing that narrative to what she called Clinton campaign ""spin."" Mr. Sanders appeared at campaign events in the state on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday, she noted.""They spend a lot of time spinning, and so that's not accurate,"" she said. We've gone to Alabama--we were down there for the 50th anniversary of Selma.""This week, though, Mr. Sanders spent most of his time outside of the South, venturing to Massachusetts, Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Oklahoma.Clinton campaign officials also asserted that Mr. Sanders had expended significant resources in South Carolina, hiring a large staff and making major ad buys.""A win in South Carolina for us would be quite meaningful because despite the fact that in recent days Sen. Sanders has focused his travel on Super Tuesday states, it's clear he contested South Carolina very fiercely for a very long time,"" said Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary. ""One could make a judgment that they treated South Carolina as a testing ground for whether they could broaden his appeal and expand his support into a more diverse electorate.""Mr. Fallon said he is confident Mrs. Clinton would emerge from Tuesday's contests with an advantage in pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders has focused the bulk of his recent efforts on five states--Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma--that represent only about one-third of the delegates that will be awarded on Super Tuesday.""If he is not going to contest states that have a greater percentage of African-Americans and Latinos in them, then the math just won't work for him,"" Mr. Fallon said.Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com , Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Valerie Bauerlein and Peter Nicholas",3/2/16

Clinton Works for a Win in South Carolina; Sanders insists his campaign hasn't ceded the state's Democratic primary to his rival,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768059459?accountid=12768,"KINGSTREE, S.C.--Hillary Clinton has been crisscrossing South Carolina, with as many as four events a day, showing diligence in the state and loyalty to its African-American voters who could bolster her chances in Saturday's Democratic primary.In contrast, her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is spending much of his time this week courting college-age voters in Ohio and Oklahoma, an itinerary that could amount to ceding the South and its powerful black voting blocs to Mrs. Clinton. African-American voters will likely make up more than half of the electorate in South Carolina's Democratic primary.Mrs. Clinton's focus has mostly been on criminal justice reform and income inequality. ""We've got work to do to help more people be able to knock down those barriers that stand in their way,"" she said. ""And that includes taking on systemic racism which is still a problem in America.""The Sanders campaign is running an energetic ground game in South Carolina, with hundreds of volunteers knocking on doors, piling into the campaign's half-dozen offices and spending hours a week calling voters.Volunteer Judy Milburn Lake likes to say that ""to see Bernie is to love him,"" and she's disappointed that many South Carolinians haven't had the chance to eyeball Mr. Sanders, who has spent comparatively little time here in the campaign's closing weeks.Ms. Lake, a retired elementary school counselor from Myrtle Beach, said she hopes the volunteer efforts help hold Mrs. Clinton to only a single-digit victory here. ""I think if people would have seen him and talked to him, it would've made a difference,"" Ms. Lake said.The senator from Vermont remains relatively unknown to a lot of voters in this state. And with just a day remaining before the primary, many said they were backing Mrs. Clinton by default.Yvette Duckson, a team leader at the Husqvarna plant in Orangeburg, said she plans to vote for the former secretary of state in part because she doesn't know much about Mr. Sanders.""I think he could have spent a little more time down here if he wanted us to know who he is,"" she said.Mr. Sanders hasn't abandoned the state. He was in Greenville on Sunday and then Columbia on Tuesday for a CNN town hall event. He held a news conference on poverty with two prominent black legislators early Wednesday before setting off to Kansas City, Mo.At the news conference, Mr. Sanders rejected suggestions that he is favoring Super Tuesday states over South Carolina. ""No, no, no, no, no,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""We are fighting here in South Carolina as hard as we can.""Polls show a decided advantage for the former secretary of state. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll last week, Mrs. Clinton held a 28-percentage-point lead over Mr. Sanders among likely Democratic voters in South Carolina.Todd Shaw, associate professor of political science and African-American studies at the University of South Carolina, said Mr. Sanders faces a strategic dilemma this week in dividing his time between South Carolina and the states that will hold the next primaries and caucuses. Although a win appears out of reach in South Carolina, he can't ignore the state ""because that might look as if you're writing off the black vote,"" he said.""He's walking a tightrope here because he needs to demonstrate here that he's taking South Carolina seriously because of the large African-American vote here,"" Mr. Shaw said. ""At the same time, of course he has to keep his eye on the prize of the states that may actually net him a victory or at least a close call.""Mr. Sanders is expected to come back to South Carolina Friday afternoon for two events.On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton had the Palmetto State to herself. And, while Mr. Sanders hopscotched from Ohio to Illinois to Michigan, the entire Clinton family deployed across South Carolina. Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton each had a full day's worth of campaign rallies planned, and daughter Chelsea Clinton appeared at her own event in Charleston.Mr. Sanders is trying to use surrogates to reach voters in his absence. His wife Jane spoke to several dozen Sanders backers at an education forum on Tuesday in Columbia, where she greeted supporters and made the case for free college tuition and educational opportunities for all.An ad with director Spike Lee endorsing ""my brother, Bernie Sanders"" is running on black radio. Actor Danny Glover has been stumping for the Vermont senator in multiple South Carolina cities, telling voters that Bernie Sanders ""belongs to us.""But Sanders supporters privately acknowledge feeling burned when Mr. Sanders said in his Feb. 20 concession speech in Nevada, ""On to Super Tuesday,"" ignoring the primary here that will occur between those two events.""Obviously, Hillary is going to win,"" said Dick Harpootlian, a Sanders supporter and former state Democratic Party chair. ""The question is, 'What's the margin going to be? Does he narrow the margin down enough to be credible with the African-American community?' ""Black voters would be critical to Mr. Sanders's chances in the long run, in the primary trek and the Nov. 8 general election, he said.Clinton fans say they hope South Carolina is the beginning of the end for Mr. Sanders's campaign.Todd Rutherford, the S.C. House Minority Leader, said Mr. Sanders has little support among black voters over age 25. Mr. Rutherford said he tried and failed to find an older black Sanders supporter to participate in a debate. ""They're like unicorns,"" Mr. Rutherford said.Mrs. Clinton's continued presence in the state won over undecided voter Felisa McDavid, an elementary school principal who was among hundreds of members of black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha members at a Wednesday campaign event. Ms. McDavid said she had initially been drawn to Mr. Sanders's focus on income inequality but Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday ""spoke to my heart."" She also said she hadn't seen much of Mr. Sanders: ""I would think that if he does have a good following here, he'd capitalize on that,"" she said.Other Clinton supporters said Mr. Sanders probably was wise to spend much of his time elsewhere this week because he was unlikely to make inroads in the Palmetto State.""It doesn't matter if Bernie Sanders comes to South Carolina,"" said Charmaine Washington, a freshman at Morris College in Sumter. ""I would have voted for Hillary Clinton even if he would have come here.""Write to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.comCredit: By Valerie Bauerlein and Colleen McCain Nelson",3/2/16
Hillary's Drive-By Attack on Guns; Her claim that a 2005 law supported by Sanders gave gun manufacturers 'immunity' is pure fiction.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768057832?accountid=12768,"In a fundraising email Wednesday, Hillary Clinton said that ""families from Sandy Hook are in court suing the manufacturer of the gun that killed their children, challenging the law that gives gun-makers legal immunity. I voted against that law. Senator Sanders voted for it."" The email continued a line of attack that Mrs. Clinton and her surrogates have used for weeks against Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.The law Mrs. Clinton is talking about is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which passed Congress in 2005 with bipartisan support. The onslaught against Mr. Sanders appears to be working: He has announced that he will sponsor legislation to repeal the law he once supported.As someone whose life has focused on tort law, not politics, I feel it is important to correct misconceptions about gun-manufacturer liability.Putting rhetoric aside, this much is clear: Traditional liability law still applies to gun manufacturers. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act specifically states that makers of firearms are liable for any defect in their products, such as if a gun misfires and harms someone, or if it does not work at all and fails at the moment it is lawfully needed.The notion that Congress gave gun manufacturers inappropriate immunity from lawsuits is a fiction. Instead the 2005 law stands for the unremarkable premise that when a business makes or sells a lawful product, but the product is used in an unlawful way, it is not the fault of the maker or seller. It is the fault of the criminal.The law also makes clear that gun manufacturers and sellers can be sued if they did something unlawful that led to the criminal act or injury. The bill does not protect retailers, for instance, if they sell a gun to someone they could have reasonably suspected was going to commit a crime. Nor does the legislation provide cover for anyone who violates laws regarding the sale or marketing of guns. These things are within the manufacturers' or dealers' control.Although some in the gun industry hailed the enactment of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, all it did was clarify existing law. Congress passed the act for the very practical purpose of curbing frivolous and agenda-driven lawsuits. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, some cities and antigun activist sought to subject gun manufacturers to liability for gang violence and other crimes. For instance, in 1998 Chicago sued 18 manufacturers for injunctive relief and over $400 million in damages for alleged harms associated with gun violence.If successful, this litigation would have undermined the long-standing principle of tort law that a manufacturer is not subject to liability when its product is put to an unlawful use by another. The cost of this unfair liability would affect myriad products.About 1,500 murders are committed every year with knives, according to the FBI . But it makes no sense, legally or socially, to hold knife manufacturers responsible for these deaths. Should someone hit by a drunken driver be able to sue the company that manufactured the driver's car? Keep in mind that car makers would pass these costs on to consumers by raising prices for everyone. No matter how carefully a manufacturer designs and builds its products, it is impossible to completely eliminate the possibility for harm at the hands of someone who criminally misuses that product.Nevertheless, abusive lawsuits attempting to expand manufacturers' liability have become common. They are most often filed by a plaintiff or agenda-driven group that wants to regulate an industry but has failed to persuade either Congress or state legislatures. Instead they sue and ask judges to impose their preferences.President Clinton's labor secretary, Robert Reich, labeled these types of lawsuits ""regulation through litigation."" Writing in the American Prospect in 2000, he concluded that federally sponsored lawsuits, such as those against gun and tobacco companies, were ""end runs around the democratic process.""Congress has historically stepped in to stop such abusive litigation and address liability issues of national importance. In 1994 lawmakers approved the General Aviation Revitalization Act to stop lawsuits for design defects against aircraft manufacturers whose planes flew without problems for more than 18 years. The legislation has been viewed by industry groups, legal scholars, and the Government Accountability Office as vital to restoring the industry's viability.In 1998 Congress passed the Biomaterials Assurance Access Act to prevent suppliers of raw materials used in medical devices from being sued for defects in those devices. In 2001 Congress passed the Teacher Protection Act to shield teachers and administrators when they properly follow school procedures in disciplining students. Legislators understood that the classroom should be a place for education, not unfounded litigation.By passing these laws in bipartisan fashion, Congress sent a strong message that unsound liability should not be condoned. That the same principle holds for manufacturers of guns ought to be kept in mind during this contentious campaign season.Mr. Schwartz is chairman of the public-policy group of Shook, Hardy & Bacon LLP in Washington, D.C.Credit: By Victor E.

"Democratic Rivals' Black Outreach Efforts Fall Short in South Carolina; Presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders haven't visited many barber shops, a staple of 2008 race",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767792046?accountid=12768,"COLUMBIA, S.C.--Eight years after Barack Obama's outreach to barber shops and beauty salons helped him secure a decisive win in South Carolina's Democratic primary, many hairstylists and other shop owners in this state say the presidential campaigns don't come calling any more.Barber-shop walls that were once adorned with Obama posters sit bare just a few days before the Saturday primary, and numerous salon owners who became de facto surrogates for the 2008 presidential candidates said they have never been contacted by the Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders campaigns.""Obama's idea to use this barber shop and beauty shop component was really ingenious,"" said Quincy T. Mills, a Vassar College professor who wrote the book ""Cutting Along the Color Line: Black Barbers and Barber Shops in America.""This year, many voters say the Democratic contenders have fallen short in their outreach efforts in African-American neighborhoods, where churches, barber shops and beauty salons are traditional centers of the community. That could be contributing to a decline in interest in the race.Read More* High-Profile Clinton, Sanders Surrogates Battle in South Carolina* Five Percent Growth? Sanders Campaign Defends Disputed Economic AnalysisIn the first quarter of the 2008 campaign, more than 80% of African-Americans said they were very interested in the race that featured the presidential debut of then-Sen. Obama. In 2012, 71% counted themselves as among the most interested voters, the Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls show. In January, just 58% of African-Americans said they were highly interested in the Clinton-Sanders showdown.To be sure, a fair amount of that slide could be tied to the fact that the president isn't on the ballot this year, or on the campaign trail. But these voters and shop owners said neither campaign is pushing hard enough to change that dynamic.Barber Chauncey Harris still keeps his ""Barack Obama '08"" button stashed in his drawer at work, a reminder of the frequent visits Obama volunteers paid to his shop eight years ago.Mr. Harris, a master barber at Next Up Barber & Beauty in Columbia, had planned to support Mrs. Clinton in 2008, but Mr. Obama's campaign won his vote with personal attention ""that made me feel good and changed my mind.""This year, ""nobody came,"" Mr. Harris said. He will cast his vote for Mrs. Clinton on Saturday, but mostly because he likes her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and he said he doesn't know much about Mr. Sanders.As the former secretary of state and the Vermont senator work to win the African-American vote, which is expected to represent more than half of the primary electorate, both campaigns said they are focusing on hair salons and barber shops.The Clinton campaign held an open house at a salon in Orangeburg on Tuesday night, and a Sanders television ad features a barber who is backing him. The Clinton and Sanders teams both have sent some high-profile surrogates, as well as campaign staffers and volunteers, to barber shops to make their pitches.This outreach is ""really important because of the important conversations we have in the barber shops and the beauty shops, especially in the African-American community,"" said Symone Sanders, the senator's national press secretary. ""This is an opportunity to take Sen. Sanders's message right where people are.""But interviews with owners and employees at 10 salons and barber shops, including several that were politically active in 2008, revealed that none had been contacted by either campaign this year.Vassar's Mr. Mills said barber shops have been an influential gathering space in the black community for more than a century. After slavery ended, barbers commonly became local leaders, and their shops became ""a sort of refuge,"" he said. And now, they offer ""a waiting public,"" where people are getting their hair done, waiting their turn or simply sitting there to talk.""Obama understood that because he frequented a black barber shop in Chicago,"" Mr. Mills said. ""So, Obama understood these spaces in a way that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton do not.""Cindy Collins, state president of the century-old black hairdressers' group, the National Beauty Culturists' League, said, ""When you go to the salon, you always talk to your hairdresser. We're like psychologists.""Ms. Collins, who sees some of the same clients she began working with as a ""shampoo girl,"" or apprentice, 35 years ago, still has pictures at Columbia's Salon Chon from a 2008 visit from Erika Alexander, a Clinton surrogate and actress best known for a role on ""The Cosby Show."" Ms. Collins said she has had no calls or visits from the Clinton or Sanders camps this election cycle.Keith Amos, owner of the Sports Talk Barbershop, has a photo of Mr. Obama hanging on the wall behind his chair. But after frequent visits from campaign volunteers in 2008, Mr. Amos, who remains an undecided voter, said he is still waiting to hear from either Democratic campaign this year.""Obama brought the campaign to us,"" he said, adding that he thinks Mrs. Clinton has taken the African-American vote for granted this year.Actor Sean Patrick Thomas, one of the stars of the ""Barbershop"" movies, recently visited more than a dozen Columbia barber shops and salons to make the case for Mrs. Clinton, who holds a commanding lead in national polls among African-American voters.""It's a fantastic spot to reach people within the black community, especially in the South, because we're really into our grooming,"" Mr. Thomas said in an interview. ""You'd be amazed how fast that can spread the word.""The Clinton campaign also worked to build support and mobilize volunteers with a Tuesday night event at Master's Hair Studio in Orangeburg. A band, a buffet and red, white and blue balloons greeted visitors who stopped by the open house. Most of the nearly 50 chairs sat empty, but eventually, 14 people trickled in to hear about Mrs. Clinton's policy proposals.Rick Wade, a prominent South Carolina politician and former Obama administration official, told the audience that Mr. Obama also started with small gatherings at barber shops, and it became ""a movement that changed America.""For its part, Mr. Sanders's campaign is spotlighting in a TV ad Mike Williams, who owns A Cut Above Barber Club in Summerville. Mr. Williams, 30 years old, said he likes everything Mr. Sanders stands for and thinks the senator's policy agenda would be better for his family.While Mr. Williams agreed to appear in the ad, he often keeps his political opinions to himself at work. And Sanders campaign signs and literature are nowhere to be found at his barber shop. ""That's not because I'm not fired up. It's a place of business,"" Mr. Williams said. ""People from all political parties come here, and I don't want to ruffle anybody's feathers.""Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson And Valerie Bauerlein",3/2/16

Perhaps readers will nominate others. But for now let's savor a rare advance for economic growth and innovation from the Obama White House.As for Tuesday, the news wasn't as good.

""It's not going to happen--at least not if Mr. Obama follows the law,"" notes a Journal editorial .

Bad Math for Cruz and Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767412916?accountid=12768,"The two most important numbers to emerge from last Saturday's contests are 22 and 27.The former is the percentage of the African-American vote Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received in losing Nevada's Democratic caucuses by six points to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. By contrast, according to the entrance polls, Mr. Sanders split the white vote with Mrs. Clinton.This leaves Mr. Sanders with a large strategic challenge. While African-Americans made up only 13% of caucus-goers in Nevada, they are likely to form more than half of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina on Saturday.Following a timely endorsement from South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in the House of Representatives, this crucial bloc of voters appears poised to deliver a solid majority to Mrs. Clinton. And African-Americans make up a substantial share of the Democratic base throughout the South, including 51% in Alabama and Georgia and 48% in Louisiana. Latinos make up about 30% of the Democratic primary vote in Texas and California. But in the other contests between now and mid-March, their share is certain to be much lower.Surprisingly, Mr. Sanders was not able to garner strong majorities among groups where he was expected to do well. Despite his class-based program and strong ideological appeal, he could gain no better than an even split with Mrs. Clinton among caucus-goers without college degrees and with incomes under $50,000. Even among caucus-goers who regard themselves as ""very liberal,"" he won by a narrow margin of 52% to 47%, not nearly enough to counterbalance Mrs. Clinton's 22-point edge among self-styled moderates.Voters who want policies more liberal than President Obama's went for Mr. Sanders by 77% to 21%, compared with the 75% to 22% edge Mrs. Clinton received from voters who want to continue on Mr. Obama's course. Unfortunately for Mr. Sanders, the ""let us continue"" faction of the party outnumbered its ""to the left, march"" counterpart by nine percentage points.Unless these dynamics change dramatically in the next few days, the vote in South Carolina, where Mrs. Clinton currently enjoys a double-digit advantage, should restore her standing as the strong front-runner for her party's presidential nomination.The second crucial number--27--is the percentage of the evangelical vote Texas Sen. Ted Cruz received in South Carolina. This result goes to the heart of Mr. Cruz's meticulously scripted strategy for winning his party's nomination by establishing a dominant position among evangelicals as well as committed conservatives.Mr. Cruz did reasonably well among very conservative primary voters, receiving 35%, ahead of Donald Trump's 29% and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 19%. But among evangelical voters, Mr. Cruz lost to Mr. Trump by six points while gaining only a modest advantage over Mr. Rubio. He also lost evangelicals to Mr. Trump in New Hampshire.If this pattern of weak evangelical support continues, it is hard to see Mr. Cruz's path to victory, because his sharply etched profile limits his appeal outside his base. In South Carolina, for example, only 17% of ""somewhat conservative"" voters and 7% of moderates supported him, and his showing among nonevangelical voters was a meager 13%.And despite his outsider stance since arriving in Washington, he lost to Mr. Trump by a staggering 50 points, 63% to 13%, among the 48% of South Carolina Republicans who want a president from outside the establishment. Even if Mr. Cruz prevails in Texas on March 1, the rationale for his candidacy has been weakened, perhaps fatally.Although Ohio Gov. John Kasich has run a strong, positive campaign, gaining many admirers along the way, he is almost certainly too moderate--at least as conservatism has been redefined during the past two decades--to gain a plurality of his party's base.A Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday suggests that Mr. Kasich will be hard-pressed to prevail against Mr. Trump even in his home state of Ohio, where he was re-elected as governor with 64% of the vote in November 2014.If lifelong Republicans are to block Mr. Trump's hostile takeover of their party, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's withdrawal from the race leaves them with only one realistic option: Marco Rubio. The question is whether they can coalesce around him in time to stop Mr. Trump, and whether they are willing to undertake the no-holds-barred effort needed to unmask him. We will soon learn if Republican leaders will mount a real fight or meekly surrender.A surprising number of Republicans have told me privately, and some are now saying publicly, that they cannot support Mr. Trump as their party's nominee. Last week, William Kristol, the editor of the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, floated the possibility of backing an independent conservative candidacy. This would not be the strangest thing to happen in a very strange election year.Credit: By William A. Galston",3/2/16
Setback in Nevada Slows Sanders's Stride; Coming contests will test the Vermont senator's efforts to broaden his coalition,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766920931?accountid=12768,"GREENVILLE, S.C.--Bernie Sanders faces a narrow path to the Democratic presidential nomination after a defeat in the Nevada caucuses blunted his momentum and highlighted the steep challenge of broadening his coalition.Hillary Clinton won Nevada by 5 percentage points Saturday, but her victory was arguably bigger than that, coming as the Vermont senator was building his case as a credible challenger. The former secretary of state now has claimed victory in two of the first three contests, and is favored to win Saturday's South Carolina primary. Mr. Sanders, who walloped her in the New Hampshire primary, won't see his next best chance for a victory until March 1, when 11 states host primaries and caucuses.Mrs. Clinton's Nevada win settled her nervous backers, just as the race shifts to the South, long considered to be her firewall, primarily because of her strong support from African-American voters. Mr. Sanders spent Sunday in South Carolina, but already appears to be pivoting to the next round of primaries with nearly 900 delegates up for grabs.""We're going to be competing in 11 states all across this country [March 1] on Super Tuesday,"" Mr. Sanders said after conceding Nevada. ""And I believe that on Super Tuesday, we have got an excellent chance to win many of those states.""On Sunday, Mr. Sanders said he isn't skipping over South Carolina, but after holding a rally in Greenville, S.C., Sunday night, the Vermont senator will head to Massachusetts for a rally on Monday and then to Virginia on Tuesday. In Greenville, where Mr. Sanders was introduced by actor Danny Glover, he drew a crowd of more than 5,000.Mrs. Clinton plans to hold events in South Carolina on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Clinton campaign also began airing an ad narrated by actor Morgan Freeman in South Carolina, and it plans to deploy civil-rights attorneys and mothers who lost children to gun violence across the state to make the case for her candidacy.The March 1 terrain offers Mr. Sanders some opportunities. His campaign is running TV ads in Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma and Massachusetts, states where it sees its best chance for victory. Minnesota and Colorado are caucus states, which tend to attract the more liberal voters that he appeals to, his advisers said. He also holds a huge advantage in his home state of Vermont.But also voting the same day are Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Arkansas, all contests that will feature significant numbers of African-American voters. That should provide an advantage to Mrs. Clinton, whose support in the black community was reaffirmed in Nevada, where entrance polls showed three-fourths of African-Americans backed her. She's expected to see similar support in South Carolina.Sanders aides have said for months that the campaign must expand its support base and find ways to appeal to black voters. On Sunday, he spoke at a black church in Columbia, S.C.But Nevada's results revealed little progress overall, and Mr. Sanders said his rival's advantage with African-American voters there was a concern. ""We did badly with the African-American vote,"" Mr. Sanders told CNN on Sunday. ""But I think the more the African-American community hears our message...I think you're going to see us making progress there as well.""One open question is Mrs. Clinton's advantage with Latino voters, who are a key part of the electorate in places including Texas, another March 1 state. Entrance polls showed Mr. Sanders winning this group, but the Clinton campaign questioned that finding given the overall results.After Super Tuesday, the Sanders campaign sees potential victories on March 5 in Kansas and Nebraska and on March 6 in Maine--all three caucus states. Sanders aides are also focused on the big prize of Michigan, where a primary is set for March 8. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver also noted that under Democratic Party rules, delegates are allocated proportionately, meaning that if a race is close, both candidates win substantial delegates.There are no winner-take-all states in the Democratic primary race, which prevents one candidate from pulling far away from a competitor. At the same time, though, this system makes it very hard to catch up once a candidate falls behind.When challengers are forced to drop out, it is usually because they run out of money, and Mr. Sanders shows no signs of that. He collected more than $6 million in the 24 hours after winning the New Hampshire primary, though campaign finance reports show he also dramatically increased his spending in January. On Saturday, the Vermont senator asked his backers to continue to lend their financial support, saying that ""taking on the establishment"" isn't easy.Still, he'll need to notch some quick wins if he is to seriously threaten Mrs. Clinton. ""He has the money and resources to keep going, but he needed Nevada to fuel his momentum because he will lose South Carolina,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist who is neutral in the race.""Realistically, this hill became very high to climb,"" Mr. Kofinis said. ""Short of a stunning loss [by Mrs. Clinton] on Super Tuesday, we're seeing the limits of his candidacy.""While Nevada delivered a much-needed win to the former secretary of state, potentially slowing Mr. Sanders's rise and settling uneasy Clinton supporters, her campaign officials say the Vermont senator remains a strong candidate.""He is a real force,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton's communications director. ""We're grateful for this win, but we know we've got 47 more states.""Mrs. Clinton has introduced new themes in her basic stump speech that seem partly a reaction to the challenge posed by Mr. Sanders. For months, she talked up detailed proposals aimed at helping middle-class families meet expenses--policies that were within the mainstream of Democratic politics, but far less sweeping than those of Mr. Sanders.In her victory speech in Nevada and continuing at a rally late Saturday night in Houston, Mrs. Clinton made the point that government's role isn't simply to reward Americans with lavish programs. ""This can't be just about what we're going to give you,"" she told the crowd at Texas Southern University. ""It has to be about what we will build together.""Peter Nicholas contributed to this articleWrite to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",3/2/16
Hillary Clinton's Win Slows Bernie Sanders's Momentum; Her victory in the Nevada Democratic caucuses gives a boost as the campaign moves to states in the South,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766822470?accountid=12768,"Vote totals don't give the full measure of Hillary Clinton's victory in Nevada . In winning Saturday's caucuses, Mrs. Clinton has slowed the momentum of Sen. Bernie Sanders at a critical point, as he was threatening to build credibility as a national candidate.That shift is more important than the margin of victory. Mr. Sanders' campaign has been fueled by ardent, liberal supporters drawn by his call for a political revolution' against the wealthy and Wall Street. Had he built on his sweeping New Hampshire victory with a second win, Mr. Sanders could have made a stronger case for acceptance among the broader Democratic electorate and threatened to erase the many advantages Mrs. Clinton brings to the campaign.Instead, Mrs. Clinton has now won two of the first three nominating contests just as the race turns next week to favorable terrain in South Carolina, where African-American voters make up a majority of the state's Democratic voting pool. Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders by 50 percentage points among African-American--73% to 23%--in a national Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of Democratic primary voters released this week.The states that follow South Carolina will be equally difficult places for Mr. Sanders to regain momentum. The March 1 Super Tuesday states include others with large African-American populations and ideologically moderate voters, among them Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia. Together, they offer far more delegates than do liberal Massachusetts and Vermont, where Mr. Sanders is likely to do well.Mr. Sanders' campaign had started as a quixotic endeavor but had lately become a true threat. He gained 1 million campaign donations faster than any candidate in history, eroding Mrs. Clinton's presumed fundraising edge. Mr. Sanders outraised the Clinton campaign in January, a substantial surprise, given the donor network that Mrs. Clinton and her husband have tended for decades.A second advantage for Mrs. Clinton--her lead among the party's superdelegates--was starting to come under stress. Superdelegates are elected officials and other Democratic Party insiders who can vote for any candidate they wish at the national nominating convention.As the voice of the party establishment, Mrs. Clinton had already secured support from about half the superdelegates, Associated Press reporting found. But liberal groups and others in the party had started to argue that these party insiders should endorse whoever wins the popular vote, rather than throw the nomination to Mrs. Clinton, for example, should Mr. Sanders outpoll her.Nevada appears to have blunted the threat. Results from the state also suggest that Mrs. Clinton has stabilized her coalition of supporters. Women, who are essential to her campaign, favored her by 16 percentage points, according to preliminary results from surveys of caucus-goers, which were reported by media outlets. That marks a substantial change from the New Hampshire primary, in which she lost women by 11 points.Less clear is how Mrs. Clinton fared among Hispanic voters, as preliminary survey results suggested that Mr. Sanders had carried that group. That result, if it held, would mean little in South Carolina, where Hispanic voters accounted for a mere 1% of voters in the last competitive Democratic primary, in 2008. But it could allow Mr. Sanders to win delegates in the big, Super Tuesday state of Texas.Still, the Nevada results leave Mr. Sanders with the big task he has had to navigate from the start: How to broaden a coalition of young, liberal supporters to become a force in the broader party--especially given Mrs. Clinton's eagerness to try to head him off by tacking to the left on policy, herself.Credit: By Aaron Zitner",3/2/16
Hillary Clinton Wins Nevada Democratic Caucuses; Former secretary of state narrowly defeats Sen. Bernie Sanders in third contest of the 2016 presidential race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766818071?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS, Nev.--Hillary Clinton beat back a stiff challenge from rival Bernie Sanders on Saturday, winning a close race in Nevada's Democratic presidential caucuses.""I am so so thrilled and so grateful to all of my supporters out there,"" she said at a victory rally. ""Some may have doubted us but we never doubted each other.""With 81% of precincts reporting, Mrs. Clinton had a 52.1% lead compared with 47.8% for the Vermont senator.The victory was a major relief for the Clinton campaign and allows the former secretary of state to move on to contests in South Carolina next Saturday and the states that follow with fresh momentum after being walloped in New Hampshire and winning by only the slimmest of margins in Iowa.Mrs. Clinton had long been considered the favorite in Nevada. But Mr. Sanders' 22-point victory margin in New Hampshire gave him significant momentum. An infusion of donations also allowed him to put staff on the ground and television ads on the air.Mr. Sanders said in a statement that he had called to congratulate Mrs. Clinton. ""I am very proud of the campaign we ran. Five weeks ago we were 25 points behind and we ended up in a very close election. And we probably will leave Nevada with a solid share of the delegates,"" Sanders said in a statement.""I am also proud of the fact that we have brought many working people and young people into the political process and believe that we have the wind at our back as we head toward Super Tuesday. I want to thank the people of Nevada for their support that they have given us and the boost that their support will give us as we go forward,"" Sanders said.In the hours before the caucuses started, Mrs. Clinton visited the Harrah's employee cafeteria in Las Vegas late Saturday morning about 20 minutes after Mr. Sanders passed through the same room. ""Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!"" the room cheered as she entered.Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was nearby at the Caesars Palace hotel on the Las Vegas strip. ""We're doing everything we can,"" he said. ""We got a good response.""Las Vegas hotel workers, many in uniform, swarmed a Democratic caucus site in a Caesars Palace ballroom, one of six at-large caucus locations in the city aimed at making it easier for shift workers to take part in the contest.Waiting to get into the ballroom, Michael Jaumotte, a food service worker at Caesars, said he was backing Mr. Sanders. ""I like that he's not taking donations from big corporations,"" he said. A group of housekeepers from the Bellagio Hotel arrived together wearing their brown uniforms and ""Hillary"" stickers.Walking into his polling precinct at a middle school in Henderson, Nev., Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he would vote uncommitted, to stay neutral in the race. ""Everyone knows the caucus setup here in Nevada are my doing,"" said Mr. Reid, who was instrumental in moving the Nevada caucuses to the forefront of the nominating process.""I want to make sure that Clinton and Sanders know that I've been fair. If I got involved on one side or another, it would be easy for them to say, you know he's trying to affect the caucuses unfairly,"" he said, adding that he would offer an endorsement after the caucuses are over.Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders made a point of spending at least part of their time in the days before the caucuses in the mountains and deserts of Nevada, away from the glam and glitter of Las Vegas.Mr. Sanders spent Friday stumping in Elko and Reno before returning to Las Vegas for a large rally. Mrs. Clinton made stops in both Reno and Elko earlier in the week.State caucus rules give rural counties outsize weight in the delegate-allocation process, a directive aimed at ensuring candidates don't just campaign in the cities.Consequently, the road to victory in Saturday's Democratic caucuses runs through places like Elko, a small mining community that is the closest thing to a major city in northeast Nevada, and Pahrump, a desert town of about 36,000 that boasts a handful of casinos, a couple of brothels--and Clinton and Sanders campaign field offices.And both campaigns worked these sparsely populated communities, phoning supporters daily and driving to remote houses on dirt roads that aren't on the maps to knock on doors and see if the people who answer might need a lift to caucus sites.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 news.* Immigration Set to Stay Center Stage in Primaries* Trump Leaves Trade Mark on GOP* Nevada Union's Silence Clouds Caucus* South Carolina's Clyburn Endorses Clinton* Pope Francis and Trump Spar Over Immigration and Candidate's Faith* South Carolina GOP Stalwarts Fear Primary Will Only Underscore Party Rifts* Clinton's Lead Shrinks as More Women Shift to Sanders, WSJ/NBC News Poll Finds* Critics See Racial Subtext in Obama-Rubio Photo MashupMr. Sanders brought his pitch to Elko on Friday, a picturesque mountain town of 20,000 people that lies more than 300 miles north of Las Vegas in a conservative part of the state. He was following Mrs. Clinton, who flew in earlier in the week. Republican candidates, who hold their caucuses Tuesday, were expected to start arriving in northern Nevada over the next few days.But the Vermont senator finished up his Nevada campaign late Friday in Henderson , Nev., the second largest city in the state. He didn't predict victory in his speech, but instead forecast Saturday as a key date in his hopes for the presidency.""It could well be that 10, 20, 30 years from now people will look back on what happens in Nevada and say this was the beginning of the political revolution,"" Mr. Sanders said.Though the overwhelming majority of the state's people live in and around Las Vegas, campaigns ignore the rural areas at their own peril. In the 2008 Democratic race between Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama, she won the state but Mr. Obama collected more delegates in part because of a stronger organization and presence in the rural areas.""She won the popular vote, but she did not win the caucus because caucuses are based on delegates,"" said Joan Kato, a former aide to Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign who now serves as the state director for Mr. Sanders. Nevada has 23 delegates up for grabs in this year's caucuses.That was a mistake her campaign didn't plan to repeat. She has offices in Elko, Pahrump and Carson City, and organizers across the state. Mr. Sanders has 12 field offices, though his campaign started organizing in Nevada months after Mrs. Clinton arrived.The Clinton campaign says its staffers logged 1,250 miles across rural Nevada last summer, sending senior campaign leaders into communities like Ely, Winnemucca, Hawthorne and Tonopah for a listening tour that helped shape the campaign's rural strategy.Bill Clinton also visited Pahrump this month and spoke to a few hundred people at a local elementary school.Gabe Alvare, a 24-year-old Clinton volunteer visiting from New York City, spent hours knocking on doors of known supporters on Wednesday in Pahrump, making sure they planned to show up for the caucus. He had stopped at many of the same houses a few days earlier. He offered Clinton yard signs, but there were no takers. Nye County is predominantly Republican, and some of the people seemed reluctant to post a yard sign that might antagonize neighbors.At the wheel of the GMC pickup truck in which Mr. Alvare traveled was Clinton supporter Frank Dix, 73, who lives in Pahrump and feels a special loyalty to the Clinton family.""I'm partial to strong women,"" Mr. Dix said. ""Hillary dealt with Bill. That's what my wife says about me. She says, 'I had to be strong, because otherwise Frank would run all over me.' ""Navigating can be a challenge. The recession hit Pahrump hard, and construction on some roads seemed to stop before completion.""We go where the houses are, not where the roads are,"" Mr. Dix said.There is no surefire way to get people to turn up at the caucus sites. One person mentioned that softball practice posed a potential conflict. A woman said her husband was planning to go, but he hasn't been feeling good lately.There have been some reassuring moments for Messrs. Alvare and Dix. Helaine Jennings, a 69-year-old retiree, answered her door and said she was all-in for Mrs. Clinton. When Mr. Alvare asked if she needed a ride, she declined. ""We have two legs,"" she said. ""It's very close.""At a spartan office nearby, the Sanders campaign was working to get out the vote. Rick Bandell, a 75-year-old retiree, said he was thrilled to call one home and persuade an entire family to show up in support of Mr. Sanders.""I got four people in one call,"" he said. ""They're going to caucus for Bernie. It's very unusual. I'd be happy to just to get one.""Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nye County, which includes Pahrump, by about 3 to 2, and the GOP complexion of the town is evident. At Mom's Diner, next to the Clinton campaign office, 10 Pahrump supporters of GOP candidate Ted Cruz were meeting for lunch and plotting strategy.What was also clear was that people of Pahrump were dialed in to the race.At the Lakeside Casino and RV Park, 63-year-old Leanette Robertson paused from her video-poker game to discuss the Sanders-Clinton contest. She favors Mrs. Clinton but wasn't sure she would be able to go to the caucuses because she had family visiting.""She's got a broad spectrum of issues she's supporting,"" Ms. Robertson said of Mrs. Clinton. ""It's not just the money issue. Bernie seems to be focused on one issue: the 1% of the 1%.""Reid J.

Republican candidates, who hold their caucuses Tuesday, were expected to start arriving in northern Nevada over the next few days.But the Vermont senator finished up his Nevada campaign late Friday in Henderson , Nev., the second largest city in the state. He didn't predict victory in his speech, but instead forecast Saturday as a key date in his hopes for the presidency.""It could well be that 10, 20, 30 years from now people will look back on what happens in Nevada and say this was the beginning of the political revolution,"" Mr. Sanders said.Though the overwhelming majority of the state's people live in and around Las Vegas, campaigns ignore the rural areas at their own peril. In the 2008 Democratic race between Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama, she won the state but Mr. Obama collected more delegates in part because of a stronger organization and presence in the rural areas.""She won the popular vote, but she did not win the caucus because caucuses are based on delegates,"" said Joan Kato, a former aide to Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign who now serves as the state director for Mr. Sanders. Nevada has 23 delegates up for grabs in this year's caucuses.That was a mistake her campaign didn't plan to repeat. She has offices in Elko, Pahrump and Carson City, and organizers across the state. Mr. Sanders has 12 field offices, though his campaign started organizing in Nevada months after Mrs. Clinton arrived.The Clinton campaign says its staffers logged 1,250 miles across rural Nevada last summer, sending senior campaign leaders into communities like Ely, Winnemucca, Hawthorne and Tonopah for a listening tour that helped shape the campaign's rural strategy.Bill Clinton also visited Pahrump this month and spoke to a few hundred people at a local elementary school.Gabe Alvare, a 24-year-old Clinton volunteer visiting from New York City, spent hours knocking on doors of known supporters on Wednesday in Pahrump, making sure they planned to show up for the caucus. He had stopped at many of the same houses a few days earlier. He offered Clinton yard signs, but there were no takers. Nye County is predominantly Republican, and some of the people seemed reluctant to post a yard sign that might antagonize neighbors.At the wheel of the GMC pickup truck in which Mr. Alvare traveled was Clinton supporter Frank Dix, 73, who lives in Pahrump and feels a special loyalty to the Clinton family.""I'm partial to strong women,"" Mr. Dix said. ""Hillary dealt with Bill. That's what my wife says about me. She says, 'I had to be strong, because otherwise Frank would run all over me.' ""Navigating can be a challenge. The recession hit Pahrump hard, and construction on some roads seemed to stop before completion.""We go where the houses are, not where the roads are,"" Mr. Dix said.There is no surefire way to get people to turn up at the caucus sites. One person mentioned that softball practice posed a potential conflict. A woman said her husband was planning to go, but he hasn't been feeling good lately.There have been some reassuring moments for Messrs. Alvare and Dix. Helaine Jennings, a 69-year-old retiree, answered her door and said she was all-in for Mrs. Clinton. When Mr. Alvare asked if she needed a ride, she declined. ""We have two legs,"" she said. ""It's very close.""At a spartan office nearby, the Sanders campaign was also working to get out the vote. Volunteers were making calls and planning a mock caucus session so attendees would know what to expect on Saturday.Rick Bandell, a 75-year-old retiree, said he was thrilled to call one home and persuade an entire family to show up in support of Mr. Sanders.""I got four people in one call,"" he said. ""They're going to caucus for Bernie. It's very unusual. I'd be happy to just to get one.""Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nye County, which includes Pahrump, by about 3 to 2, and the GOP complexion of the town is evident. At Mom's Diner, next to the Clinton campaign office, 10 Pahrump supporters of GOP candidate Ted Cruz were meeting for lunch and plotting strategy.What was also clear was that people of Pahrump were dialed in to the race.At the Lakeside Casino and RV Park, 63-year-old Leanette Robertson paused from her video-poker game to discuss the Sanders-Clinton contest. She favors Mrs. Clinton but wasn't sure she would be able to go to the caucuses because she had family visiting.""She's got a broad spectrum of issues she's supporting,"" Ms. Robertson said of Mrs. Clinton. ""It's not just the money issue. Bernie seems to be focused on one issue: the 1% of the 1%.""Reid J. Epstein contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau",3/2/16
"Hillary Clinton's Lead Shrinks as More Women Shift to Bernie Sanders, WSJ/NBC News Poll Finds; Sanders cut Clinton's once-commanding national lead in Democratic race by more than half, poll finds",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766173639?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders has cut Hillary Clinton's once-commanding national lead in the Democratic primary race by more than half over the last month, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds.Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, drew support from 53% of people who expect to vote in Democratic primaries, while 42% picked Mr. Sanders. That 11-point spread is much closer than the 25-point advantage Mrs. Clinton enjoyed a month ago, when the poll found her ahead by 59% to 34%.The new poll found that Mrs. Clinton holds a solid but diminished lead among her core group of supporters: women. She continues to dominate among minorities, a crucial voting bloc in coming contests in Nevada and the South.""The race is tightening,'' said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who helped conduct the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. At the same time, he said, Mrs. Clinton retains ""structural advantages...that put her in a competitive position to be the Democratic nominee.""The poll points to a long-term challenge for Mrs. Clinton in the continued rise of negative feelings about her among the broader electorate. Half of the people surveyed said they felt negatively about her, a record high for her. More than half said they would feel uncertain or pessimistic if she won the White House.Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster who helped conduct the survey, said that Mrs. Clinton's biggest obstacle in 2016 isn't Mr. Sanders, but her own difficulty in winning the trust and affection of voters.""She is running against herself,"" Mr. Hart said. ""When it comes to competence, temperament...she laps the field. Voters just need to like her.""The poll, conducted Feb. 14-16, signaled continuing progress for Mr. Sanders in the aftermath of voting in Iowa, where Mrs. Clinton barely eked out a victory, and in New Hampshire, where the Vermont senator won decisively.Mr. Sanders's gains over the past month were due in large part to rising support among younger women. Mrs. Clinton remains ahead among women overall, but Mr. Sanders slashed her lead by 19 percentage points, to 58%-39%. Mr. Sanders leads among women under age 50, while Mrs. Clinton holds a far larger lead among those 50 and older.A bigger challenge for Mr. Sanders has been his underperformance among minority voters. He made some gains among nonwhite voters in the new poll, but Mrs. Clinton still leads among those voters by 29 percentage points, 62% to 33%. In January, she had led by 42 points.More Democratic voters express reservations about Mr. Sanders's key weaknesses than about Mrs. Clinton's. About one quarter said they were concerned about his lack of foreign policy experience, and 23% said his policy proposals were out of the mainstream.Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street--a central line of attack by Mr. Sanders--were a concern to 22% of Democratic voters. Questions about Mrs. Clinton's honesty and judgment related to her use of a private email server while in the government were of little consequence within the party: Only 7% of Democratic primary voters said they were concerned about it.Mr. Sanders is winning over change-oriented young women such as LaurrenNirider, 25, a poll participant in Richland, Wash.""I'm 100% behind having a woman president. But I'm not going to support someone just because she's a woman,"" said Ms. Nirider, who backs Mr. Sanders. ""Compared to Hillary Clinton, he's going to be able to move the country in a more forward direction. He's rattling the cages a little more.""Nancy D. Pemberton, 65, a college teacher in Tryon, N.C., said she thought Mr. Sanders was too inexperienced and his policies unrealistic. She saw Mrs. Clinton as better equipped for the office.More on Election 2016* In Poll, Bloomberg Prospects Look Dim* Additional 2016 Election Polls* Bill Clinton Charges Where Campaign Hesitates* Pope Calls Trump 'Not Christian' on Immigration* Ted Cruz Overtakes Donald Trump in Latest Republican Presidential Poll* Americans Divided on Considering Obama High Court Nominee* Democrats Vie for Nevada's Minorities""She can get the job done, and that is the most compelling thing that I am looking at,"" said Ms. Pemberton. ""It couldn't hurt to have a woman in there.""The poll asked voters of both parties to consider hypothetical candidate matchups and found that Mr. Sanders, at least for now, seemed better equipped than Mrs. Clinton to beat a GOP opponent in the fall.Mr. Sanders outpolled businessman Donald Trump by 16 points--53% to 37%--and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas by 50% to 40%.Mrs. Clinton also beat Mr. Trump in a one-on-one matchup, 50% to 40%, but only tied Mr. Cruz, 46% to 46%.Mr. Hart warned, however, that such polls this early in a campaign are poor predictors of general election matchups when a candidate is as little known as Mr. Sanders.Gauging the public's attention to the campaign, the poll found that Democratic voters show less interest in the election than do Republicans. Asked to rate their interest on a scale of one to 10, 77% of Democratic primary voters rated themselves a nine or 10, compared with 87% of Republican primary voters.If the election came to a Clinton-Trump face-off, many voters would see the choice as between two unfavorable options. Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Trump, 50% to 40%, among registered voters. But only 34% said their vote would be a sign of support for their chosen candidate, while 47% said it would be a signal that they didn't want the other candidate to be elected.Asked whether they viewed the candidates in a favorable or unfavorable light, voters had sharply negative views of three candidates: Mrs. Clinton and Messrs. Cruz and Trump. Some 59% of voters viewed Mr. Trump negatively.Views of only two candidates--Mr. Sanders and Ohio Gov. John Kasich--were more positive than negative.None of the candidates in either party inspired great confidence in voters: Asked how they would feel if each were elected president, no candidate sparked more than 21% of voters to say they would feel ""optimistic and confident.""Mr. Yang, the Democratic pollster, said the 2016 campaign ""seems to be shaping up as a race to the bottom, with the more likely dynamic being why the other person shouldn't be president.""Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.comCredit: By Janet Hook",3/2/16

After Tuesday's voting, her lead among delegates chosen by voters grew to nearly 200, a bigger margin than Mr. Obama ever enjoyed in his protracted 2008 battle for the presidential nomination against Mrs. Clinton.""Over the upcoming weeks, we intend to steadily add to Hillary Clinton's already sizable lead in delegates, and as we do, it will become harder and harder mathematically for Sen. Sanders to ever catch up,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in a ""state of the race"" memo.After Tuesday's voting, Mrs. Clinton was assured of at least 581 pledged delegates, who are chosen by voters, with Mr. Sanders claiming at least 388. The Mook memo contrasts Mr. Sanders's biggest win in his home state of Vermont, where he netted 16 delegates, to Mrs. Clinton's biggest victory of the night, in Texas, where she took 78.Mrs. Clinton also has a huge lead among super delegates, party leaders who can vote for anyone. When those are included, her total tops 1,000, almost halfway to the number needed to clinch the nomination.Tad Devine, a senior strategist for Mr. Sanders, said their campaign would make up ground as the race shifts to states with more favorable demographics. Mrs. Clinton's blow-out wins across the South were built on strong support from African-American voters, whereas coming states have larger share of white voters, who support Mr. Sanders in greater numbers.However, after losing the white vote in Nevada, Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday rebounded, capturing 57% of the white vote in Virginia and essentially tying with Mr. Sanders among white voters in Massachusetts. She also won the Democratic white vote in Tennessee and Georgia.Mr. Devine also floated another, seemingly long-shot path to victory. He said that under Democratic Party rules, pledged delegates aren't required to support the candidate they were chosen to represent. He said they are only required to reflect the sentiment of the voters, which he said could change if Mrs. Clinton doesn't ""win consistently"" through the campaign.Mr. Sanders's next opportunity comes this weekend with caucuses in Nebraska, and Kansas, as well as Maine. He is also targeting Michigan's primary on Tuesday.""We have to win a lot of places, beginning this weekend, and that's what we intend to do,"" Mr. Devine said.Mr. Mook wrote that Mr. Sanders may win in the weekend's caucuses, but said Mrs. Clinton will more than make up any deficit with a victory in Louisiana, which votes Saturday. If Mr. Sanders wins in Michigan on Tuesday, Mr. Mook said, Mrs. Clinton will offset that with a bigger win in Mississippi, whose primary is the same day.""The end result is that Sen. Sanders will spend millions of dollars in Michigan but not make any net gain in pledged delegates because he isn't competing in states like Mississippi,"" Mr. Mook predicted.But if the race was all but over, it wasn't obvious in Maine, where a line of Sanders supporters snaked for blocks along downtown streets in near-freezing weather waiting to crowd into a local theater to hear him speak.""The states that are coming up are lot more favorable than some of the ones on Super Tuesday. and he has a really good shot,"" said Evan O'Day-Senior, 30 years old.The crowd numbered 2,400, though almost all the faces were white, a sign that Mr. Sanders is still struggling to expand his coalition despite his campaign's promises, repeated on Wednesday, to do just that.Given Mrs. Clinton's advantage, some Democrats were itching for Mr. Sanders to tone down his attacks.""If his goal is to simply deliver a message, he should think twice before criticizing the likely nominee who is on the verge of entering what promises to be a brutal general election campaign that will require Democrats to be unified,"" said Democratic strategist Ben Labolt, a former Obama aide.Sanders aides explicitly rejected any suggestion that he is a ""message candidate,"" and the senator showed no signs of toning down his criticism.In Portland, he cited a trio of speeches Mrs. Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for $225,000 apiece and renewed his call that she release the transcripts. She has said she will do so when all candidates, including Republicans, do the same with their paid speeches.""I urge Secretary Clinton to share that extraordinary speech with the American people,"" Mr. Sanders said.

A Big Push for Flawed Front-Runners; Bernie could cause trouble for Hillary at the convention. And Trump is no 'unifier.',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769834693?accountid=12768,"Super Tuesday was a huge day for the Democratic and Republican Party front-runners. Both took big steps toward winning their respective nominations--but even as they piled up delegates, they still face challenges.Hillary Clinton swept seven of the night's 11 Democratic contests, winning 61.4% of the day's vote. She started that morning with 91 delegates from February's contests and ended the evening at 581. This doesn't include her support from so-called superdelegates--elected politicians and various Democratic Party pooh-bahs who are automatically entitled to vote for any candidate they want at the national convention.Bernie Sanders raised $42 million in February--and did it the easy way. Mrs. Clinton must trudge across the country to fundraisers, soliciting $2,700 a donor. Sen. Sanders need only send an email or tweet to get $30 each from millions of Americans.But money alone won't sway the Democratic contest. Leading among the 712 superdelegates by 457 to 22, Mrs. Clinton will be the nominee unless she or someone close to her is indicted over her private email server. Still, Mr. Sanders's fundraising shows the Democratic Party's left-wing grass roots are unlikely to roll over anytime soon for the former secretary of state.So what does Bernie want? He will arrive at the Philadelphia convention in July with a chunk of delegates and authentic enthusiasm. He doesn't seem to be angling for the vice-presidency. Instead, he appears to be a true believer who wants to kill the superdelegate process and demand explicitly democratic-socialist platform planks on income inequality and government regulation. These could be troublesome for Team Clinton.Donald Trump also had much to celebrate. The Republican front-runner started the day with 82 delegates and, by carrying seven of the 11 Republican contests, has added 237 to bring his total to 319 of the 728 chosen so far.Mr. Trump took 2.9 million of the 8.5 million votes cast, roughly 34.4%. Sen. Ted Cruz garnered 2.5 million votes, 29.3%. Sen. Marco Rubio got 1.9 million, votes, 22%. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Dr. Ben Carson and the other 14 candidates trailed with 1.2 million votes, 14.4%.In other words, almost two of three Republicans are still not voting for the celebrity hotelier. He is winning--but not yet winning like a candidate who has consolidated his lead and unified the party.Mr. Trump's performance on Super Tuesday is similar to how he did in February, when he carried contests with 34.2% of the nearly 1.3 million votes cast, compared with 20.7% for Mr. Cruz, 20% for Mr. Rubio and 16% for the other 14 candidates.The good news for Mr. Trump is that his opposition remains divided and GOP rules help increase his share of delegates in states like Texas and Vermont, where Mr. Rubio failed to reach the statewide 20% required to win delegates. Mr. Trump's support also tends to be more uniform, allowing him to run first in more congressional districts where even a 35%-40% plurality gives him two of the three district delegates.From listening to their victory statements this week, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump seem aware of their challenges. In her third successive election-night teleprompter speech, Mrs. Clinton mimicked Mr. Sanders's angry left-wing populism. She denounced disloyal corporate executives who move businesses abroad ""to avoid paying their fair share of taxes,"" and asked what original Tea Party patriots would say about ""student loan companies that overcharge young people.""Mrs. Clinton also aimed her speech at the general election, suggesting that if Democrats aren't enthusiastic about her, they should remember ""the stakes in this election have never been higher. And the rhetoric we're hearing on the other side has never been lower.""Mr. Trump wisely eschewed his normal election night rants and offered (for him) a relatively high-toned, shrewd presentation, saying the idea of a conservative third party would only help Mrs. Clinton. And he claimed, ""I'm a unifier.""Right now that's a wish, not reality. Mr. Trump's campaign has left the GOP riven and embittered. Even on Tuesday, in his heal-the-breach approach, he mocked one challenger (""little Marco Rubio"") and brushed off pro-lifers critical of his support for Planned Parenthood by calling them ""so-called conservatives."" In Trump World this may qualify as unifying, but not anywhere else.Both candidates are deeply flawed--but also front-runners. Unless something dramatic and unexpected happens, they also appear likely to be their respective parties' nominees.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the 1896 Election Still Matters"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",3/3/16
Sanders Plans for the Long Run; The Vermont senator may face increasingly long odds but is determined to collect delegates and rally progressives,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769102136?accountid=12768,"No matter the results from Super Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to fight on for the Democratic presidential nomination, with opportunities for victory this weekend and plenty of money to fuel a long battle with front-runner Hillary Clinton.The Sanders campaign has targets throughout the spring but he faces long odds overall. Still, he appears determined to continue, at a minimum, rallying progressives and picking up delegates where he can, even if Mrs. Clinton mounts a steady march to the nomination.And even if he loses, Sanders aides and allies say he has already won. He's succeeded in pushing the issues he cares most about to the center of the debate. He's pushed Mrs. Clinton to the left on several points. And he is sure to emerge from this contest with strength at this summer's Democratic National Convention and as a higher-profile figure in the national debate.""The Clinton campaign is going to want it to be over, and the Democratic establishment is going to want the race to be over,"" said Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders's chief strategist. ""The voters don't want it to be over.""The Vermont senator has also proved that it's possible to fund a presidential run on small donations. Mr. Sanders raised more than $42 million in February alone, his highest monthly haul. That gives him plenty of money to move forward.Mrs. Clinton was poised to emerge from Tuesday's voting with a growing lead in the delegate race, but Democratic rules award delegates proportionally, meaning both candidates are likely to win a healthy slice even in states that they lose.Mr. Sanders reminded his supporters of these rules in a speech celebrating victory in his home state of Vermont early Tuesday evening.""Tonight you're going to see a lot of election results come in, and let me remind you of what the media often forgets about. This is not a general election. It's not winner take all,"" he said. ""If you get 52%, you get 48%, you roughly end up with same amount of delegates in a state. By the end of tonight we are going to win many hundreds of delegates.""Ahead of the results, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, emphasized that the process was designed to be drawn out.""We're going to accumulate a lot of delegates and we're going to go forward. This campaign is going all the way to the convention,"" he said in an interview Tuesday. ""As long as you can fund your campaign, the process continues.""But while the delegate system makes it hard for the leader to put a challenger away, it also makes it hard for someone who falls behind to catch up.""At a certain point it does become mathematically difficult or worse to catch up, and he has to decide--does he stay in to keep pushing a message and frame the debate, or does he get out to try and unify the party and help be a part of the preparations for the general election?"" said Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and a former Clinton aide.Mr. Sanders also may reason that if Mrs. Clinton stumbles, he would be able to benefit.Sanders aides say his next chances for a good showing will come this weekend with caucuses in Kansas and Nebraska on Saturday and, particularly, in Maine on Sunday. All three states are largely white, and he's done much better with white voters than he has with minorities. Caucuses also tend to attract the most liberal, motivated voters, which could give him an edge.Also voting Saturday is Louisiana, where half the Democratic primary voters were African-American in 2008, giving Mrs. Clinton an advantage that could offset Sanders gains elsewhere.After that, the Sanders campaign foresees a ""showdown"" in Michigan, which hosts a Clinton-Sanders debate on Sunday and its Democratic primary on Tuesday.Mr. Weaver said Mrs. Clinton's past support for certain trade deals, and kind words early on for the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership, would be a major issue in Michigan, an industrial state that has suffered from free trade and globalization.But the former secretary of state will enter Michigan with advantages of her own. She has given extraordinary attention to the water crisis in Flint, where a cost-cutting move wound up poisoning the water supply with lead. Mr. Sanders has also spoken out on the issue, but public polls show Mrs. Clinton with a double-digit lead in the state.Also voting next Tuesday will be Mississippi, another Southern state rich with African-American voters and expected to be a Clinton stronghold. If Mr. Sanders does manage to win in Michigan, Mrs. Clinton will probably counter with Mississippi.Mr. Devine acknowledged his candidate will have to improve his standing with African-American voters in order to win the nomination.""We're going to work hard at it,"" he said. Mr. Sanders and his aides have been making similar vows for months and he is still struggling to win African-American support.The Sanders campaign faces a tough challenge in Florida's March 15 primary. With a dozen media markets, it is an expensive state for TV ads, and state rules don't let independents--who tend to favor Mr. Sanders--participate.The race is likely to stretch through the spring, Mr. Devine said. He sees possible victories on the West coast in late April and early May, and he said Mr. Sanders also may make a play for New York, a delegate-rich state that votes April 19.But even if Mr. Sanders doesn't win the nomination, supporters say he achieved more than anyone predicted when he entered the race last summer as an asterisk in the polls.""You'll see more and more candidates learning to talk like Sanders,"" predicted Robert Borosage, co-director of the liberal group Campaign for America's Future.In the intervening months, Mrs. Clinton has come out against a trade deal she once appeared to support, and has embraced a $12 federal minimum wage, which is less than the $15 minimum that Mr. Sanders backs but still a significant increase. She's also put forth major spending programs to subsidize college costs and rebuild infrastructure.And either way, Mr. Sanders is likely to remain a major figure on the national stage.""He is serious about creating this political revolution and that means mobilizing tens of millions of people across America,"" Mr. Weaver said. ""The political revolution goes on. It's bigger than just Bernie Sanders and this campaign.""Credit: By Laura Meckler",3/3/16
"Hillary Clinton Dominates Super Tuesday Races; Mrs. Clinton wins in Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia; Bernie Sanders takes Vermont, Oklahoma",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769071096?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton won sweeping primary victories in Texas and throughout the South on Super Tuesday, a sign that the Democratic presidential front-runner was vaulting to a commanding lead in the race for the nomination and leaving rival Bernie Sanders diminishing space to stage a comeback .Mr. Sanders captured his home state of Vermont and Oklahoma . But Mrs. Clinton easily won the delegate-rich Southern states ofVirginia , Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee and Arkansas , as well as Texas , the Associated Press projected--a testament to the continued loyalty of African-American voters who are a sizable share of the Democratic electorate.""What a Super Tuesday!"" Mrs. Clinton said in celebration from Florida, during a speech that touched on general-election themes. In an unmistakable reference to the slogan of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who was having his own strong night, she said, ""America has never stopped being great. We have to make America whole.""Mrs. Clinton easily won in Virginia, an important battleground in the general election. With more than 80% of precincts counted, she had nearly 65% of the vote, versus about 35% for Mr. Sanders, according to the Associated Press.In another general-election battleground, Colorado, caucuses were just convening as results from the eastern half of the nation rolled in Tuesday night. A line of voters snaked through the hallway of Denver North High School in the city's Highland neighborhood.""A lot of people here know what she is capable of and know she is capable of leading the country,"" said Linda Garcia, who caucused for Mrs. Clinton at Denver North.But Sanders supporters said they hoped their candidate could press forward. ""I hope he has a chance. It's always tough for somebody who is preaching a lot of change to come up against the big money,"" said Steve Eagleburger, a supporter of Mr. Sanders. ""I guess we'll see after tonight.""Read More in Capital Journal* LIVE BLOG: Super Tuesday Results* Trump Piles Up Wins on Super Tuesday* Sanders Plans for the Long Run* Clinton's Embrace Of Party Establishment Contrasts With Republican Candidates* Exit Polls Show Wider Partisan Divide in Super Tuesday Presidential VotingThe tight race in Massachusetts was also being closely watched. The outcome in the solidly Democratic state could foreshadow the direction of a party that has been divided between Mr. Sanders's idealism and Mrs. Clinton's pragmatism.Mr. Sanders, a senator who addressed supporters in Vermont shortly after polls closed there, appeared to be preparing his backers for a disappointing night. He explained that even with a loss, his campaign would win delegates under the party's allocation rules, and he emphasized the long road ahead.""At the end of tonight, 15 states will have voted; 35 states remain,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""And let me assure you that we are going to take our fight for economic justice, for social justice, for environmental sanity, for a world of peace, to every one of those states.""Coming into Super Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton was a heavy favorite to expand her delegate lead over her rival and perhaps take a daunting lead for the Democratic nomination. Such an outcome, which would make Mrs. Clinton the prohibitive favorite. Mr. Sanders's role would be reframed as an important voice on the left, rather than a threat.At stake were 878 pledged delegates to the summer convention, the biggest single-day prize in the Democratic race and more than one-third of the 2,383 delegates needed to capture the nomination. Eleven states were in play, plus American Samoa and a contingent of Democrats living abroad.Midway through the evening, Mrs. Clinton had added 314 delegates, giving her 405 pledged delegates, which are awarded by voters. In addition, she has support of 457 superdelegates, who can vote for anyone they choose, according to a tally by the Associated Press.Mr. Sanders had added 122 delegates, giving him 187, plus 22 superdelegates.Exit polls across the Super Tuesday map pointed to a widening ideological divide for the nation. The results indicated more Democrats were characterizing themselves as liberal, and fewer calling themselves moderates.Mr. Sanders came into Super Tuesday after a 48-point loss in South Carolina last Saturday, his second defeat in a row. The loss pointed to a structural weakness in his campaign: difficulty making inroads with African-American voters who have yet to warm in large numbers to his message about income inequality and the unfairness of the campaign-finance system.Though Mr. Sanders is flush with campaign money, his advisers decided not to air TV ads in some of the Super Tuesday states with large minority populations, given his low odds of prevailing there. The Sanders campaign focused his TV advertising instead on other Super Tuesday states that looked more promising, including Colorado, Minnesota, Virginia and Oklahoma.Mr. Sanders needed to put some wins on the board and undercut perceptions that his rival was the inevitable nominee. His easy win in Vermont was expected; he won re-election in 2012 with 71% of the vote.With 57% of the Oklahoma vote counted, Mr. Sanders had 52% compared with 40% for Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders also invested heavily in Minnesota and Colorado, visiting both states repeatedly. Mr. Sanders drew 18,000 people in a rally in Denver last month and thousands more at a rally at Colorado State University on Sunday.Still, the senator's challenge has been converting that enthusiasm into votes.Turnout on the Democratic side has flagged compared with the 2008 election, when Mrs. Clinton ran against then-Sen. Barack Obama. In the New Hampshire primary last month, Democratic turnout was 13% lower than in 2008, and in South Carolina, it was 31% lower.That could present a challenge to Democrats in the general election, as turnout in the raucous Republican primaries has been higher.With Mrs. Clinton buoyed by back-to-back wins since Mr. Sanders's win in New Hampshire, the Vermont senator faced the challenge of persuading voters that he could still prevail. That has proved a tough sell in certain quarters.Dan Frosch contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",3/3/16

Bernie Sanders talking up his longtime opposition to free trade agreements and Hillary Clinton's campaign promising policies that would support job creation.Mr. Sanders, looking for a win in the industrial heartland, repeated his claim that Mrs. Clinton had supported ""disastrous"" trade agreements and suggested that her opposition to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership wasn't sincere.The former secretary of state plans to respond in a speech at an auto supplier in Detroit on Friday. Advisers said that Mrs. Clinton would propose ways to create jobs by boosting manufacturing, and that she was willing to back trade agreements only if they met her standards.""The answer can't be to shut down all trade,"" said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton's senior policy adviser. He said the key is backing ""smart and fair trade, where American workers get a level playing field with the rest of the world.""The candidates have been debating these points for months, but the issues are taking on new urgency with the approach of Tuesday's primary in Michigan, a state long reliant on manufacturing that has suffered steep job losses.The issue is sure to be litigated when Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton debate on Sunday in Flint, Mich.Mr. Sanders is banking on a win in Michigan for fresh momentum after losing seven of the 11 states that voted on Tuesday and falling well behind in the delegate count. His top aides refer to the Michigan contest as a ""showdown"" that will influence the course of the race.On Thursday, Mr. Sanders fired the first salvo. At a news conference here, surrounded by union workers, he said he had consistently opposed trade deals and suggested that Mrs. Clinton can't be trusted to stop them if elected president.Mr. Sanders said that trade agreements such as Nafta, signed by Mrs. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, have eliminated jobs in the U.S. as corporations have moved operations to countries that pay lower wages.Read More in Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Clinton Wins Leave Diminished Room for a Comeback by Sanders* Capital Journal: After Super Tuesday, Republicans Face Moment of Truth* After Three Super Tuesday Wins, Ted Cruz Sees a Two-Horse Race* Recap: Super TuesdayHe rattled off various trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton backed and that he had opposed. ""On the issue of trade, Secretary Clinton's views and mine are very different,"" Mr. Sanders said.He also pointed to Mrs. Clinton's original kind words for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation deal that is one of the Obama administration's key priorities. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton called it the ""gold standard,"" but she came out against it once it was completed in October, six months into her presidential campaign.""She was very reluctant to come out in opposition,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""She is running for president. She concluded it was a good idea to oppose the TPP, and she did.""The Sanders campaign also is airing a TV ad in Michigan that says Mr. Sanders has been steadfast in opposing trade deals ""while others waffle.""Mrs. Clinton has said she evaluates trade agreements on a case-by-case basis, supporting some but not others. As a senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton opposed a Central American Free Trade Agreement but supported deals with Australia, Singapore and several other nations.Mr. Sullivan didn't answer directly when asked whether, if elected president, Mrs. Clinton would try to make changes to the Asian deal to get it approved. He said that she believes ""we need to have a very serious conversation about the future of trade."" He said that should include how to prevent a ""race to the bottom"" among trading partners, and that Mrs. Clinton wants a ""hard think"" about what it would take to construct trade agreements that raise working standards.Clinton aides said that in her Friday speech, she would present a broad vision for bolstering U.S. jobs. Mr. Sullivan said she would lay out a ""new bargain for a new economy"" that extends to coal country and cities such as Detroit.She has already laid out several small-scale proposals for bolstering manufacturing, including tax breaks to encourage investment in hard-hit areas and better enforcement of trade agreements.Mr. Sullivan charged that Mr. Sanders didn't have a manufacturing plan of his own, and said he was wrong to oppose reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which provides financing to support some major domestic manufacturers. On that issue, Mr. Sanders aligned with conservatives in opposing what he called ""corporate welfare to multinational corporations.""The Clinton campaign also called in backing from Michigan's Sen. Debbie Stabenow. The senator said that Mrs. Clinton ""totally gets it"" when it comes to manufacturing and jobs. ""You don't have an economy, you don't have a middle class, unless somebody makes something,"" she said.Credit: By Laura Meckler and Peter Nicholas",3/4/16
"Bernie Sanders's Plan Would Raise Taxes by 34%, Analysis Finds; Candidate concentrates increases on high-income households, but every bracket would pay more",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770463313?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders's tax plan is just as revolutionary as he promises--raising federal tax revenue by 34% and cutting the after-tax incomes of the wealthiest households nearly in half, according to an analysis released Friday.Mr. Sanders's plan, designed to pay for a significant expansion of government spending, is the largest and most dramatic of all the presidential candidates' and the least likely to find support from either party in Congress. That is saying something in a year when Republicans are proposing unprecedentedly large tax cuts and structural changes.Mr. Sanders's proposals would increase federal taxes by $15.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. Mr. Sanders concentrates his tax increases on high-income households, which would face sharply higher levies on their wages, business income, capital gains and estates, as well as more limits on their deductions. The top 0.1%--those with incomes of $3.7 million under an expanded definition--would pay an average federal tax rate of 63.7% in 2017, up from 34.2%.The middle 20% of households would face an average tax increase of $4,692 in 2017 and lose 8.5% of after-tax income. The lowest-income households would lose, too, but they would come out even by 2025.""Sanders is clearly betting that people are willing to pay for his expansive new welfare state,"" said Leonard Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, who was a Treasury Department official under President Bill Clinton. ""There's a giant tax increase, mostly on the rich, but everyone would pay more.""In a statement released late Friday, the campaign said the analysis was wrong and incomplete because it didn't include the benefits Americans would get from Mr. Sanders's proposals for single-payer health care, expanded Social Security benefits, free public college tuition and better U.S. infrastructure.""The Tax Policy Center chose to analyze Sanders's tax plan in a vacuum without taking into account the savings the American people would gain under his Medicare-for-all plan. That is misleading,"" said Warren Gunnels, the campaign's policy director. ""Without estimating the benefits American people would gain under these initiatives, the Tax Policy Center's report is inaccurate and one-sided.""The top effective marginal tax rate on wages would increase to 64.2% from 43.1%, and Mr. Sanders would raise the top rate on capital gains to 62% from 24.1%, while making it harder for wealthy individuals to defer or avoid capital gains taxes. He also would limit U.S. companies' ability to defer U.S. taxes on their foreign income, impose new taxes on financial transactions and create a new tax on carbon, with a rebate for consumers.New payroll taxes on employers and on all workers would pay for what Mr. Sanders calls Medicare for all and for paid family leave. The $15.3 trillion estimate appears to leave Mr. Sanders several trillion dollars short of paying for his promises, and that is assuming the tax increases don't inhibit economic growth.The center said Mr. Sanders's tax plan ""would substantially reduce incentives to save and invest in the U.S."" and would discourage lower-earning spouses from entering the workforce.Mr. Sanders's plan stands in contrast with that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. She proposes raising taxes on high-income households to pay for new spending and is offering targeted tax breaks and a forthcoming tax cut for middle-income households. For every $1 she is proposing to raise in taxes, Mr. Sanders wants to raise $14.24.""Her experience in government and in politics for a long time tells her that those are the kinds of things she could get done. Bernie Sanders clearly wants to change things radically,"" Mr. Burman said.The center has now completed its estimates of the tax plans of the five leading presidential candidates--the two Democrats, along with Republicans Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. The center hasn't analyzed Republican John Kasich's plans because it lacks sufficient detail. In the general election, Mr. Burman said, the center will attempt to analyze the economic effect of tax changes along with the combined effect of tax and spending proposals.The center is a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, and it used a bipartisan panel of reviewers to examine the Sanders plan.Its economists are generally skeptical of the idea that tax changes can prompt major economic responses. But Mr. Sanders's plan is so big that it might be different, the report said.""The proposed tax changes on both labor and capital income are very large compared with any tax policy changes since World War II, so the empirical evidence of relatively small effects cited earlier may not apply,"" the report said. ""The lack of prior historical experience for changes of this magnitude makes the macroeconomic effects of Sanders's plan especially uncertain, but there is a risk that the very large tax increases could significantly weaken the U.S. economy.""Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comCredit: By Richard Rubin",3/5/16

"Hillary Clinton's New Gambit: Auto Bailout vs. Wall Street Ties; Pressed on financial-industry ties, Clinton attacks Democratic rival Bernie Sanders for refusing to back bailout package that helped car industry",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770809024?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--After long playing defense over her close ties to Wall Street, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton tried to shift the terms of the argument Sunday night, using the stage of a debate in Michigan to blast her challenger for opposing financial-industry bailout funds that were also used to keep afloat the auto industry in 2009.The former secretary of state's paid speeches to, and contributions from, the financial industry were once again a prominent issue in her seventh debate with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, taking up about 10 minutes of the two-hour session Sunday night in Flint, Mich. Most of the back-and-forth covered well-trodden ground.But Mrs. Clinton added a new twist, attacking Mr. Sanders for refusing to back the federal government's $700 billion bailout package, which was originally intended for financial institutions but ended up also giving a lifeline to the struggling domestic car industry.""If everybody voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed,"" said Mrs. Clinton. She called her opponent a ""one-issue candidate"" who failed to make the difficult choice of saving four million middle class jobs and saving the industry that dominates the economy of Michigan, which holds its primary contest Tuesday.More on Election 2016* Flint Democratic Presidential Debate--Recap* Democrats Eye Next Fights* Clinton, Sanders Head Into Seventh Democratic Primary Debate* Clinton's Louisiana Win Helps Offset Two Caucus Defeats* Trump Leads Rivals in Michigan, Trails Clinton in General Election Test, Poll Finds* Flint Begins Replacing Lead Pipes* 2016 Election PollsMr. Sanders defended his decision to vote against the auto bailout, saying he was opposing federal funds to the financial industry. ""I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street,"" he said.This is the first of two Democratic debates this week. The candidates are scheduled to meet again on Wednesday night in Miami, ahead of the March 15 Florida primary.Unlike with the Republican candidates, Wall Street regulation has been one of the key issues dominating the Democratic contest, with Mr. Sanders repeatedly charging that Mrs. Clinton has taken too much money from the financial sector in speaking fees and campaign contributions to be able to police the industry effectively.Defending her Wall Street donations once again Sunday night, Mrs. Clinton repeated her response that President Barack Obama accepted significant contributions from Wall Street and then and passed the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act imposing strict new restrictions on the financial industry.Mr. Sanders yet again pressured Mrs. Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other Wall Street firms. She gave a trio of speeches to Goldman for $225,000 apiece.Mrs. Clinton said she will do so when all candidates, including Republicans, do the same with their paid speeches.""I'll be happy to release as long as everybody does else, too,"" said Mrs. Clinton.The U.S. government intervened in January 2009 to bail out General Motors Co. and what was then called Chrysler Group LLC, in a move intended to avert a collapse of the two automakers and prevent the loss of millions of jobs.Congress voted to release $350 billion to aid automakers as part of the Treasury Department's $700 billion bailout fund intended for the financial industry.Credit: By Donna Borak",3/7/16
Hillary Clinton's Louisiana Win Helps Offset Two Caucus Defeats; Democratic rival Bernie Sanders wins contests in Kansas and Nebraska,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770560414?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders rebounded from a string of tough defeats with victories in Kansas and Nebraska on Saturday, but he lost to front-runner Hillary Clinton in Louisiana , a split decision that is unlikely to erode her commanding lead in delegates.As in previous contests, Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, prevailed in states that are predominantly white, while Mrs. Clinton dominated in a Southern state where African-Americans account for a substantial share of Democratic voters.Mr. Sanders was winning Nebraska 55% to 45% with about 80% of precincts reporting, according to the Associated Press, and he won the Kansas vote by 68% to 32%. In Louisiana, Mrs. Clinton had nearly 70% of the vote to 24% for Mr. Sanders, with 90% of precincts reporting""We have the momentum,"" Mr. Sanders said in a statement released after the Kansas Democratic Party announced he had won. ""We have a path toward victory. Our campaign is just getting started and we are going all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.""What he doesn't have are the delegates--or at least enough of them.Heading into Saturday's contests, Mrs. Clinton held a lead of 604 to 408 in pledged delegates. She also has the support of 458 ""superdelegates""--party leaders and officials free to back the candidate of their choosing. Mr. Sanders has the backing of 22 superdelegates. A candidate needs 2,383 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination.Because delegates are awarded proportionally based on results, it is difficult for a trailing candidate to leapfrog ahead.Recognizing that dynamic, Brad Woodhouse, president of a pro-Clinton super PAC called Correct the Record, said in a statement: ""With today's results, Hillary Clinton cemented her delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. While Sanders may claim a win or two, anyone looking at the delegate count can see the truth: his odds of taking the nomination are next to nil.""This past Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton won seven states concentrated in the South, piling up a lead of nearly 200 pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders won his home state of Vermont and also Oklahoma, Minnesota and Colorado.At an earlier point in the race, such an outcome would have been seen as a triumph for Mr. Sanders, a 74-year-old self-described democratic socialist who started off the race a heavy underdog. But his narrow defeat in Iowa on Feb. 1, followed by his 22-point victory in New Hampshire the following week, raised expectations that he could go toe-to-toe with Mrs. Clinton.Having survived the early scare, the Clinton family seems palpably relieved. Campaigning in Nebraska on the eve of the caucuses, Bill Clinton barely mentioned Mr. Sanders.""We've just been through an amazing stretch that has totally changed this race in the Democratic primary,"" the former president said at a rally in Omaha on Friday. He added: ""It's been a challenging time because the Republicans have spent the last three-plus years trying to take her down. They're basically pleading, 'Please, don't make us run against her!' ""The trio of states holding contests Saturday underscored how difficult it is for Mr. Sanders to mount a comeback. His campaign targeted Kansas and Nebraska, airing TV ads in both states. Together, those states offer a total of 58 delegates--just seven more than Louisiana, where in the 2008 Democratic primary, about half of Democratic voters were African-American. Mr. Sanders's campaign ran radio spots in Louisiana but stayed off TV, an aide said.The Clinton campaign is now making the case that she has already amassed a daunting delegate advantage.Her aides sent out an email Saturday morning reiterating the point that her delegate lead over Mr. Sanders exceeds the lead that Barack Obama held over her at any point in the hard-fought 2008 Democratic primary.Dismissing that argument, the Sanders campaign said it is trailing because the Democratic primary calendar was ""front-loaded""--filled with early contests in states friendly to Mrs. Clinton.Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, said the Vermont senator expects to do well in any number of states that come later on, including Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii later this month, and Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania in April.""There are still so many states to come,"" Mr. Weaver said. ""If the states at the back of the calendar were instead at the front, we'd be having a very different conversation now.""Three more contests will be held over the next three days: Maine on Sunday, followed by Michigan and Mississippi on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders sees Michigan as an important prize, and he has campaigned hard in the state.Hoping to endear himself to voters who have seen their manufacturing base suffer, Mr. Sanders has trumpeted his opposition to free-trade agreements and cast Mrs. Clinton as an unreliable ally of working-class families that have lost jobs to international trade pacts.Mrs. Clinton, too, has poured time and money into Michigan. She has made the water crisis in Flint a rallying cry of her candidacy, insisting that the Democratic debate Sunday take place in Flint to showcase the city's troubles.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",3/7/16
How Progressives Drive Income Inequality; The Obama years proved that transfer payments reduce incentives to work and lower incomes. Yet Clinton and Sanders are eager to go the same route.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770448253?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are promising all types of programs to make America a more equal country. That's no surprise. But when you look at performance and not rhetoric, the administrations of political progressives have made the distribution of income more unequal than their adversaries, who supposedly favor the wealthy.The Census Bureau releases annual updates on income distribution in the U.S., publishing three technical statistical measures--the Gini index, the mean logarithmic deviation of income (mean log deviation for short), and the Theil index--each of which represents inequality levels on a scale of 0 to 1 (zero signifies perfect equality and 1 indicates perfect inequality). By all three measures, inequality rose more under Bill Clinton than under Ronald Reagan. And it wasn't even close. While the inequality increase as measured by the Gini index was only slightly more during Clinton's two terms, the Theil index and mean log deviation increased two and three times as much, respectively.Barack Obama's administration follows this pattern, despite the complaints he and his supporters have made about his predecessor. The mean log deviation increased 37% more under Mr. Obama than under President George W. Bush, although when this statistic was released, Mr. Obama had only six years as president compared with Mr. Bush's eight. The Gini index rose more than three times as much under Mr. Obama than under Mr. Bush. The Theil index increased sharply during the Obama administration, while it fell slightly under Bush 43.Sure, no president intends to raise inequality. And the spin doctors for Messrs. Clinton and Obama may insist that it wasn't their fault.But consider their policies. Both Democratic presidents presided over bubble economies fueled by easy monetary policy. There is no better way to make the rich richer than to run policies that push up the price of financial assets. Cheap money is a boon to those who have access to it. Interest rates were also too low under Bush 43, but that bubble was in housing, and the effects were therefore more evenly distributed than under Mr. Clinton's stock-market bubble or Mr. Obama's credit bubble.Money matters, but so do other policies, such as the long, historic sweep of the expanding welfare state. In 1968, government transfer payments totaled $53 billion or roughly 7% of personal income. By 2014, these had climbed to $2.5 trillion--about 17% of personal income. Despite the redistribution of a sixth of all income, inequality measured by all three of the Census Bureau's indexes is far higher today than in 1968.Transfer payments under Mr. Obama increased by $560 billion. By contrast private-sector wages and salaries grew by $1.1 trillion. So for every $2 in extra wages, about $1 was paid out in extra transfer payments--lowering the relative reward to work. Forty-five million people received food stamps in mid-2015, an increase of 46% since the end of 2008. Similarly, 71.6 million individuals were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, an increase of 13.3 million since October 2013.In 2008, during the deepest recession in 75 years, 13.2% of Americans lived below the government's official poverty line. The Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, but in 2014, after five years of economic expansion, 14.8% of Americans were still in poverty. The economy was better, and there were a lot more handouts, but still poverty rose.The structure of American households shows how this happened. From 2008 through 2014, the most recent year for which we have data, the number of two-earner households declined. These two-earner households have become the backbone of the American middle class.Research by the Hamilton Project and the Urban Institute show that when families with children making between $20,000 and $50,000 attempt to have a second earner go back to work, the effective tax rate on the extra earnings--including lost government benefits such as food stamps, the earned-income tax credit, and medical support payments--is between 50% and 80%. This phaseout of the ever increasing array of benefits has created a ""working-class trap"" instead of a ""poverty trap"" that is increasing inequality and keeping the income of these households lower than they might otherwise be.While the number of two-earner households declined during the first six years of the Obama presidency, the number of single-earner households rose by 2.6 million and the number of households with no earners rose by almost five million. In other words, two thirds of the increase in the number of families under Mr. Obama was accounted for by households with no one working. This is the reason the middle class has shrunk, and the reason inequality has increased. And unless we increase the number of people wanting to work and the number of jobs through economic growth, inequality will only increase.The flip side of the progressive agenda to redistribute income to those with less is to raise taxes on the ""rich."" The data show that it is also an ineffective way to reduce inequality.President Clinton increased the top tax rate on higher earners--yet inequality rose during his administration, and faster than under the tax-cutting Ronald Reagan. The same happened under President Obama. Tax rates went up on upper-income earners. Inequality rose too, and more than under his tax-cutting predecessor.A recent Brookings Institution study--whose authors include Peter Orszag, President Obama's director of the Office of Management and Budget--found that boosting the top tax rates even more, as Sen. Sanders suggests, would have little or no effect on inequality. The paper explored the effects of raising the highest marginal income-tax rate to 50% from 39.6%. Assuming no behavioral effects, the expected revenue was then distributed directly (and in theory costlessly) to the bottom 20% of income earners.The $95 billion in extra taxes and transfers reduced the Gini Coefficient by only 0.003. To put that in perspective, that reversed only one fifth of the increase in inequality during the Obama presidency.There was a catch. When the authors assumed that there might be a behavioral response by higher income taxpayers, inequality fell--but for the wrong reasons. Less work, saving, investing and more tax sheltering reduced the taxable income of higher earners and therefore meant less revenue to redistribute. So the rich got poorer, by their own choice, but the poor got less in benefits. A true lose-lose situation.None of this should really be surprising. If the socialist ideal of ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" worked in practice, the Berlin Wall might still be standing. Of course, one of the reasons it came down is that a new ruling class emerged to take from the productive and give to those in need, siphoning off a cut of the swag along the way. Ruling classes always have sticky fingers.Redistribution through the political process is not costless--even in a perfect world there would be a large bureaucracy to feed. Special-interest elites also emerge when so much money is being moved around. They take their cut, introducing even more inefficiency into the system.Presidential contenders who boast of their plans to reduce inequality might ponder the fact that providing more free things is not the answer. Even free college and free health care are paid with taxes that discourage people from increasing their work, savings and entrepreneurship.Attacking the rich and running against inequality may be a sensible political strategy. But in the end the programs to implement this strategy make the problem worse. Yet advocates come back and demand the same programs. That is perilously close to the definition of insanity attributed to Einstein: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.The repeated failure of political promises has another downside--increasing voter alienation and cynicism. The appeal of redistribution is understandable, but voters who think the progressives running today are going to reduce inequality are falling into the same trap as people entering fifth or sixth marriages--the triumph of hope over experience.Mr. Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor and assistant to President George W. Bush for economic policy, is president and CEO of the Lindsey Group. He is the author of ""Conspiracies of the Ruling Class,"" out on March 8 from Simon & Schuster.Credit: By Lawrence B.

Hillary Clinton Triumphs in Delegate-Rich Super Tuesday States; Front-runner's wins leaves Bernie Sanders diminished room for a comeback,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769265464?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton won sweeping primary victories in Texas and throughout the South on Tuesday, a sign that the Democratic front-runner was vaulting to a commanding lead in the race for the presidential nomination--and leaving rival Bernie Sanders diminishing space to stage a comeback.The former senator and secretary of state easily won the delegate-rich states of Virginia , Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee and Arkansas , as well as Texas , propelled by African-American and other minority voters who are a sizable share of the Democratic electorate in those states.She also took a narrow victory over Mr. Sanders in Massachusetts , another state with a delegate bonanza. With that win, Mrs. Clinton showed she could take a state traditionally in the party's liberal wing from Mr. Sanders--and one that is next door to his home state of Vermont.Mr. Sanders won primaries in Vermont and Oklahoma as well as caucuses in Colorado and Minnesota .""What a super Tuesday!"" Mrs. Clinton said in celebration from Florida, during a speech that touched on general-election themes. In an unmistakable reference to the slogan of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who was having his own strong night, she said, ""America has never stopped being great. We have to make America whole.""Mrs. Clinton's dominant performance on the biggest day of the primary season amounted to a decisive resurgence for a candidate who lost one bid for the presidency in 2008 after being the early favorite.This time around, initially favored to win everywhere, Mrs. Clinton captured Iowa on Feb. 1 by the barest of margins over Mr. Sanders, then lost New Hampshire by 22 points the next week. That slow start prompted consternation by some Democrats, casting her as a flawed candidate who they said had yet to lay out a compelling rationale for being president.But Mrs. Clinton retooled her message over the past few weeks, speaking in more personal terms about the need to break down barriers that keep all Americans from advancing. Those changes paid off Tuesday, and with the nomination now in sight, she began to look ahead to a possible showdown with Mr. Trump.""Instead of building walls, we're going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment so every American can live up to his or her potential,"" Mrs. Clinton told cheering supporters in Miami, referring to the wall Mr. Trump has promised to build between the U.S. and Mexico. ""Because then and only then can America live up to its full potential.""Mrs. Clinton's margins of victory Tuesday ranged from about 30 percentage points in Virginia--an important battleground in the general election--to 60 points in Alabama.In another general-election battleground, Colorado, won by Mr. Sanders, a line of voters snaked through the hallway of Denver North High School in the city's Highland neighborhood.""A lot of people here know what she is capable of and know she is capable of leading the country,"" said Linda Garcia, who caucused for Mrs. Clinton at Denver North.But Sanders supporters said they wished their candidate could press forward. ""I hope he has a chance. It's always tough for somebody who is preaching a lot of change to come up against the big money,"" said Steve Eagleburger, a supporter of Mr. Sanders. ""I guess we'll see after tonight.""The race in Massachusetts, won by Mrs. Clinton with just over 50% of the vote, was also being closely watched. The outcome in the solidly Democratic state could foreshadow the direction of a party that has been divided between Mr. Sanders's idealism and Mrs. Clinton's pragmatism.Read More in Capital Journal* Clinton, Trump Turn Super Tuesday Into Delegate Hauls* CAPITAL JOURNAL: After Super Tuesday, Republicans Face Moment of Truth* SEIB VIDEO: Is Trump's Momentum Unstoppable After Super Tuesday Wins?* Donald Trump Notches More Wins, but Ted Cruz's Victories Promise Long Race* After Two Wins, Ted Cruz Sees a Two-Horse Race* Republican Divide About Trump Grows* Sanders Plans for the Long Run* Clinton's Embrace Of Party Establishment Contrasts With Republican Candidates* Exit Polls Show Wider Partisan Divide in Super Tuesday Presidential VotingMr. Sanders, addressing supporters in Vermont shortly after polls closed there, appeared to be preparing his backers for a disappointing night. He explained that even with a loss, his campaign would win delegates under the party's allocation rules, and he emphasized the long road ahead .""At the end of tonight, 15 states will have voted; 35 states remain,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""And let me assure you that we are going to take our fight for economic justice, for social justice, for environmental sanity, for a world of peace, to every one of those states.""At stake were 878 pledged delegates to the summer convention, the biggest single-day prize in the Democratic race and more than one-third of the 2,383 delegates needed to capture the nomination. Eleven states were in play, plus American Samoa and a contingent of Democrats living abroad.Late in the evening, Mrs. Clinton had added 373 delegates , giving her 464 pledged delegates, which are awarded by voters. In addition, she has support of 457 superdelegates, who can vote for anyone they choose, according to a tally by the Associated Press.Mr. Sanders had added 189 delegates, giving him 254, plus 22 superdelegates.Mr. Sanders came into Super Tuesday after a 48-percentage-point loss in South Carolina last Saturday, his second defeat in a row. The loss pointed to a structural weakness in his campaign: difficulty making inroads with African-American voters who have yet to warm in large numbers to his message about income inequality and the unfairness of the campaign-finance system.Though Mr. Sanders is flush with campaign money, his advisers decided not to air TV ads in some of the Super Tuesday states with large minority populations, given his low odds of prevailing there. The Sanders campaign focused his TV advertising instead on other Super Tuesday states that looked more promising, including Colorado, Minnesota, Virginia and Oklahoma.Mr. Sanders needed to put some wins on the board and undercut perceptions that his rival was the inevitable nominee. His easy win in Vermont was expected; he won re-election in 2012 with 71% of the vote.With 89% of the Oklahoma vote counted, Mr. Sanders had 52% compared with 41% for Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders also invested heavily in Minnesota and Colorado, visiting both states repeatedly. Mr. Sanders drew 18,000 people in a rally in Denver last month and thousands more at a rally at Colorado State University on Sunday.Still, the senator's challenge has been converting that enthusiasm into votes.Turnout on the Democratic side has flagged compared with the 2008 election, when Mrs. Clinton ran against then-Sen. Barack Obama. In the New Hampshire primary last month, Democratic turnout was 13% lower than in 2008, and in South Carolina, it was 31% lower.That could present a challenge to Democrats in the general election, as turnout in the raucous Republican primaries has been higher.Dan Frosch contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",3/7/16
Hillary Clinton Faces a Test Wooing Bernie Sanders Backers; Interviews suggest some of the Vermont senator's fans wouldn't support the front-runner,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770999940?accountid=12768,"LINCOLN, Neb.--It is rare for the crowd to boo at a Bernie Sanders rally. When it happens, it is usually at the point he invokes the name of his opponent in the Democratic presidential race, Hillary Clinton.With Mrs. Clinton holding a substantial lead in the race for convention delegates, many Sanders loyalists are grappling with an uncomfortable question: If he loses, would they back her?Interviews with a number of Sanders supporters present an unclear picture. Some say they wouldn't vote for the former senator and secretary of state if she wins the party nomination. Others say they would, reluctantly. Still others see strengths in Mrs. Clinton and would unconditionally back her for the White House.The Democratic primary fight has been nowhere near as divisive as the Republican one. Still, in a campaign stop Monday in Grand Rapids, Mich., Mrs. Clinton made clear she is aware of what might lie ahead as she talked about the hard-fought 2008 race against Barack Obama and her work in helping the nominee pull in her supporters once he wrapped up the nomination that June.That effort wasn't entirely successful--one pro-Clinton group held out and defiantly campaigned for Republican nominee John McCain.""I had a lot of passionate supporters who did not feel like they wanted to support then-Sen. Obama. I worked as hard as I could. I nominated him at the convention. I made the case, because he and I shared a lot of the same views,"" she said. ""I would hope to be able to enlist Bernie in helping me reach out to his supporters if I am so fortunate to be the nominee.""Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, has given every indication he would endorse Mrs. Clinton if she wins the nomination. He says he likes and respects her and has set limits on how negative he is willing to go.But it isn't clear how many of his die-hard supporters would fall in line. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed half the Sanders supporters have a positive view of Mrs. Clinton, but 31% have a negative one. About four in 10 Sanders supporters say they worry about Mrs. Clinton's ""ties to Wall Street and millions in speaking fees.""At a speech in Lincoln last week, Mr. Sanders elicited boos when he mentioned Wall Street donations collected by a pro-Clinton super PAC.Kathleen Worcester, a 42-year-old who came to hear Mr. Sanders at a rally last week in Portland, Maine, said she is unsure of what she would do if her candidate doesn't win. Mrs. Clinton ""seems like a moderate conservative to me,"" she said.Clinton aides say she has long been mindful that, as a nominee, she would need the support of Sanders backers, many of whom see her as the embodiment of the establishment politics they hope the senator would vanquish.At times, she has been sharply critical of Mr. Sanders--the two candidates interrupted and talked over each other at a testy debate Sunday night in Flint, Mich. --but she has also tried to direct her barbs at Republicans in hopes of unifying Democrats behind a common enemy.""We have differences, but those differences pale in comparison to what we see going on with the Republicans right now,"" she said in Grand Rapids.And she has offered overt outreach, particularly to the young voters who overwhelmingly favor Mr. Sanders. ""I want you to know,"" she tells those voters, ""even if you don't support me, I support you.""For now, Mr. Sanders is doing nothing to endear the front-runner to his supporters. ""There are many people, including my opponent, who want you to think kind of small,"" he said at a recent campaign stop.Marcus Johnson, 24, one of about 10,000 people who came to hear Mr. Sanders speak at Michigan State University last week, said he would never vote for Mrs. Clinton and would consider backing the Green Party candidate if Mr. Sanders doesn't win the nomination.""Honestly, I think she's a Republican,"" he said.Others are open to supporting her, though some say unenthusiastically.""It would be a definite vote against the GOP and not for Hillary,"" said Harriet Scureman, 71, of Norwalk, Conn. ""There isn't anything Hillary does or says that inspires me or makes me think she will make a difference.""On the other hand, Katherine Steinfield, 22, a senior at Michigan State who prefers Mr. Sanders, said Mrs. Clinton, as a woman, has had to overcome obstacles that Mr. Sanders never faced. ""I think she's impressive, too,"" she said.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",3/8/16
"Hillary Clinton Widens Delegate Lead, but Bernie Sanders Shows Strength; Vermont senator's Michigan victory gives him a jolt ahead of March 15 contests",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771617916?accountid=12768,"Even as Hillary Clinton continued to pad her lead in the delegate count, Bernie Sanders's victory in Michigan showed strength for the first time in a large, racially diverse state far from his home base of New England.The Vermont senator and Mrs. Clinton split Michigan's 147 delegates, 65 to 58 for Mr. Sanders. But the former secretary of state won Mississippi by a wide margin, gaining 29 of the 33 delegates. She now has 1,221 delegates , more than half the 2,302 she needs to win the nomination, the Associated Press reports. Mr. Sanders has 571.Clinton campaign officials on Wednesday continued to project confidence, noting that even though Mrs. Clinton narrowly lost Michigan, she netted more delegates in Tuesday's contests by winning big in Mississippi.""From the beginning, we have approached this nomination contest as a battle for delegates,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. ""So, while Sen. Sanders has placed big bets on pulling out wins in certain individual states, we have sought to compete everywhere in every state with the goal of amassing the most delegates possible.""""Last night really showed why that approach makes sense,"" Mr. Mook added.Mrs. Clinton's win in Mississippi completed a clean sweep of the Deep South powered by her overwhelming popularity among African-American voters in the region. But Mr. Sanders, in winning his most populous state this primary season, made inroads with black voters in Michigan, according to exit polls, winning 30% of the state's African-American primary vote.The victory gives Mr. Sanders a jolt of momentum at an important moment in the race. He and Mrs. Clinton face off Wednesday night in a debate in Florida.Tad Devine, a senior strategist for the Sanders campaign, said Michigan sent an important message about Mr. Sanders's viability.""It's a big win,"" Mr. Devine said. It's going to give a lot of people who weren't sure that Bernie could really prevail in this process a lot of hope that he will. Interest in his candidacy will rise and support of his candidacy both from voters and financial supporters will increase as a result of it.""Nearly 700 convention delegates are at stake in the next round of voting on March 15, and the Sanders camp hopes the Michigan result will reverberate in two other large Midwestern states that vote then: Ohio and Illinois.The other three states to vote next Tuesday are Florida, Missouri and North Carolina.A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed the Democratic race tightening nationally, with Mrs. Clinton's lead over Mr. Sanders narrowing to nine points among Democratic primary voters. In February, the former secretary of state led by 11 points, and in January, she led by 24 points in the poll.Both candidates had fought hard in Michigan. Trailing in delegates and written off by some Democrats, Mr. Sanders visited the state repeatedly and aired TV ads for the past three weeks in hopes of proving he could go toe-to-toe with Mrs. Clinton in a large industrial state.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Capital Journal: Angry White Males Propel Donald Trump--and Bernie Sanders* Tenor of Campaign Takes a Toll: WSJ/NBC Poll* Democrats Draw a Diverse Voting Pool in Exit Polls* Clinton's Lead Over Sanders Narrows Slightly in WSJ/NBC Poll* Michigan Turnout Shows Split on ClintonDespite Mrs. Clinton's blowout win in Mississippi , the Michigan loss is a serious setback given the time she spent campaigning in the state. Mrs. Clinton put the water crisis in the city of Flint front-and-center, using her national platform to get more money and assistance for a city plagued by polluted drinking water.On the trail, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, repeatedly invoked her response to the Flint crisis as evidence she has the temperament and judgment to be president. The appeal fell short, with Mr. Sanders winning the bulk of counties across the state, although Mrs. Clinton won the counties in the populous Detroit region.""There are similarities between Michigan and parts of Ohio and Illinois that have experienced high levels of deindustrialization due to policies that Secretary Clinton has supported over and over again,"" said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager.That line of attack has been taken by Mr. Sanders himself, highlighting Mrs. Clinton's early support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Pacific Rim nations and for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by her husband in the 1990s.Bob Davis contributed to this article.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Peter Nicholas",3/9/16
Democratic Presidential Candidates Eye Next Fights After Split Weekend Wins; Bernie Sanders says he still has a path to victory; Hillary Clinton plays up her lead in delegate totals,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770796585?accountid=12768,"FLINT, Mich.--A split in the outcome of Democratic contests over the weekend did little to change the contours of the race between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, and polls showed the former secretary of state is poised to soon build on her delegate lead in larger states.Mr. Sanders scored victories in the Nebraska and Kansas caucuses on Saturday and in Maine on Sunday , where he held a 64% to 36% advantage with four-fifths of precincts reporting.But his wins in smaller states didn't dent Mrs. Clinton's lead among pledged delegates. She won big in Saturday'sprimary in Louisiana , beating the Vermont senator by 48 percentage points and continuing her domination in Southern states where minority voters make up a larger share of the electorate.More on Election 2016* Flint Democratic Presidential Debate--Recap* Clinton, Sanders Head Into Seventh Democratic Primary Debate* Clinton's Louisiana Win Helps Offset Two Caucus Defeats* Trump Leads Rivals in Michigan, Trails Clinton in General Election Test, Poll Finds* Flint Begins Replacing Lead PipesMr. Sanders's opportunities to change this dynamic are dwindling. The next votes will be cast Tuesday in Michigan, as well as Mississippi.A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll shows Mrs. Clinton with a double-digit lead in Michigan. Mrs. Clinton is the preferred candidate of 57% of likely Democratic primary voters, while 40% back the Vermont senator, according to the poll, which was released Sunday.The candidates squared off in a debate Sunday in Flint , which has been buffeted by a crisis from lead-poisoned water . Mr. Sanders said he was ""shattered"" by what he heard about the water crisis in town-hall meetings.""It was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan, in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned. That is clearly not what this country should be about,"" he said.He repeated his call for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to resign. For the first time, Mrs. Clinton agreed and added that if he doesn't resign, he should be recalled. That was a shift; in the past, she mocked that solution as inadequate.""It is raining lead in Flint,"" Mrs. Clinton said Sunday, urging the state to take money from its ""rainy day"" fund to help. ""The state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required.""After notching wins in weekend caucuses, the Vermont senator declared he still has a path to victory, vowing to take his campaign all the way to the Democratic convention in July. Mrs. Clinton, though, noted that she actually won more delegates in Saturday's contests.""We will net delegates and we're feeling good about the coming contests,"" Mrs. Clinton told CBS on Sunday.Mrs. Clinton solidified her position last week as the Democratic front-runner with a sweep of delegate-rich states on Super Tuesday. Her delegate lead now exceeds the largest margin then-Sen. Barack Obama ever held during his march to the Democratic nomination in 2008. Making up ground will be a steep challenge for Mr. Sanders, in part because delegates are awarded proportionally.Still, Sanders campaign officials have argued the calendar was ""front-loaded"" with states that were essentially friendly terrain for Mrs. Clinton.They have projected confidence that he can win more of the later contests.The Democratic candidates have long trained their sights on the Michigan primary, with Sanders campaign officials characterizing the contest as a ""big showdown."" But to win there, the Vermont senator would need to broaden his coalition and win more support from minority voters--something he so far hasn't done.On Sunday, Mr. Sanders predicted he would gain traction, particularly with younger minority voters.""What we are seeing in many cases is not just a racial divide but a generational divide,"" Mr. Sanders said on CNN. ""We are doing better and better with younger people whether they're black, Latino or white.""""Truth is, we have not done well in the deep South, but I am absolutely certain that our numbers will continue to get better,"" he added.While Mrs. Clinton has carried minority voters by wide margins, she noted on Sunday that she also has won more support from white voters than her opponent.""I have gotten more votes than anybody running on either side,"" she told CBS. ""And we have gotten it from a wide, broad base....In the Democratic primary election, I have gotten more white voters, except for the state of Vermont. All told, I have had more support from white voters.""Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders pressed their cases in Michigan, scheduling events across the state ahead of the primary. The former secretary of state spoke at three Detroit-area churches on Sunday, and Mr. Sanders planned a trio of campaign rallies in the state on Monday.On Sunday morning, Mrs. Clinton continued to take aim at Republican front-runner Donald Trump and his promise to ""make America great again."" She told parishioners in Detroit that the country never stopped being great but that she would make the country whole again.Brent Kendall and Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",3/9/16
"Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders Head Into Seventh Democratic Primary Debate; Pressure is on Sanders to change the dynamics of the contest",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770596654?accountid=12768,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will meet in Flint, Mich. on Sunday for the seventh Democratic primary debate of the 2016 presidential-election cycle, facing off after both notched victories over the weekend.Mrs. Clinton looks increasingly well positioned to win the nomination in the coming weeks after winning the majority of states and delegates in Tuesday's 11 state nominating contests and posting convincing victories in Louisiana, South Carolina and Nevada in February.Mr. Sanders, who has seen his momentum stall since winning New Hampshire in early February, won Saturday caucuses in Nebraska and Kansas. He has vowed to continue his campaign, though his path to winning the Democratic nomination is increasingly narrow.Heading into Saturday's contests, Mrs. Clinton held a lead of 604 to 408 in pledged delegates. She also has the support of 458 ""superdelegates""--party leaders and officials free to back the candidate of their choosing.This is the first of two debates this week. The candidates are scheduled to meet again on Wednesday in Miami. Two more debates are scheduled after that with dates and times still to be determined.Here's what each candidate needs to do in Sunday's meeting:Hillary ClintonMrs. Clinton has shone on the debate stage in previous appearances, coming across as polished and substantive. She is likely to be equally well prepared Sunday.After running up big margins among black voters in a number of crucial states Mrs. Clinton has again assumed the mantle of front-runner in the Democratic race. In short, the pressure is now on Mr. Sanders to change the dynamics of the race with his performance.Mrs. Clinton will need to avoid major pitfalls or stumbles. She also needs to be ready to answer questions from the moderators about the FBI investigation into her private email server while serving at the State Department. And she has struggled to answer Mr. Sanders's attacks on Wall Street.She is at her strongest when talking about foreign affairs, after serving as Secretary of State for three years. On domestic policy, she is more vulnerable to Mr. Sanders's attacks--particularly on her long financial relationship with Wall Street donors. She will need to parry those attacks and convince Democratic primary voters that she can be trusted to regulate.In the absence of major stumbles or unexpected developments in the controversies over her use of private email, Mrs. Clinton remains well positioned to clinch the nomination in the coming weeks.Bernie SandersMr. Sanders has failed to make any dent in Mrs. Clinton's huge level of support from African-American voters--and the result has been a series of losses in largely southern states with black populations while picking up traction in mostly white states.His single biggest challenge remains improving his numbers with those voters.""What we are seeing in many cases is not just a racial divide but a generational divide,"" Mr. Sanders said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We are doing better and better with younger people whether they're black, Latino or white.""""Truth is, we have not done well in the deep south but I am absolutely certain that our numbers will continue to get better,"" he added.Nationally televised debates still remain one of the best ways to do that. He will have to make the case that he, not Mrs. Clinton, is best positioned to address issues of racial inequality and discrimination and that his policies will have tangible benefits for many black voters.He also will have to grapple with the fact that Democratic primary voters--especially African-Americans--by and large want to continue with President Barack Obama's policies, according to many polls. Mr. Sanders, on the other hand, has built his campaign around calling for what he calls a ""political revolution""--calling for radical change on health-care policy and Wall Street regulation.He will have to reassure many Democrats that he intends to build on Mr. Obama's legacy, not tear it down.Brent Kendall contributed to this article.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Byron Tau",3/9/16

Ted Cruz of Texas won the Republican caucuses in Kansas and Maine on Saturday, while front-runner Donald Trump took the Louisiana primary.On the Democratic side, Sen.

Sen. Marco Rubio had nearly 17% of the vote, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich had nearly 11%. Kansas allocates its 40 convention delegates on a proportional basis to candidates who earn at least 10%.The state, one of four to vote in the Republican contests on Saturday, was expected to be favorable ground for Mr. Cruz because evangelicals make up about one-third of the total population. Mr. Cruz had made Kansas his first campaign destination after he won three states, to Mr. Trump's seven, in the Super Tuesday contests.In Maine, Mr. Cruz had 46% of the vote, while Mr. Trump had 33%. Mr. Kasich was in third place with 12%.In Louisiana, Mr. Trump had nearly 48% of the vote in the early stages of counting. The Republican contest in Kentucky had yet to be called.With the Kansas and Maine victories, Mr. Cruz has won six states, the second-most after Mr. Trump's 11. Mr. Rubio has one just one state, Minnesota.Mr. Sanders's wins in the Democratic caucuses could help slow Mrs. Clinton's ability to widen her delegate lead over the Vermont senator. Mr. Sanders had 55% in Nebraska versus 45% for Mrs. Clinton.

"Bernie Sanders's Plan Would Raise Taxes by 34%, Analysis Finds; Candidate concentrates increases on high-income households, but every bracket would pay more",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770399411?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders's tax plan is just as revolutionary as he promises--raising federal tax revenue by 34% and cutting the after-tax incomes of the wealthiest households nearly in half, according to an analysis released Friday.Mr. Sanders's plan, designed to pay for a significant expansion of government spending, is the largest and most dramatic of all the presidential candidates' and the least likely to find support from either party in Congress. That is saying something in a year when Republicans are proposing unprecedentedly large tax cuts and structural changes.Mr. Sanders's proposals would increase federal taxes by $15.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. Mr. Sanders concentrates his tax increases on high-income households, which would face sharply higher levies on their wages, business income, capital gains and estates, as well as more limits on their deductions. The top 0.1%--those with incomes of $3.7 million under an expanded definition--would pay an average federal tax rate of 63.7% in 2017, up from 34.2%.The middle 20% of households would face an average tax increase of $4,692 in 2017 and lose 8.5% of after-tax income. The lowest-income households would lose, too, but they would come out even by 2025.""Sanders is clearly betting that people are willing to pay for his expansive new welfare state,"" said Leonard Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, who was a Treasury Department official under President Bill Clinton. ""There's a giant tax increase, mostly on the rich, but everyone would pay more.""The top effective marginal tax rate on wages would increase to 64.2% from 43.1%, and Mr. Sanders would raise the top rate on capital gains to 62% from 24.1%, while making it harder for wealthy individuals to defer or avoid capital gains taxes. He also would limit U.S. companies' ability to defer U.S. taxes on their foreign income, impose new taxes on financial transactions and create a new tax on carbon, with a rebate for consumers.New payroll taxes on employers and on all workers would pay for what Mr. Sanders calls Medicare for all and for paid family leave. The $15.3 trillion estimate appears to leave Mr. Sanders several trillion dollars short of paying for his promises, and that is assuming the tax increases don't inhibit economic growth.The center said Mr. Sanders's tax plan ""would substantially reduce incentives to save and invest in the U.S."" and would discourage lower-earning spouses from entering the workforce.The Sanders campaign didn't respond immediately to a request for comment on Friday. The campaign has said many households would fare better because they would be receiving expanded federal benefits, such as free college tuition and government-provided health care. The center's analysis doesn't include those benefits.Mr. Sanders's plan stands in contrast with that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. She proposes raising taxes on high-income households to pay for new spending and is offering targeted tax breaks and a forthcoming tax cut for middle-income households. For every $1 she is proposing to raise in taxes, Mr. Sanders wants to raise $14.24.""Her experience in government and in politics for a long time tells her that those are the kinds of things she could get done. Bernie Sanders clearly wants to change things radically,"" Mr. Burman said.The center has now completed its estimates of the tax plans of the five leading presidential candidates--the two Democrats, along with Republicans Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. The center hasn't analyzed Republican John Kasich's plans because it lacks sufficient detail. In the general election, Mr. Burman said, the center will attempt to analyze the economic effect of tax changes along with the combined effect of tax and spending proposals.The center is a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, and it used a bipartisan panel of reviewers to examine the Sanders plan.Its economists are generally skeptical of the idea that tax changes can prompt major economic responses. But Mr. Sanders's plan is so big that it might be different, the report said.""The proposed tax changes on both labor and capital income are very large compared with any tax policy changes since World War II, so the empirical evidence of relatively small effects cited earlier may not apply,"" the report said. ""The lack of prior historical experience for changes of this magnitude makes the macroeconomic effects of Sanders's plan especially uncertain, but there is a risk that the very large tax increases could significantly weaken the U.S. economy.""Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comCredit: By Richard Rubin",3/9/16

"Hillary Clinton Widens Delegate Lead, but Bernie Sanders Shows Strength; Vermont senator's Michigan victory gives him a jolt ahead of March 15 contests",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771588198?accountid=12768,"Even as Hillary Clinton continued to pad her lead in the delegate count, Bernie Sanders's victory in Michigan showed strength for the first time in a large, racially diverse state far from his home base of New England.The Vermont senator and Mrs. Clinton split Michigan's 147 delegates, 65 to 58 for Mr. Sanders. But the former secretary of state won Mississippi by a wide margin, gaining 29 of the 33 delegates. She now has 1,221 delegates , more than half the 2,302 she needs to win the nomination, the Associated Press reports. Mr. Sanders has 571.Clinton campaign officials on Wednesday continued to project confidence, noting that even though Mrs. Clinton narrowly lost Michigan, she netted more delegates in Tuesday's contests by winning big in Mississippi.""From the beginning, we have approached this nomination contest as a battle for delegates,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. ""So, while Sen. Sanders has placed big bets on pulling out wins in certain individual states, we have sought to compete everywhere in every state with the goal of amassing the most delegates possible.""""Last night really showed why that approach makes sense,"" Mr. Mook added.Mrs. Clinton's win in Mississippi completed a clean sweep of the Deep South powered by her overwhelming popularity among African-American voters in the region. But Mr. Sanders, in winning his most populous state this primary season, made inroads with black voters in Michigan, according to exit polls, winning 30% of the state's African-American primary vote.The victory gives Mr. Sanders a jolt of momentum at an important moment in the race. He and Mrs. Clinton face off Wednesday night in a debate in Florida.Tad Devine, a senior strategist for the Sanders campaign, said Michigan sent an important message about Mr. Sanders's viability.""It's a big win,"" Mr. Devine said. It's going to give a lot of people who weren't sure that Bernie could really prevail in this process a lot of hope that he will. Interest in his candidacy will rise and support of his candidacy both from voters and financial supporters will increase as a result of it.""Nearly 700 convention delegates are at stake in the next round of voting on March 15, and the Sanders camp hopes the Michigan result will reverberate in two other large Midwestern states that vote then: Ohio and Illinois.The other three states to vote next Tuesday are Florida, Missouri and North Carolina.A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed the Democratic race tightening nationally, with Mrs. Clinton's lead over Mr. Sanders narrowing to nine points among Democratic primary voters. In February, the former secretary of state led by 11 points, and in January, she led by 24 points in the poll.Both candidates had fought hard in Michigan. Trailing in delegates and written off by some Democrats, Mr. Sanders visited the state repeatedly and aired TV ads for the past three weeks in hopes of proving he could go toe-to-toe with Mrs. Clinton in a large industrial state.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Capital Journal: Angry White Males Propel Donald Trump--and Bernie Sanders* Tenor of Campaign Takes a Toll: WSJ/NBC Poll* Democrats Draw a Diverse Voting Pool in Exit Polls* Clinton's Lead Over Sanders Narrows Slightly in WSJ/NBC Poll* Michigan Turnout Shows Split on ClintonDespite Mrs. Clinton's blowout win in Mississippi , the Michigan loss is a serious setback given the time she spent campaigning in the state. Mrs. Clinton put the water crisis in the city of Flint front-and-center, using her national platform to get more money and assistance for a city plagued by polluted drinking water.On the trail, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, repeatedly invoked her response to the Flint crisis as evidence she has the temperament and judgment to be president. The appeal fell short, with Mr. Sanders winning the bulk of counties across the state, although Mrs. Clinton won the counties in the populous Detroit region.""There are similarities between Michigan and parts of Ohio and Illinois that have experienced high levels of deindustrialization due to policies that Secretary Clinton has supported over and over again,"" said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager.That line of attack has been taken by Mr. Sanders himself, highlighting Mrs. Clinton's early support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Pacific Rim nations and for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by her husband in the 1990s.Bob Davis contributed to this article.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Peter Nicholas",3/10/16
Sanders Surprise; Michigan wasn't even supposed to be close.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771548656?accountid=12768,"(Note: We'll be off tomorrow, returning Friday.) Maybe they thought he was related to local sports hero Barry Sanders. OK, that's implausible, but would you have believed us if we'd told you yesterday that Bernie Sanders was going to win the Michigan primary? Not if you checked the polls: The Real Clear Politics average, consisting of three surveys in the past week, put inevitable Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton up by 21.4 points; her narrowest margin in the trio of surveys was 13.The actual result: Sanders 49.8%, Mrs. Clinton 48.3%. Close, but a cigar.Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, trounced Sanders in Mississippi , 82.6% to 16.5%--almost as wide a margin as his a week ago in the People's Republic of Vermont . But that was entirely expected. Mrs. Clinton has been sweeping the South, where the Democratic electorate is heavily black. In Mississippi , exit polls found blacks made up 71% of the electorate and went for Mrs. Clinton 89% to 11%.But in Michigan , only 23% of whose electorate is black, Sanders did better: 31% of the black vote vs. 65% for Mrs. Clinton. That could augur well for next week's primaries in Illinois and Ohio. And FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver observed not long before midnight:Although there are a lot of reasonably good Clinton states on March 15--according to both polls and demographics--we then have a stretch of states that look quite strong for Sanders. These include Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Alaska, Washington, Hawaii, Wisconsin and Wyoming, all of which vote from March 22 to April 9.So if [Mrs.] Clinton underperforms her polls on March 15 in states such as Ohio as she did tonight in Michigan--and pollsters probably ought to be checking their turnout models carefully after tonight -- she could have a really long few weeks ahead, even though Sanders's delegate math remains highly challenging.To the extent that Sanders remains a viable candidate, we'd say it is because of two factors of demography--one a strength of his, the other a weakness of Mrs. Clinton's. The strength has been much remarked upon: Sanders's overwhelming support, outside the South anyway, from young voters.Michigan follows the pattern: Under-30 voters favored him 81% to 18%; over-65 voters backed her, 68% to 31%. Every way the pollsters break it down, there is a clear inverse correlation between age and Sanders support.In January Peggy Noonan argued that Sanders's appeal to the young is in large part ideological. For voters under 30, the events of 2008 would have played a significant part in informing their views of capitalism. Meanwhile they (and perhaps those up to a decade older) have little or no memory of the Cold War to turn them against socialism. And if Donald Trump loves the poorly educated , Bernie Sanders loves--or at least has put himself in a position to capitalize on--the miseducated:Let's say you're 20 or 30, meaning you'll be voting for a long time. What in your formative years would have taught you about the excellence of free markets, low taxes, ""a friendly business climate""? A teacher in public high school? Maybe one--the faculty-lounge eccentric who boycotted the union meetings. And who in our colleges teaches the virtues of capitalism?Mrs. Clinton's weakness is one we've discussed before : Even among Democrats, she is on the distaff side of a gender gap. In Michigan she outpolled Sanders 51% to 46% among women, but he beat her 55% to 43% among men. That was enough to give him the victory even though women made up 56% of the Democratic electorate.Part of this gap is likely an artifact of the age distribution: Women tend to live longer than men, and thus (at least in the general population) tend increasingly to outnumber men of their cohort as time passes. But Mrs. Clinton and her supporters have also made heavy-handed appeals to female solidarity.The inevitable nominee herself achieved self-parody when she declared in a February debate : ""Honestly, Sen. Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.""Honestly! Even Claire Underwood doesn't try to portray herself as an outsider. Fiction has to be believable. Nonfiction only has to be true.We've noted that such appeals seem to hold no interest for younger women, and we've argued that men of all ages are likely to find them off-putting. What's more, while there is no doubt a subset of the female population that sees ""the first woman president"" as a major selling point, it's not as if anyone is unaware of Mrs. Clinton's sex. What does it accomplish to belabor the point?Yet belabor it Mrs. Clinton and her supporters, including in the media, do. The latest kerfuffle arose in this past Sunday's debate when, as Vox's German Lopez describes it, Sanders ""came off as a man shouting down a woman. And the live audience did not like it one bit.""What happened? As Lopez acknowledges, she interrupted him, and he objected: ""Excuse me, I'm talking.""The Washington Post's Janell Ross has a lengthy explainer of why Sanders was wrong to object to Mrs. Clinton's womanterruption:Why, at this late date and this many debates into the 2016 presidential election cycle, has Sanders made demonstrably little to no effort to alter the way he interacts with the woman he at least strongly suspected he would be running against him from the day he declared his campaign? He has almost certainly had the same advice and information that every male candidate gets about the need to be constantly mindful about coming across like a chauvinist or a bully when on a debate stage facing a female competition.As Rich Lowry observes understatedly: ""The debate flap demonstrates how feminism is caught between its dual insistence that women are indistinguishable from men and at the same time due special consideration because they're uniquely vulnerable to slights, intended or unintended.""We suppose the debate, which was held in Michigan, couldn't actually have hurt Sanders that much, seeing as how he did manage to win there when everyone expected him to lose. It's only a matter of time before somebody calls him piggish for upsetting Mrs. Clinton on International Women's Day .Other Than That, the Story Was Accurate ""Due to an oversight involving a haphazardly-installed Chrome extension during the editing process, the name Donald Trump was erroneously replaced with the phrase 'Someone With Tiny Hands' when this story originally published.""--Wired.com, March 9Fox Butterfield, Is That You?

Mitt Romney's exhortation to anti-Trump Republicans to vote strategically didn't yield much, especially in Michigan, where Ted Cruz edged out John Kasich, both of whom were between 24% and 25% of the vote to Trump's 36.6%. And Marco Rubio pretty much collapsed.A bit of a yawn, albeit one that probably wasn't followed by a sound sleep for Trump opponents. So we thought we'd follow the Puffington Host's lead and cover it in our entertainment section, namely the amusing last item of our column.One Trump foe who must be sighing with relief is the New York Times's David Brooks --not because he's pleased with the result but because he got yesterday's column, titled ""It's Not Too Late!,"" out just in the nick of time. Here's his lead:It's 2 a.m. The bar is closing. Republicans have had a series of strong and nasty Trump cocktails. Suddenly Ted Cruz is beginning to look kind of attractive. At least he's sort of predictable, and he doesn't talk about his sexual organs in presidential debates!Well, Republicans, have your standards really fallen so low so fast? Are you really that desperate? Can you remember your 8 p.m. selves, and all the hope you had about entering a campaign with such a deep bench of talented candidates?What a vulgar and disgusting analogy. But anyway, you get the point--Brooks hates both Trump and Cruz, who increasingly look like the only two candidates standing. A reader reminds us that in 2006 Brooks declared his allegiance to a notional third party: ""There are two major parties on the ballot, but there are three major parties in America. There is the Democratic Party, the Republican Party and the McCain-Lieberman Party.""That would be Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. The latter had just been defeated by a left-wing primary challenger and was seeking re-election as an independent. He won and served one more term, retiring in 2013. But in 2008 the ""McCain-Lieberman Party"" took over the GOP, which nominated McCain as president and featured a prime-time convention speech from Lieberman. That didn't work out so well in November, for which we're pretty sure Brooks blames Sarah Palin. The McCain-Lieberman Party was supposed to have a more selective appeal.It also occurred to us that back in 1997 Brooks penned an article for the Weekly Standard titled ""A Return to National Greatness."" No wonder he can't stand Trump: ""Make America Great Again"" was Brooks's idea!Brooks's colleague Thomas Friedman , meanwhile, is taking Trump seriously as a general election candidate. ""He is still sitting with three aces that he hasn't played yet,"" Friedman avers: his ability to move to the center, his hard line on terrorism, and his willingness to ""go after Hillary Clinton in ways you never heard before."" (For the record, we've heard a lot.)""But,"" Friedman cautions, ""Trump is also holding two jokers with those aces.""All we can say is, if you can ever get into a poker game with Friedman, do it. The guy doesn't even know that five aces beats every other hand.The Times editorial board manages to find something new to complain about:You would think that if the leader of a country friendly to America likened a serious contender for the American presidency to two of the premier villains of the 20th century, it would set off an uproar.But Donald Trump has so debased the tone of the presidential race that there was hardly a murmur when President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico did just that this week. Not only was there no way Mexico would pay for Mr. Trump's wall along the border, but that sort of demagogy, Mr. Peña Nieto said, was ""how Mussolini got in, that's how Hitler got in.""When decent men like Reagan and the Bushes ran the Republican Party, you could liken them to Hitler and be taken seriously. What has the world come to?As usual, Trump declared victory in Florida, giving a long, rambling speech-cum-news-conference in Jupiter (he needed gravitas). He served reporters and attendees what he said were ""Trump Steaks"" but actually, as Florida man Greg Pollowitz points out, came from a West Palm Beach butcher called Bush Brothers . No joke.It got us to thinking: Might Trump have beaten Marco Rubio on Sunday if he'd promised to make Puerto Rico a steak ?Follow @jamestaranto on Twitter.Join Fans of Best of the Web Today on Facebook.Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.(Carol Muller helps compile Best of the Web.

Angry White Males Propel Donald Trump--and Bernie Sanders; Many presidential primary voters feel free trade has marginalized their jobs and prospects,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771334912?accountid=12768,"Tuesday's primary elections underscored an emerging, central reality of the 2016 presidential campaign: This is the year of the angry white male.Those white males are the voters who propelled Donald Trump to convincing victories Tuesday in Michigan and Mississippi, as they have elsewhere.

Bernie Sanders to a stunning victory over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic contest in Michigan, and may keep him in the game for many weeks to come.All of this further suggests they may be the swing voters who decide the general election in November, when the critical question could well be whether Democrats can win enough of them to supplement their big advantages among women and minority voters.The effect was most obvious in watching Mr. Trump roll up two more big wins Tuesday. In Michigan, 52% of the Republican primary electorate was male, exit polls indicated. Mr. Trump won them going away, 43% to 23% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Meantime, he lost among women, 30% for Sen. Ted Cruz to 28% for Mr. Trump.The story was similar in Mississippi. Mr. Trump won men by 20 percentage points, exit polls indicated. There, he won women, but by a mere 9 percentage points.So, the more male the Republican electorate, the better for Mr. Trump. Also, the angrier as well.In Mississippi, 41% of Republicans described their feelings toward the federal government as ""angry""--and Mr. Trump won a whopping 57% of them. Meanwhile in Michigan, 32% of Republican voters said they were angry at the federal government, and Mr. Trump won 48% of them, compared with 24% for Mr. Cruz.And what are these folks angry about? Here's a pretty good clue:When voters were asked in Michigan whether trade with other countries creates jobs or takes away jobs, just over half of GOP respondents said it takes away jobs--this is in the Republican Party that once was the bastion of strong belief in free trade. And among those who see trade as a job killer, Mr. Trump won going away, 42% to 23% for Mr. Cruz.Here's a bit more evidence that the Trump army is made up of people angry over the belief the economy has left them behind: Among white college graduates in Michigan, he lost to Mr. Kasich. But among whites without a college degree, he won by almost 20 percentage points.Perhaps more interesting, angry white males are sustaining the Sanders campaign, not just the Trump campaign.In Michigan, they kept him nearly even with Mrs. Clinton, offsetting her big advantage among women and among minorities. Among women, exit polls indicate, he finished just behind Mrs. Clinton. But among men, he won easily, 54% to 44%.Like Mr. Trump, he seemed to do especially well among those who consider themselves stuck outside the economic mainstream. Among those who considered income inequality the top issue, he beat Mrs. Clinton 60% to 39%. And among those who think trade takes away jobs, he won 56% to 43%.Together, in other words, Messrs. Trump and Sanders are collapsing what had become, in the 1990s, something of a bipartisan consensus in favor of free trade. And angry white males, many of whom feel trade has marginalized their jobs and prospects, are leading the way.In the end, it may well be that these voters are sufficient to propel Mr. Trump to the GOP nomination; we may well know for sure after primaries next week in the big industrial states of Ohio, Illinois and Missouri. But they probably aren't enough to carry Mr. Sanders to the Democratic nomination.Which would set up a fascinating battle in the fall. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, Mrs. Clinton beats Mr. Trump in a hypothetical general-election matchup, 51% to 38%. But among white men? He wins comfortably, 53% to 35%.Could he hold on to such an advantage, and build up elsewhere? Or would she eat into and undermine his clearest pillar of strength? On such questions may November's outcome be decided.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",3/10/16
"Behind Hillary's Lock on Black Support; If Bernie Sanders can't shake her big lead with African-Americans, he's essentially done.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771301628?accountid=12768,"The dynamic of the Democratic presidential contest is clear, and Sen. Bernie Sanders cannot prevail unless he changes it. He can win in states with below-average shares of African-American voters. But in the states with substantial African-American electorates, he loses badly to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In recent days, she has received 81% of the African-American vote in Georgia, 83% in Texas, 84% in Virginia, 86% in South Carolina, 89% in Tennessee, 90% in Arkansas and 91% in Alabama. Adding to Mr. Sanders's challenge, Mrs. Clinton also racked up 71% of the Latino vote in Texas, an ominous sign for his prospects in Florida on March 15.Margins of this magnitude cry out for explanation. Yes, Mrs. Clinton has a civil-rights record stretching back decades, but so does Mr. Sanders. No doubt her frequent visits to African-American churches and civic organizations, which have made her a familiar and trusted figure in this community, are part of the story. But more than that: Bill Clinton's two terms were years of rapid progress for African-Americans, who hope that a second Clinton presidency can deliver more of the same.During Mr. Clinton's eight years in office, median household income rose to $57,700 from $50,700, a sturdy 14%. Among African-Americans, it rose by even more, to $40,800 from $31,000--32%. While the overall poverty rate fell by 3.5 percentage points, it fell for African-Americans by 10.9 points, the most since the 1960s, reflecting in part a surge of African-American women into the labor force. The national homeownership rate rose by 3.7 percentage points, but by an even larger 5.2 points for African-American families.Key social trends during the Clinton years were strongly positive as well. The teen pregnancy rate (ages 15 to 19) fell by 25% overall and by 29% for Africans-Americans, while births in that age group declined by 21% overall, and by 30% for African-Africans. The abortion rate for the 15-19 age group fell by 28% for African-Americans and by 32% overall.Meanwhile, American communities became safer places to live. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, during the Clinton presidency Americans as a whole became 54% less likely--and African-Americans 57% less likely--to be victims of violent crimes other than homicide, and the probability that African-Americans would be either homicide victims or perpetrators fell by nearly half.To be sure, some aspects of the Clinton agenda remain controversial within the African-American community--none more than the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This lengthy and complex legislation expanded the death penalty to cover drug-trafficking crimes; added 50 new federal offenses (among them a federal ""three strikes and you're out"" law); made drug testing mandatory for those on probation for federal crimes; provided nearly $10 billion for prison construction while eliminating federal funding for inmate education; and financed the hiring of 100,000 additional police officers.Given today's debate on criminal justice, some may be surprised to discover that two-thirds of the Congressional Black Caucus voted in favor of the bill. They may be even more surprised to learn that this vote represented the culmination of decades of advocacy by African-American leaders for tougher law-and-order policies.Consider the passage in 1986 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act that toughened federal mandatory-minimum-sentencing law for drug offenders (including those caught with marijuana) and established a 100-1 disparity in punishments for crack cocaine compared with the powdered form of the drug.The Congressional Black Caucus supported the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, and most African-American members of the House co-sponsored it. In his signing remarks, President Reagan singled out Rep. Charles Rangel among the handful of congressional leaders on the bill. Two years later, President Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Control Act, which toughened narcotics penalties, imposed the death penalty for certain drug-related crimes and established the office headed by the ""drug czar."" Of the 15 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who participated in the final vote on the bill, 10 supported it.Americans across partisan, ideological and racial lines now are rethinking the country's sentencing policies and police practices. This is entirely appropriate--and necessary. But it is worth remembering that, as so often happens, today's problems are in part the product of yesterday's solutions. No one, not even presidential candidates, should be judged by past commitments made in very different circumstances.By overwhelmingly supporting Hillary Clinton despite the changed climate for criminal-justice reform, African-Americans are signaling their willingness to make such distinctions. Unless Bernie Sanders, who voted for the 1994 act as well as several other tough-on-crime bills in the 1990s, can find another way of driving a wedge between Mrs. Clinton and her African-American supporters, he has little hope of winning his party's nomination.Credit: By William A.

Hillary Clinton Challenges the Gun Lobby; Taking on the NRA marks contrast with her previous campaign and rival Bernie Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772010231?accountid=12768,"DURHAM, N. C.--Hillary Clinton is making gun violence a central theme of her campaign, becoming the first leading presidential candidate to directly confront the National Rifle Association without the cover of a hunting license.She is holding town halls with a group known as the Mothers of the Movement, composed of mothers of victims of ""gun violence, police and racially charged incidents,"" including Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager fatally shot by a white neighborhood-watch volunteer in 2012.In Ohio, six leaders of the group, all of whom lost children in high-profile shootings or police altercations, are set to campaign on her behalf again this weekend in Akron, Cleveland and Columbus, ahead of Tuesday's Democratic primary.""She's the only candidate trying to do something about gun violence,"" said Gwen Carr, whose son, Eric Garner, died in New York in police custody in 2014. ""People are beginning to understand that this is a real grave situation.""The former secretary of state's confrontational stance toward the NRA is a shift from her first presidential run, and it could encourage candidates running for Congress or state legislative positions to follow.In 2008, she tried to ease gun owners' concerns by associating with them, much as her male counterparts have done in the past. While the men often talked about hunting trips or pose in camouflage, Mrs. Clinton shared her memories of learning to shoot a gun when she was a child.Mrs. Clinton's calculation is that attitudes toward expanded background checks and new regulation of gun-show sales have changed enough in the aftermath of a succession of mass shootings to lower the political risks.Yet her positions are already drawing the ire of the NRA, an organization with more than five million single-issue voters who are renowned for punishing politicians who cross them--including presidential candidates.""She lies about the issue in a way to make it seem reasonable, to really advance a radical gun-control agenda,"" said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker, who accused Mrs. Clinton of oversimplifying a complex set of laws and exploiting victims of gun violence.If Mrs. Clinton wins the nomination, the showdown over guns could influence the outcome in several critical swing states won by President Barack Obama in 2012 that also have pro-gun constituencies, including Colorado, New Hampshire and Virginia.Mrs. Clinton touts in her stump speech the fact that she is challenging the gun lobby, knitting it into her broad pitch that she, as president, will be the champion of those who feel helpless in the face of big corporations, government and cultural mores.""I will take on the gun lobby,"" she said to a packed gymnasium at Durham's Hillside High School on Thursday. She pledged to fight special interests in Washington, including Wall Street and pharmaceutical companies. ""But you know what the strongest lobby is? It's the gun lobby, which intimidates people, threatens elected officials.""It is time my friends, we stand together and say enough,"" she said. ""I stand with the families of Sandy Hook,"" she added, referring to a 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults.Registered voters overall are more concerned the government would go too far in restricting gun rights, 52%, than fail to do enough to regulate access to firearms, at 44%, a December Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll found. But the survey also showed a deep partisan divide, with 74% of Democratic primary voters saying they were worried government would do too little and 73% of Republicans worried the government would do too much.That partisan edge makes the issue a useful foil in Mrs. Clinton's primary battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has tried both distancing himself from and explaining his own record on guns, which includes voting to prevent gun makers from being held liable for products they sell.Mr. Sanders, who represents a pro-gun state and who only recently became a Democrat, has highlighted his ""D- minus"" rating with the NRA in some debates. In a March 6 debate in Michigan he took a different tack, casting his vote in free-market, economic terms.""If they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you are really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America,"" Mr. Sanders said.His response prompted an NRA tweet saying he was ""spot-on"" in his argument.The Sanders campaign didn't immediately respond to request for comment.Crimes involving guns have been trending down for years, yet highly publicized mass killings are on the rise.A Federal Bureau of Investigation study found an average of 16.4 active-shooter incidents a year between 2007 and 2013, up from an average of 6.4 a year from 2000 to 2006.Activists on both sides of the gun issue agree the political climate shifted significantly after the Newtown shooting.""Everything changed after Newtown,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied gun issues. ""Everybody thinks nothing's changed since no new federal laws were enacted, but the politics have changed a lot.""After that shooting, a gun-safety group co-founded by then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg combined with another organization to form Everytown for Gun Safety, which focused on influencing elections rather than changing congressional policy, spokeswoman Erika Soto Lamb said.""For a long time, there was only the gun lobby,"" Ms. Soto Lamb said. ""There was only the NRA and no organized effort on the other side. Now there's a counterbalance.""In November, Jeremy McPike had Everytown's backing when he won a Virginia state Senate seat in a suburban Washington district that is adjacent to the NRA's Fairfax headquarters.""It once was a cardinal sin to talk about guns in Virigina,"" Mr. McPike said. ""But it's the right message when you can fight for common sense.""While Mr. McPike won, the NRA takes some credit for helping to defeat Everytown's other Virginia state Senate candidate in a Richmond-based district.""The majority of Americans support the Second Amendment, and people who support the Second Amendment vote,"" the NRA's Ms. Baker said.Mrs. Clinton frequently acknowledges that it will be difficult to strengthen gun laws in Congress.""I know the politics are hard,"" she said recently at the Columbia meeting with the mothers of the movement in February. ""But we can't go on like this.""In rural Kingstree, S.C., Ben McGill, a retired military law enforcement officer, pressed Mrs. Clinton at a recent town hall on what she could actually accomplish.Mr. McGill said he was frustrated with gun violence in his small town and elsewhere, as his elderly aunt and uncle had been injured in a shooting last month in Baltimore.Mr. McGill said in an interview that his relatives were on the mend, and he thinks Mrs. Clinton's focus on guns worth a try. ""Everything is possible,"" Mr. McGill said. ""It may be a difficult path, but it's doable.""Corrections & Amplifications: In a speech, Hillary Clinton made reference to a 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults.

"U.S. Election Turmoil Fuels Economic Uncertainty, WSJ Survey Says; More than 80% of economists see downside risks to economy if Trump or Sanders elected, survey says",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771957483?accountid=12768,"Try making an accurate economic forecast for 2017 when the U.S. president could be anyone from Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump.Just as the 2016 race has stymied political prognosticators, it is also confounding economists. More than three-fourths of forecasters in a new Wall Street Journal survey say the presidential election has introduced more uncertainty than is typical from a change at the White House.Markets rebounded over the past month as economic reports bolstered the case that continued--though moderate--economic growth seems likely. The average survey respondent estimates the economy will grow about 2.4% this year and next and that the unemployment rate will fall to 4.6% in 2017.Related* Explore the Survey* More Economists See Fed Waiting Until June to Raise Rates* Economists See a Slight Decline in the Still-Elevated Odds of U.S. RecessionA new president promising dramatic and immediate changes could quickly upend that.""It's stunning to me the markets aren't more worried about it,"" said Diane Swonk, founder of DS Economics, an economic risk-management firm. The rhetoric on the campaign trail is full of ""pretty startling stuff -- isolationism, nationalism, reduced trade flows. We know what that does economically.""The average survey respondent in February's WSJ survey saw 2.3% growth and employment at 4.7%.The business, financial and academic economists in the survey say they are particularly alarmed by the rhetoric coming from insurgent campaigns of real estate tycoon Donald Trump, who is leading the Republican field, and Bernie Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist senator from Vermont who, though he has gathered fewer delegates than Hillary Clinton, continues to win states in the Democratic primary.More than four-fifths of economists rate the possible election of either Mr. Sanders or Mr. Trump as an outcome that may force them to lower their economic forecasts. About half the survey's respondents rate them as ""significant"" risks.Indeed, part of the appeal of Messrs. Trump and Sanders to voters is that they've rejected the orthodox approach that Washington has typically taken toward economics. Many voters are aiming to disrupt this status quo. In turn, economists don't know what to make of proposals to curtail trade, sharply restrict immigration or dramatically overhaul the tax code.""The uncertainty is so great that it is hard to know how to react to it,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a firm that specializes in forecasting high-frequency economic data, Federal Reserve policies, and the amount of debt the Treasury will issue.The Wall Street Journal surveyed 64 economists from March 4 to March 8, though not every one answered every question. Their current economic forecasts aren't all rosy: On average they see about a 20% risk of recession in the next year, down slightly from 21% in the previous survey. They forecast the economy will be too fragile for the Federal Reserve to raise rates before June. They predict the economy will add fewer jobs this year than in 2014 and 2015.The respondents work for businesses, research firms, trade associations, universities and financial institutions both large and small. Their common bond is they are rewarded for accurate forecasts.They believe their task would be easiest with the election of Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A plurality of respondents don't see forecasting risks if these candidates are elected.A plurality of economists rated Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) as posing ""somewhat"" but not a ""significant"" risk if he assumes office. While Mr. Cruz embraces many standard Republican policies, he also led an insurrection that closed the government for several weeks in 2013 and that many believe harmed the economy.Regardless of who wins, some forecasters believe the economy will be little changed next year, as macroeconomic policies take time to work their way into the economy and as many big changes must go through Congress before being enacted.""Presidents cannot change policy quickly enough to affect 2017,"" said Ram Bhagavatula, an economist at fund manager Combinatorics Capital.""Congress will do little no matter who is elected,"" said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.Many of the dramatic changes being proposed in the campaign would reshape the economy in myriad ways if they were ever enacted, confounding forecasts even for people who believe they're the right policy.Economists generally believe free trade raises economic growth, for example, explaining their trepidation around Messrs. Trump and Sanders, who have pledged to roll back trade deals. But even an economist who believes tariffs would protect domestic employment also must account for an increase in inflation due to higher import prices. Even if one believed reversing immigration would help the economy, it would certainly shrink the size of the U.S. labor force.Regardless of politics, it is difficult to puzzle through all the economic implications.Uncertainty over what will happen come November can be damaging to the economy, too. Higher uncertainty may lead businesses to be unsure where to invest and may dent consumer sentiment, too.About a third of respondents believe uncertainty surrounding the election is already having ""somewhat"" negative effects.""The issue is that many candidates are 'talking down' the economy, affecting confidence,"" said Thomas Costerg, senior economist for the British bank Standard Chartered.Write to Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.comCredit: By Josh Zumbrun",3/11/16
Hillary Clinton Stops Short of Ruling Out Wall Street Aides; Former secretary of state has been on the defensive from attacks by Bernie Sanders for her close ties to Wall Street,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771783998?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday said she would work to ""end the revolving door"" between Washington and Wall Street--but stopped short of ruling out continuing her party's recent tradition of turning to the financial industry for Treasury secretaries.""I think it's important also to look at what we want to accomplish,"" said the former secretary of state, during her debate with her challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.She then went on to boast of what she considered the economic success during the administration of her husband, President Bill Clinton, during the 1990s, a time when Mr. Clinton relied heavily on Wall Street officials to staff his administration.Mrs. Clinton was asked during the Miami debate whether she agreed with criticism from liberals in her party that her husband and President Barack Obama had ""relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks""--in particular that three of their last four Treasury secretaries had ties to Citigroup Inc.""I do agree that we have to end the revolving door,"" Mrs. Clinton said, adding that she supports a bill introduced last year by Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, called The Financial Services Conflict of Interest Act.That bill, co-sponsored by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren--one of the leading liberal critics of Wall Street--would ban government workers from accepting bonuses from former employers when entering government, and would extend the period they would need to wait to lobby government after leaving office. But it wouldn't ban outright the entrance of financial services officials from entering government jobs.Mrs. Clinton's comments come as she has been on the defensive from attacks by Mr. Sanders for her close ties to Wall Street. And there has been extensive speculation among her finance-industry backers whether the Wall Street-bashing tone of the Democratic campaign would make it hard for her, if she were to win the presidency, to follow her husband and Mr. Obama in tapping big banks for her top economic positions.Her carefully calibrated comments Wednesday night would seem to leave the door open.During the debate ahead of next Tuesday's Florida primary contest, Mrs. Clinton pledged to appoint individuals who would put the ""interests of consumers"" first and those who will ""do more to make sure Main Street flourishes.""Liberal Democrats, particularly Ms. Warren, have criticized the Obama administration repeatedly for nominating a number of Wall Street alumni to high posts at the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve, arguing it sends the wrong message about giving financial institutions too much influence over policy.The current Treasury Secretary, Jacob Lew, had worked at Citigroup, as had Nathan Sheets, who heads the department's highest international position. Mr. Obama also tapped Stanley Fischer, another former Citigroup executive, to serve as the Fed's vice chairman.Mrs. Clinton said she would ""very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including to Sen. Warren.""Throughout the two-hour debate, Mrs. Clinton was once again pressed to defend herself for giving paid speeches to, and taking contributions from, the financial industry, raising questions about her ability to be tough on the biggest banks.""Look, clearly, clearly, the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions,"" Mr. Sanders said sarcastically.Mr. Sanders continued that he was proud that "" the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now, he didn't give me $225,000 for speaking fees, he said I was dangerous and he's right. I am dangerous for Wall Street.""Write to Donna Borak at donna.borak@wsj.comCredit: By Donna Borak",3/11/16

Bernie Sanders faced off Wednesday, a day after he scored a crucial win in the Michigan presidential primary, sparring over immigration and making direct appeals to Latino voters ahead of next week's contest in Florida.The Democratic contenders delved into the details of immigration law, invoking long-ago votes and critiquing the intricacies of each other's record. Mr. Sanders reflected on his immigrant heritage, and both candidates cited spots in the other's record that are out of step with Latino voters and immigration rights activists.Mrs. Clinton was questioned about the right way to handle the influx of Central American children at the southern border. Mr. Sanders was under fire for his opposition to the 2007 immigration bill that would have legalized people in the U.S. illegally.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Hillary Clinton Widens Delegate Lead, but Bernie Sanders Shows Strength* Sanders Coalition Shows Strength in Michigan* Capital Journal: Angry White Males Propel Donald Trump--and Bernie Sanders* Tenor of Campaign Takes a Toll: WSJ/NBC Poll* Democrats Draw a Diverse Voting Pool in Exit Polls* Clinton's Lead Over Sanders Narrows Slightly in WSJ/NBC Poll* Michigan Turnout Shows Split on ClintonUnder aggressive questioning from Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, Mrs. Clinton promised not to deport children who are already living in the U.S., and to target for deportation criminals and those who pose a risk. Mr. Sanders also pledged not to send children away.But the former secretary of state stuck to her position that children newly entering the country illegally should be sent back if they don't meet qualifications for asylum or other programs that would allow them to stay legally.The eighth Democratic presidential debate yielded few revelations, often covering well-trod ground. Although the candidates disagreed sharply on several issues, their tone was less combative than in Sunday's match-up in Michigan, in part because several of the questions came from audience members.Mrs. Clinton was pressed to explain why many voters still have doubts about whether they can trust her. In Michigan, about 60% of voters said they viewed Mrs. Clinton as honest and trustworthy, compared with 80% who said the same of Mr. Sanders, according to ABC exit polls. In Mississippi, where Mrs. Clinton won 82% of the vote, 75% said Mrs. Clinton was trustworthy, compared with 70% for Mr. Sanders.""Obviously, it's painful for me to hear that, and I do take responsibility,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""When you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility.""She said that would work to demonstrate that people could count on her, adding that she's not a natural politician like her husband or President Barack Obama.For his part, Mr. Sanders tried to clarify the difference between an ""establishment politician,"" which he has dubbed Mrs. Clinton, and a ""career politician"" like himself. He said the difference is what he has focused his career on, citing his independence from Wall Street and the pharmaceutical and fossil fuel industries.""You've got to look at what the career is about,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""This is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country.""During the immigration discussion, the candidates were asked a question by a woman who identified herself as a Guatemalan immigrant whose husband, the father of her children, had been deported. She asked the candidates what they would do to stop deportations and reunite families. Mrs. Clinton praised the woman for having the ""courage"" to ask the question and called for more Americans to hear such stories so they could learn the ""human cost"" of deportation policies.Mrs. Clinton also took several opportunities to refocus the discussion on Mr. Sanders's 2007 vote against the comprehensive immigration bill.""Our best chance was in 2007 when [the late Sen.] Ted Kennedy led the charge,"" she said. ""I voted for that bill. Sen. Sanders voted against it.""Mr. Sanders has said during this campaign that he opposed the bill because a guest worker program included was akin to slavery. But the debate moderators showed a video of him from the time, where he cites concerns that the new workers will drive down wages.Mr. Sanders replied that he worked to improve the program and was able to support the 2013 version of the bill.Mrs. Clinton shot back with a list of immigrant advocates who backed the 2007 version, saying they never would have supported ""modern slavery."" ""That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill,"" she said.Mrs. Clinton also pointed to two 2006 votes Mr. Sanders cast while he was in the House, running for the Senate. One would have allowed the indefinite detention of immigrants pending deportation. The second was a largely symbolic measure meant to protect the Minutemen, a self-styled, private patrol that aimed to prevent illegal crossings on the southern border.Mr. Sanders didn't respond directly to the assertion on indefinite detentions. He said the Minuteman bill simply ""codified existing legislation.""During Wednesday's debate, both candidates declined to label GOP front-runner Donald Trump a ""racist"" in response to a direct question about his references to Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers.Still, they hurled several other criticisms Mr. Trump's way. Mrs. Clinton attacked his ""trafficking in prejudice and paranoia,"" and said, to loud applause, ""You don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great."" She added that she had been the first to call out Mr. Trump, saying that when he began with the offensive rhetoric, she said ""basta.""Mr. Sanders recalled Mr. Trump's efforts in the so-called birther movement to ""delegitimize the president.""He noted that his own father was born in Poland, yet ""nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate,"" and that was probably because of the ""color of my skin.""""The American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans,"" he said.The debate came on the heels of Mr. Sanders's unexpected, narrow win in Michigan , a victory that provided him with a burst of momentum and all but guaranteed that the Democratic primary wouldn't end anytime soon.Now, Democrats are bracing for a prolonged fight that could stretch through the spring and into early summer.As Mr. Sanders tried to make the most of his moment, calling his Michigan win a ""major political"" upset, Mrs. Clinton sought to reassert herself as the front-runner. She retains a commanding lead in pledged delegates.Mrs. Clinton, faced with questions about her use of a private email server during her time as secretary state, said: ""I made a mistake,"" adding that ""it wasn't prohibited.""Mrs. Clinton's records management during her tenure at the State Department has spawned lawsuits, a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry, an internal State Department probe, an intelligence community review and congressional inquiries.During the debate, Mrs. Clinton dismissed questions about whether she would end her campaign if investigations into her records eventually resulted in an indictment. ""Oh, for goodness--I'm not even answering that question,"" Mrs. Clinton said.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Laura Meckler and Rebecca Ballhaus",3/11/16
Democrats Settle in for Long Presidential Contest; Clinton's delegate lead grows even as Sanders wins Michigan; Trump aims for quick end to Republican race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771628860?accountid=12768,"MIAMI--Sen. Bernie Sanders's upset win in Michigan this week left Democrats bracing for a long and costly primary fight and another round of split decisions in five contests next week.The first post-Michigan showdown between front-runner Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders came at the eighth Democratic debate here Wednesday evening, aimed at a Latino audience, where they challenged each other's records on immigration, education and jobs.Mrs. Clinton had to defend the government's handling of the 2014 influx of Central American children at the southern border, while Mr. Sanders was under fire for his opposition to a 2007 bill to rewrite immigration laws.While Florida is friendlier territory for Mrs. Clinton, the Vermont senator hopes to build on his narrow victory in Michigan, riding his populist economic and trade themes into neighboring industrial states Ohio and Illinois, which hold primaries Tuesday.Still, while Mr. Sanders has both money and momentum, Hillary Clinton has math on her side. The former secretary of state extended her commanding delegate lead Tuesday after minimizing her Michigan loss while trouncing her Democratic rival in Mississippi. She now has 1,221 delegates, more than half the number needed to secure the nomination; Mr. Sanders has 571.As Democrats settle in for a long haul reminiscent of the 2008 primary, the Republican contest could be nearing its conclusion if Donald Trump prevails next week in Ohio and Florida, two winner-take-all contests that could give the businessman an insurmountable delegate lead.The prospect of a protracted battle for the Democratic nomination and sooner-than-expected end to the GOP contest underscores the unpredictability of this election cycle. At the start of the year, most political experts were predicting reverse paths to the party's presidential nominations, with Clinton expected to dominate her race while a crowded field of Republicans slugged it out.""It's a big win,"" Tad Devine, a senior strategist for the Sanders campaign, said of the Michigan victory that slowed Mrs. Clinton's momentum. ""It's going to give a lot of people who weren't sure that Bernie could really prevail in this process a lot of hope that he will.""On Tuesday, Democratic primary voters will cast ballots in North Carolina, Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio.Mr. Sanders's aides are taking a realistic approach that aims to maximize his delegate haul in states he has his best chances of winning. That means, for instance, that Florida may be beyond their reach since independents can't participate, said Mr. Devine.Broad support from those unaffiliated voters helped Mr. Sanders win Michigan, while Mrs. Clinton won among registered Democrats. Also, the state allows early voting, meaning many Florida Democrats cast ballots before Mr. Sanders picked up new momentum with victory this week.Illinois and Ohio present better opportunities; both have more flexible rules regarding independent-voter participation in party primaries. In addition, Mr. Sanders's opposition to trade agreements is likely to resonate in those states.Michigan was the first big, industrialized northern state to weigh in on the primary. Its median household income of $49,000 and percentage of people who are 25 and older with a bachelor's degree, 26%, are in line with those in Ohio and Illinois. The states also have deep roots and history in blue-collar manufacturing.Though Mr. Sanders's message proved potent, Clinton advisers said they don't plan a major course change. They will work to highlight Mrs. Clinton's views on trade and her plans to create better-paying jobs.""We're going to have to work even harder to amplify Secretary Clinton's economic argument,"" said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.The bigger concern for the Clinton campaign is the extension of a nomination race that they remain convinced she will ultimately win because of her lead in the delegate count.A long contest costs a lot of money, and she will continue to have to guard against Mr. Sanders's attempts to press her to embrace his more liberal positions, which the Clinton campaign worries would hurt her in the general election.""From the beginning, we have approached this nomination contest as a battle for delegates,"" Mr. Mook said. ""So, while Sen. Sanders has placed big bets on pulling out wins in certain individual states, we have sought to compete everywhere in every state with the goal of amassing the most delegates possible.""Much like the Democratic presidential campaign in 2008, this race now could stretch into the early summer. In that campaign, Mrs. Clinton won 23 contests before eventually conceding to then-Sen. Barack Obama.Bill Burton, a Democratic strategist and former Obama aide, said Mrs. Clinton's Michigan speed bump reminded him of Mrs. Clinton's come-from-behind victory in New Hampshire in 2008 that caught the Obama campaign by surprise.At the time, top Obama advisers remained focused on methodically executing a plan focused on amassing delegates. He said Mrs. Clinton's campaign was wise to do the same this year.Dan Pfeiffer, a senior aide on the Obama 2008 campaign, said there are similarities between the situation Mrs. Clinton finds herself in now and that of Mr. Obama in 2008, but her delegate lead is larger than his was at a similar point in the race.""The math made it virtually impossible for Clinton to catch Obama at this point in '08 and the same is true now. Everything that happens from this point on is interesting, but it is not particularly instructive,"" he said.Democratic strategist Mark Mellman said that, as in 2008, this Democratic race will be close and hard fought, but ""it's not going be as close and it's not going to be as hard fought.""Though the delegate math looks daunting for Mr. Sanders, his campaign advisers say he can close the gap. For one, the superdelegates, who are party officials and elected leaders, now backing Mrs. Clinton may switch allegiances if she loses their states.""If you want to be the nominee of your party you not only have to win early you have to win often,"" Mr. Devine said. ""You cannot go on a losing streak and expect that all the people, especially the superdelegates who've come to you in droves, are going to stay with you in droves.""Dante Chinni contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",3/11/16
Hillary's Michigan Droop; Bernie Sanders's upset shows Clinton's campaign weakness.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771616612?accountid=12768,"Progressive journalists and other sophisticates are gloating about the turmoil Donald Trump has fomented within the Republican Party, and they'd better enjoy the feeling while it lasts. Hillary Clinton's thunderclap defeat in the Michigan primary shows the Democrats are saddled with a weak candidate who has a sack load of political liabilities as heavy as Mr. Trump's.Bernie Sanders's 50% to 48% triumph is one of the more remarkable upsets since the dawn of political polling. The final Real Clear Politics polling average gave Mrs. Clinton a 21.4-percentage-point lead in the state, and no poll taken in the last month gave her less than an 11-point advantage. Michigan is a hard state to survey, but no poll has a 25-point margin of error.Such late swings don't happen unless pollsters miscalculate the size and composition of the electorate, which suggests either a Sanders surge or a slow-motion collapse in Mrs. Clinton's rank-and-file support. It's likely both, which exposes the underlying enervation in Hillary World.The Vermont socialist campaigned hard against trade and the economic status quo, and according to exit polls he beat Mrs. Clinton 56% to 40% among voters ""very worried"" about the economy. For the first time he also cut into her lead among African-Americans. She won blacks 9 to 1 in Mississippi, a pattern that has emerged across the South.Her margin was 2 to 1 in Michigan, which is commanding. But Mr. Sanders showed he can peel off enough of this core constituency to win a state and expand the diversity of his coalition beyond white liberals and young people. Imagine if Hillary had won over enough Phish drum circles to carry Burlington, Vt.Democrats allocate their delegates proportionately, and the brutal math is that Mr. Sanders must win primaries by much larger average margins than 2% to close his current deficit. Still, his people's revolution could embarrass Mrs. Clinton again next week in other industrial Midwest states like Ohio and Illinois.Mrs. Clinton's Wolverine State loss also revealed the resistance and apathy that are her campaign bodyguards. Mr. Sanders beat her by 4 to 1 among people who wanted an ""honest and trustworthy"" nominee and edged her out among those who said they favored a president who ""cares about people like me.""On the stump, Mrs. Clinton seems to take it for granted that she has the race sewn up. She is the anti-inspiring placeholder for the Democratic machine of unions, feminists, the green lobby and minorities that want to hold on to power after President Obama. But voters rarely like to be told to take their medicine: Democracy is supposed to be at least a little raucous and disorganized.All of this explains why John Kasich and Marco Rubio beat her handily in the polling on November matchups, and even Ted Cruz comes close. Democrats take solace that the GOP will nominate Donald Trump, who loses to Mrs. Clinton in nearly all surveys. But they shouldn't be too confident.In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 67% of registered voters say they couldn't support Mr. Trump--but 56% say they couldn't vote for Mrs. Clinton. Some 51% of voters view Mrs. Clinton negatively, by far the highest share since her husband ran in 1992. Mr. Trump could be a disaster for Republicans, but he also is less well known as a political actor and so has more upside if he ever decides to act like a President. Mrs. Clinton has been around so long that she will have a hard time changing perceptions.The truth is that both parties are on the cusp of nominating candidates who are disliked by large swaths of the public. A Clinton-Trump matchup would quickly become a brutal race to the bottom, if we're not there already, and at the end somebody has to be President. In a year when anything can happen, and has, Trump Schadenfreude could become Clinton buyer's remorse.",3/11/16

On Tuesday her coronation was interrupted by the voters of Michigan, who handed Bernie Sanders a surprising victory in the state's Democratic primary. According to exit polls the Vermont senator won 30% of the black vote, enough to score a breakthrough win in the big, diverse state. Given his remarkable fundraising prowess--last month he raked in $42 million compared to Mrs. Clinton's $30 million--and the possibility she will be indicted, it's still too early to call the Democratic race.Mrs. Clinton did win in Mississippi last night, powered by her usual overwhelming support from black voters. Why are African-American Democrats so enamored of Mrs. Clinton? Our columnist William Galston says it's because blacks thrived during her husband's presidency . ""During Mr. Clinton's eight years in office, median household income rose to $57,700 from $50,700, a sturdy 14%. Among African-Americans, it rose by even more, to $40,800 from $31,000--32%. While the overall poverty rate fell by 3.5 percentage points, it fell for African-Americans by 10.9 points, the most since the 1960s...""""The conventional wisdom on the left is that the GOP brought the Trump phenomenon on itself,"" writes Jason Riley . Media pundits like to pretend that the party has been stoking anti-immigrant sentiment, but Mr. Riley notes that Mr. Trump ""wasn't really invited to this party. He crashed it . And judging from the primary election results so far--he's winning pluralities, not majorities--most Republicans want him to leave .""From the campaign trail in Florida, the Journal's Allysia Finley reports , ""The Trump disciples I encounter aren't angry so much as they are agitated by what they perceive to be America's fall from greatness. They complain about the country's slow-growing economy, aimless leaders, lawless government and uncontrolled southwestern border . And they sincerely believe that only Mr. Trump can fix these problems.""Whether or not he could fix them, he would certainly enjoy significant authority. Our columnist Holman Jenkins points out that ""contrary to what you may have read elsewhere, President Trump would have considerable power to provoke trade wars to create an instant opportunity for his negotiating acumen.""Yet surprisingly, Mr. Trump's 10-paragraph health plan released last week includes an ""endorsement of foreign pharmaceutical importation,"" notes a Journal editorial . ""His campaign promises to 'remove barriers to entry into free markets,' because 'allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.'""A separate editorial observes that ""the U.S. has decided to sanction Chinese telecom giant ZTE for trade violations with Iran. This provides reason to hope that at last the Obama Administration may also crack down on Chinese firms benefiting from other illicit conduct such as cybertheft .""And in case you haven't been keeping up with the gender politics of ice , you may wish to delve into a new study on a ""feminist glaciology framework for global environmental change research ,"" which was naturally funded with your tax dollars.Credit: By James Freeman",3/11/16
"Primaries Test Bernie Sanders's Strength Against Hillary Clinton in Large, Diverse States; Democratic contests in Michigan and Mississippi could be among Sanders's last, best chances to slow Clinton's momentum",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771301971?accountid=12768,"Tuesday's Democratic primaries in Michigan and Mississippi kick off a pivotal stretch for Sen. Bernie Sanders that will test whether he can win large, diverse states and keep within striking distance of Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination.Lagging far behind Mrs. Clinton in the battle to accumulate pledged delegates, the Vermont senator comes to Tuesday's contests needing to show strength as the race turns toward the industrial Midwest. The primaries Tuesday, and five more contests next week, could prove to be Mr. Sanders's last, best chance to slow Mrs. Clinton's momentum and salvage his candidacy.Mr. Sanders has notched wins in eight of the first 20 Democratic contests, but his victories generally have come in small states with overwhelmingly white electorates or that use a caucus format that attracts grass roots activists, who have migrated to his campaign.The result is a commanding lead for Mrs. Clinton in the tally of pledged delegates.Though the stakes in Michigan are particularly high for Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton is under pressure to show strength outside the South, where strong support from African-American voters has propelled most of her victories.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Hillary Clinton's Lead Over Bernie Sanders Narrows Slightly in WSJ/NBC Poll* Michigan Turnout Shows Split on Clinton* What to Watch in Tuesday's Nominating ContestsA win in Michigan this week or in Ohio or Florida next Tuesday could help Mr. Sanders chip away at that margin and make the argument that he can win in states that hold traditional primaries and that have ethnically diverse populations.Losses in those states, on the other hand, would solidify Mrs. Clinton's position as the de facto nominee.A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed the Democratic race tightening nationally, with Mrs. Clinton's lead over Mr. Sanders narrowing to nine points among Democratic primary voters. In February, the former secretary of state led by 11 points, and in January, she led by 24 points, according to the poll.Gaining ground in national polls will mean little, though, if Mr. Sanders can't secure wins in more diverse and delegate-rich states, said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist who is backing Mrs. Clinton.""The fundamental problem that Sanders has is that he has not proven he can win in the diversity of the Democratic Party,"" Mr. Elmendorf said. ""On March 15, you're in four large, diverse states that seem hard for him to win. After that, I just don't see what the path is.""The Sanders game plan is to notch a win in Michigan that would reverberate in a pair of Midwestern states that vote on March 15: Ohio and Illinois, Sanders aides said.""There are similarities between Michigan and parts of Ohio and Illinois that have experienced high levels of deindustrialization due to policies that Secretary Clinton has supported over and over again,"" said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager.That line of attack has been taken by Mr. Sanders himself, highlighting Mrs. Clinton's early support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Pacific Rim nations and for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by her husband, Bill Clinton, in the 1990s.The Sanders campaign made a big bet on Michigan, airing TV ads in the state for the past three weeks, and Mr. Sanders has made multiple trips to the state.The senator has expended limited resources in several states that Mrs. Clinton won by wide margins, essentially ceding swaths of the South to his Democratic rival. But the Vermont senator's campaign has long targeted Michigan as a key battleground, predicting a ""showdown"" there and counting on the state to serve as a launchpad to next week's primaries.At the polls Tuesday in Ferndale, Mich., voters split between the two Democratic candidates. Elizabeth and Gerald Collins both backed Mrs. Clinton.""I think she has the best chance to win,"" Mrs. Collins, 51, said. ""I like where she stands on many of the issues.""Mr. Collins, 58, said he believes people just aren't ready yet for Mr. Sanders and his ideas.But Josh Hartwig, 29, disagreed, casting his vote for Mr. Sanders because he supports the ""common man.""Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned aggressively across Michigan in recent days. The former secretary of state made the Flint water crisis a central campaign issue, and she revived the debate about the 2009 bailout of the auto industry , highlighting Mr. Sanders's vote against legislation that rescued auto makers and shored up the nation's banks.""If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it,"" Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Sanders during their debate on Sunday.Clinton campaign officials have long argued the Democratic nomination would be decided in March. And after scoring eight victories on Super Tuesday and winning Louisiana, the biggest prize this past weekend, the former secretary of state entered Tuesday's primaries well positioned to continue to build on her delegate lead. The goal, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has said, is to compete everywhere and methodically amass delegates, making it mathematically impossible for Mr. Sanders to catch up.The Sanders campaign believes the race is still winnable, saying the map gets more favorable from here. The calendar was ""front-loaded"" with Southern states loyal to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, formerly the Arkansas governor, Mr. Weaver said.""Secretary Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas for many years,"" he said. ""Her base is in the South and she's done very, very well in the South.""The good news, as far as the Sanders campaign is concerned, is that the road ahead is heavy on contests in the north and the west.Before Michigan began counting votes in its primary Tuesday, the Democratic contenders already turned their attention to the next big prizes in their presidential race, with Hillary Clinton skipping over to Ohio and Bernie Sanders headed to Florida.With next week's Florida primary in their sights, the Democratic presidential campaigns held dueling conference calls over which candidate would be best for the Latino community.The Sanders campaign has been on the defense because of the Vermont senator's 2007 opposition to a comprehensive immigration bill that would have provided undocumented immigrants with a path to citizenship.""It is clear Hillary is the only one we can trust to lead 12 million people out of the shadows,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., Ill.), told reporters on a call organized by the Clinton campaign.Mr. Sanders's campaign sought to broaden the subject beyond immigration to who best understands and would improve the lives of Latino voters.Mr. Weaver, the Sanders campaign manager, said the Vermont senator is the ""son of an immigrant himself, who came to this country not speaking English, who saw firsthand and lived firsthand the experience of immigrant communities.""Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",3/11/16
"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Clash in Flint Democratic Debate; Sparks fly over auto bailout and trade at seventh Democratic presidential debate, held in Michigan",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770799302?accountid=12768,"FLINT, Mich.--The Democratic presidential contenders clashed sharply over economic policy in a debate Sunday , with front-runner Hillary Clinton attacking rival Bernie Sanders for his opposition to a federal auto bailout and Mr. Sanders charging that Clinton-backed trade deals had helped destroy American cities like Detroit.Both issues resonate deeply in Michigan, which hosts its presidential primary on Tuesday. The state is home to the large domestic auto makers that benefitted from the 2009 bailout, but it has also lost jobs to trade as companies moved positions overseas.It was their seventh showdown, and the sharpest clash yet, with the candidates repeatedly interrupting one another and accusing each other of hypocrisy. Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates , even after weekend caucus wins for Mr. Sanders in Nebraska , Kansas and Maine . Mrs. Clinton won Saturday's Louisiana primary , which had the biggest delegate count.More on Election 2016* Flint Democratic Presidential Debate--Recap* Democrats Eye Next Fights* Clinton, Sanders Head Into Seventh Democratic Primary Debate* Clinton's Louisiana Win Helps Offset Two Caucus Defeats* Trump Leads Rivals in Michigan, Trails Clinton in General Election Test, Poll Finds* Flint Begins Replacing Lead Pipes* 2016 Election PollsAsked about a possible future confrontation with Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Mrs. Clinton said she would not ""get into the gutter"" with whomever the Republicans nominate and predicted that Mr. Trump's ""bigotry, his bullying, his bluster are not going to wear well on the American people.""The Vermont senator stayed on the offense against Mrs. Clinton. He blasted her record, demanded she release transcripts of her Wall Street speeches and sharply critiqued her husband's record as president in the 1990s.Mr. Sanders has been attacking Mrs. Clinton for days over trade, but Mrs. Clinton's hit on the auto bailout was a potent counter.The assistance for the industry was included in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion measure that is also credited with keeping the nation's financial system from collapsing. The Senate vote to release the second half of those funds came in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration, and auto companies and their backers said the companies would have gone under without that rescue package.""The money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry,"" said Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator. ""I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money.""Mr. Sanders defended his vote, saying he objected to the Wall Street bailout money. He said he wasn't willing to give taxpayer money to those companies because of what he called their own recklessness, greed and illegal behavior.""Let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street,"" he said. ""I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street.""The exchange seemed to surprise Mr. Sanders, and his campaign within minutes sought to soften and clarify his position. Mr. Sanders supported the auto funds but not the Wall Street rescue. Since they couldn't be separated, he opposed the bill.In the debate, Mrs. Clinton replied that leaders have to make tough decisions and that had his side prevailed, the auto industry would have collapsed. And she said the exchange proved her point that Mr. Sanders is a ""one-issue candidate.""Mr. Sanders didn't disagree, but said his ""one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That's my one issue.""Mr. Sanders took an aggressive posture from the start, particularly on her support for some free-trade agreements, such as Nafta, which eased trade rules with Mexico and other nations and was signed by former President Bill Clinton and backed by Mrs. Clinton when she was first lady.""You didn't need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour,"" he said.It was one in a string of attacks on Mr. Clinton's policies. He also went after the Clintons on welfare and Wall Street deregulation legislation that he signed.In each case, Mrs. Clinton replied that ""if we're going to argue about the 1990s,"" then she preferred to talk about that era's robust job creation and broadly rising incomes.On economics, their differences were largely defined by how much support the government should give to American corporations, including the auto bailout but also the Export-Import Bank.Mrs. Clinton went after Mr. Sanders for opposing re-authorization of the bank, which provides financial support to help large and small U.S. companies export their goods. Mr. Sanders said the entire enterprise amounts to ""corporate welfare.""The debate was staged in Flint, a venue pushed by Mrs. Clinton to bring attention to a crisis there where a cost-cutting move wound up poisoning the water supply with lead .Mr. Sanders repeated his call for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to resign, and for the first time, Mrs. Clinton agreed and added that if he doesn't resign, he should be recalled. In the past, Mrs. Clinton has dismissed that political solution as inadequate. She added that more funding as well as accountability from others was needed.In a series of tweets sent during the debate, Mr. Snyder defended his record in Michigan and said he is taking responsibility for the Flint crisis. He outlined some of the steps he has taken to solve the problem, and said it was the result of a ""failure of government at all levels that could be described as a massive error of bureaucracy.""The pair also returned to one of their long-time disputes, tangling over whether gun manufacturers and sellers should be protected from lawsuits.In the past, Mrs. Clinton has hit Mr. Sanders for supporting the 2005 law that provided gun makers legal immunity. In January, Mr. Sanders announced a shift in his views, voicing support for legislation that would remove gun manufacturers' protections from liability.On Sunday, though, Mr. Sanders offered a more nuanced view, suggesting that gun makers should not be held responsible for the actions of those who legally purchase firearms.""What people are saying is that if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""If that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com , Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler, Colleen McCain Nelson and Rebecca Ballhaus",3/11/16

Sanders Puts Emphasis on Delegate Math; Vermont senator's campaign shifts strategy to maximize Democratic delegates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772625054?accountid=12768,"On the eve of a five-state showdown Tuesday Bernie Sanders's campaign has dropped its focus on winning marquee states in favor of scooping up delegates anywhere it can find them, hoping to show he still has a chance of overcoming Hillary Clinton's large lead and capturing the Democratic presidential nomination.Mr. Sanders's shift in strategy is a response to the hard realities of delegate math: Despite an upset victory in Michigan last week that cheered his supporters he is losing ground to Mrs. Clinton and in danger of reaching the point where it is impossible to catch up.Two states where the Sanders campaign concedes he will have a tough time winning Tuesday are Florida and North Carolina. Rather than cede them to Mrs. Clinton and focus on winning a trio of Midwestern states where his prospects are brighter, Mr. Sanders late last week expanded his television advertising in certain Florida and North Carolina markets, his advisers said. The idea is to pluck a few extra delegates in the face of an expected Clinton victory in both states.""The goal Tuesday is to win as many delegates as we can. And if we can win states, too, that's a big plus,"" said Tad Devine, a Sanders campaign strategist. ""Now we have to build a foundation of delegates. A lot of delegates are in play [on Tuesday]. We can get a lot of them, we think. The advertising in some of these [Florida and North Carolina] markets may make the difference.""That is different than the approach Mr. Sanders has taken in the past. When 11 states were up for grabs on March 1, Mr. Sanders did scant advertising and spent little time in Southern states where his rival was favored. He focused instead on capturing a handful of states--including Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma--and demonstrating he could beat Mrs. Clinton outside his home base of New England.But the limitations of targeting a few high-profile states have become clear. Delegates are awarded proportionally based on results and because of Mrs. Clinton's lopsided victories in Southern states she has taken a commanding lead.Take the case of Michigan. For all the attention paid to Mr. Sanders's upset victory there, the tight margins in the race--he won by 1.5 percentage points--meant he netted just seven more pledged delegates than Mrs. Clinton. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton won 26 more delegates than Mr. Sanders in Mississippi, which she won in a landslide. So, when the voting was all done that night, Mr. Sanders won the headline while Mrs. Clinton expanded her lead by 19 delegates.She now has 766 pledged delegates compared with 551 for Mr. Sanders, according to the Associated Press. Add in the ""superdelegates""--Democratic officials free to support whomever they choose--and her lead is 1,231 to 576. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.For Mrs. Clinton, the dynamics are the opposite of what she faced in her 2008 race against then-Sen. Barack Obama. Mr. Obama jumped to a formidable delegate lead in the early going. She was never able to close the gap despite impressive wins in Pennsylvania and other states later in the calendar. Now, Mrs. Clinton is benefiting from the same delegate formulas that were her undoing eight years ago.Tom Nides, a deputy to Mrs. Clinton when she served as secretary of state and now a fundraiser for her campaign, said: ""We're basically following the Obama math in 2008. Obama did well enough in some states and really well in other states and he made the math completely impossible for Hillary to get the nomination.""An analysis by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shows that Mr. Sanders would need to win 61% of the remaining pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates to catch up to Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders said he isn't deterred, noting superdelegates are free to change their minds. They might do just that if they see him winning and come to believe he's the best bet to defeat the Republican nominee--possibly Donald Trump--in the fall, he said.In an appearance Sunday on CNN, Mr. Sanders said ""if we do well in a number of states and if the general sentiment becomes that Bernie Sanders is the candidate who will defeat Donald Trump"" superdelegates might ""swing over"" to his campaign.Polling shows Mrs. Clinton with substantial leads in the three other states that vote on Tuesday: Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll.Privately, both campaigns said they believe the race to be tighter. Mr. Sanders's victory in Michigan underscored the strength of his anti-free trade message, a message likely to resonate in neighboring Ohio and Illinois. He also has sought to energize his supporters and perhaps cut into Mrs. Clinton's lead among African-Americans by taking aim at Chicago's Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel.Mr. Sanders noted that the Chicago mayor has endorsed Mrs. Clinton and said: ""I do not want Mayor Emanuel's endorsement if I win the nomination.""Mrs. Clinton jabbed at Mr. Sanders's record and policy positions, highlighting the Vermont senator's opposition to the auto bailout at a rally in Youngstown and questioning his push for single-payer health care at a church near Cleveland on Sunday. ""I sure don't want to start over like my opponent does,"" Mrs. Clinton said, underscoring her support for the Affordable Care Act.Clinton aides don't expect Mr. Sanders to withdraw any time soon. But some in her circle are eager to move on. Whatever happens on Tuesday, they said they would like Mr. Sanders to forego his attacks on the party front-runner.Alan Patricof, a Clinton fundraiser, said: ""I'm tired of his message."" He added: ""He throws a lot of slings and arrows.""Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",3/14/16
"A New Tool for Avoiding Big-Bank Failures: 'Chapter 14'; Bernie Sanders is right, Dodd-Frank doesn't work, but his solution is wrong. Here's what would work.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772009759?accountid=12768,"For months Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has been telling Americans that the government must ""break up the banks"" because they are ""too big to fail."" This is the wrong role for government, but Sen. Sanders and others on both sides of the aisle have a point. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, which was supposed to end too big to fail, has not.Dodd-Frank gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. authority to take over and oversee the reorganization of so-called systemically important financial institutions whose failure could pose a risk to the economy. But no one can be sure the FDIC will follow its resolution strategy, which leads many to believe Dodd-Frank will be bypassed in a crisis.Reflecting on his own experience as overseer of the U.S. Treasury's bailout program in 2008-09, Neel Kashkari, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, says government officials are once again likely to bail out big banks and their creditors rather than ""trigger many trillions of additional costs to society.""The solution is not to break up the banks or turn them into public utilities. Instead, we should do what Dodd-Frank failed to do: Make big-bank failures feasible without tanking the economy by writing a process to do so into the bankruptcy code through a new amendment--a ""chapter 14.""Chapter 14 would impose losses on shareholders and creditors while preventing the collapse of one firm from spreading to others. It could be initiated by the lead regulatory agency and would begin with an over-the-weekend bankruptcy hearing before a pre-selected U.S. district judge. After the hearing, the court would convert the bank's eligible long-term debt into equity, reorganizing the bankrupt bank's balance sheet without restructuring its operations.A new non-bankrupt company, owned by the bankruptcy estate (the temporary legal owner of a failed company's assets and property), would assume the recapitalized balance sheet of the failed bank, including all obligations to its short-term creditors. But the failed bank's shareholders and long-term bondholders would have claims only against the estate, not the new company.The new firm would take over the bank's business and be led by the bankruptcy estate's chosen private-sector managers. With regulations requiring minimum long-term debt levels, the new firm would be solvent. The bankruptcy would be entirely contained, both because the new bank would keep operating and paying its debts, and because losses would be allocated entirely to the old bank's shareholders and long-term bondholders.An examination by one of us (Emily Kapur) of previously unexplored discovery and court documents from Lehman Brothers' September 2008 bankruptcy shows that chapter 14 would have worked especially well for that firm, without adverse effects on the financial system.Here is how Lehman under chapter 14 would have played out. The process would start with a single, brief hearing for the parent company to facilitate the creation of a new recapitalized company--a hearing in which the judge would have minimal discretion. By contrast, Lehman's actual bankruptcy involved dozens of complex proceedings in the U.S. and abroad, creating huge uncertainty and making it impossible for even part of the firm to remain in business.When Lehman went under it had $20 billion of book equity and $96 billion of long-term debt, while its perceived losses were around $54 billion. If the costs of a chapter 14 proceeding amounted to an additional (and conservative) $10 billion, then the new company would be well capitalized with around $52 billion of equity.The new parent company would take over Lehman's subsidiaries, all of which would continue in business, outside of bankruptcy. And the new company would honor all obligations to short-term creditors, such as repurchase agreement and commercial paper lenders.The result: Short-term creditors would have no reason to run on the bank before the bankruptcy proceeding, knowing they would be protected. And they would have no reason to run afterward, because the new firm would be solvent.Without a run, Lehman would have $30 billion more liquidity after resolution than it had in 2008, easing subsequent operational challenges. In the broader marketplace, money-market funds would have no reason to curtail lending to corporations, hedge funds would not flee so readily from prime brokers, and investment banks would be less likely to turn to the government for financing.Eventually, the new company would make a public stock offering to value the bankruptcy estate's ownership interest, and the estate would distribute its assets according to statutory priority rules. If the valuation came in at $52 billion, Lehman shareholders would be wiped out, as they were in 2008. Long-term debtholders, with $96 billion in claims, would recover 54 cents on the dollar, more than the 37 cents they did receive. All other creditors--the large majority--would be paid in full at maturity.Other reforms, such as higher capital requirements, may yet be needed to reduce risk and lessen the chance of financial failure. But that is no reason to wait on bankruptcy reform. A bill along the lines of the chapter 14 that we advocate passed the House Judiciary Committee on Feb. 11. Two versions await action in the Senate. Let's end too big to fail, once and for all.Ms. Kapur is an attorney and economics Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University.

Clinton and Sanders Are Wrong on Fracking; The fracking-based natural gas revolution has resulted in the U.S. becoming the only nation in the world to reduce its CO footprint over the past 10 years.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773301424?accountid=12768,"In addition to the economic and scientific hypocrisy of opposing fracking as outlined in your editorial ""Clinton Against American Energy "" (March 8), I find it ironic that the environmental opposition to fracking ignores the fact that the fracking-based natural gas revolution has resulted in the U.S. becoming the only nation in the world to reduce its CO footprint over the past 10 years. Instead of opposing fracking, we should be encouraging even more fracking and natural-gas consumption as we map a cost-competitive path to lower carbon emissions over the next few decades.Frank MurphySt. LouisOf course Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are against fracking. When properly regulated by states, fracking has shown it is perfectly safe and doesn't pollute. But there remains the theoretical possibility that fracking will be unregulated and may pollute. So we should ban fracking with the good intention of avoiding any possibility of polluting? The consequences may be much higher energy prices which like a regressive tax would impact the poor the most. But this doesn't matter. These are progressive policies and to progressives it is only good intentions that matter. The consequences are irrelevant.Stephen R.S. MartinCave Creek, Ariz.The reason fracking is supported by Democrats like Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper--who holds a master's degree in geology--is because hydraulic fracturing, with proper regulation, can be done safely. The Environmental Protection Agency has found that fracking doesn't contaminate groundwater resources.Secretary Clinton's assertion that her stipulations would greatly restrict fracking is blatantly untrue, unless she plans to implement much stricter standards.Isaac OrrThe Heartland InstituteSt. Paul, Minn.",3/15/16

Bernie Sanders continued to attack rival Hillary Clinton ahead of a critical day of balloting , while Mrs. Clinton suggested voters on Tuesday could deliver a knockout blow that would allow her to pivot toward the general election.The two Democratic presidential candidates spent Monday campaigning in four of the five states that host primaries on Tuesday. The marquee contests were in Ohio and Florida, with both campaigns predicting a tight race in the former and an easy Clinton win in the latter.Also casting ballots Tuesday are voters in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina.Monday, the candidates adopted very different tones. Mrs. Clinton, who holds a commanding lead in delegates, barely alluded to Mr. Sanders as she urged supporters in Chicago to turn out to vote.""Do not rest,"" she said. With success on Tuesday, she said, the campaign would ""be able to start talking about not only unifying the Democratic Party, but also unifying our country.""In Ohio, Mr. Sanders was on the offense. He mocked Mrs. Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street firms, saying they must be ""Shakespearean"" to garner $225,000 apiece; suggested she told bankers one thing and tells voters another about regulating Wall Street; and said her support for trade agreements makes her complicit in the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs.""I proudly stood with the workers. Secretary Clinton stood with the big-moneyed interests,"" the Vermont senator said in Youngstown, the first of five rallies in four states planned for the day.In Tuesday's top two races, the political dynamics were very different.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 News.* Live Coverage: Tuesday's Primaries* Theranos Founder to Host Clinton Fundraiser* Democrats Play It Safe With Primary Predictions* In Illinois, Clinton and Sanders Vie for Obama LegacyIn Ohio, Mr. Sanders was hoping to repeat last week's victory in neighboring Michigan, another state filled with working-class, white voters dependent on manufacturing and skeptical of free trade. On the trail, he repeatedly pointed to Mrs. Clinton's support for ""disastrous"" trade agreements that he said have ""cost this country millions of decent-paying jobs.""The campaign was also working to turn out young people and was buoyed by an Ohio court ruling last week that allows 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the general election to cast primary ballots.At his Cleveland office, Mr. Sanders's Ohio director, Jeff Rusnak, kept track of 50 colleges in the state, their student populations and spring-break dates. The chart shows a challenge: Some 168,000 students, including those at flagship Ohio State University, are on break this week.Mr. Rusnak, a local political consultant, wasn't even hired until about a month ago, but now the campaign has offices in all the state's major cities, and he was working to activate a strong volunteer base that grew online before professionals arrived in the state. The key issue, he said, is trade. ""No state, other than Michigan, has been more affected,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton responded by intensifying her criticism of a sweeping trade agreement with Pacific Rim nations and calling for tougher rules for auto imports. But she also said that trade ""done right"" could help thousands of companies in the state.""We need a president who is not just opposed to trade,"" Mrs. Clinton said at a Democratic Party dinner Sunday. ""We need a president who knows how to compete against the rest of the world and win.""Over the weekend, she crisscrossed the state, offering pep talks to campaign volunteers, dropping references to local issues and companies, visiting African-American churches, touring manufacturing facilities and, on Saturday night, stopping by an Irish pub in downtown Youngstown for a beer and a barstool campaign pitch.""It's the best Guinness I've ever had. A Youngstown Guinness!"" she said.East of Cleveland, in suburban Lake County, Mrs. Clinton was getting help from an informal club of about 10 women who became friends during the 2004 election and regroup every two years to volunteer on Democratic campaigns. Two of them, wearing ""Women for Hillary"" buttons over lunch in Mentor last week, said they haven't been contacted by the campaign and have been left to draw a game plan on their own. They said there seems to be more activity among local Sanders backers.""I'm a nervous wreck. I really want her to be our nominee and I feel there is more work being done on the other side,"" said Leslie Bruckman, 60, of Waite Hill.Aaron Pickrell, the Clinton campaign's Ohio state director, said the campaign hasn't been able to reach every supporter. ""We have a lot of strong supporters out there. When you're ramping up as quickly as we have, you get out of the way and let supporters do their thing,"" he said.In Florida, Tuesday's biggest primary prize, the Clinton supporters were more confident. It has many of the older voters that tend to favor her, and early voting began before Mr. Sanders got a boost from his Michigan win. Plus, Florida doesn't allow independents to vote in party primaries, which hurts Mr. Sanders who has appealed to them in prior primaries.Mrs. Clinton also enjoys strong support from Latino voters, some of whom draw a line from Mr. Sanders's brand of socialism and promise of a revolution to repressive Latin American regimes.""He'd like to have a socialist revolution, which in South Florida we know something about because we've been through some in Nicaragua, Venezuela and Cuba,"" said Philip Levine, mayor of Miami Beach, who is backing Mrs. Clinton.The Sanders campaign is hoping to avoid a blowout, which would allow Mrs. Clinton to pad her delegate lead and make up for any losses elsewhere. At a Sanders rally last week in Tampa, some 9,000 people chanted his name and constantly interrupted his speech with cheers.""It's amazing to be involved and watching this history happen,"" said Amanda Schribner, 18, of Valrico, Fla. She said she was planning to make phone calls for Mr. Sanders ahead of the election, but like others at the event, she hadn't had contact with the campaign and didn't know where to go. Still, her vote was assured. ""I voted on the first day of early voting,"" she said.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler And Colleen McCain Nelson",3/15/16
"The Military-Free 2016 Contenders; Trump, Cruz, Clinton, Sanders and the rest all share one trait: None has served in the armed forces.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773032395?accountid=12768,"For months the presidential candidates of both political parties have been telling the world about their experience, their wisdom, their love of country. But there is one thing the remaining contenders don't bring up. It is the blank line on all of their résumés:Of the candidates still in the race, not one has served a single day in the military. Not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, not Donald Trump, not Ted Cruz, not Marco Rubio, not John Kasich. (And not Ben Carson, who dropped out earlier this month.)There is no requirement for a president to have spent time in the armed forces. In this era of the all-volunteer military, it is perhaps unremarkable that the remaining candidates are lifelong civilians.It once was rare for a November election to occur without at least one of the major-party candidates having a military background. It was a plus: something voters could identify with and admire. When, in 2012, Barack Obama ran against Mitt Romney, it was the first time in 68 years--since Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for re-election against Thomas E. Dewey in 1944--that neither candidate had served in the armed forces.One of the many sacrifices that military men and women make is to delay--and in some cases relinquish--the arrival of the day when they will be able to climb the civilian career ladder. Those who opt not to serve are, in that respect, given a leg up: a head start.With that in mind, during this 2016 campaign I have made it a point, every night, to do some reading--to escape for a few minutes from the candidates' focus-grouped attack lines, and the bellicose social-media posts of paid strategists, and the rehearsed cable-interview zingers. I have instead been reading the citations that, through U.S. history, have accompanied the presentation of the Medal of Honor. They are easy to find, if you look: either online or in books. Maybe not as easy to find as campaign blather, but still readily available.""Although painfully wounded as he charged the first machinegun, he launched a vigorous singlehanded grenade attack, destroyed the entire hostile gun position and moved relentlessly forward toward the other emplacement despite his wounds. . . . His indomitable fighting spirit and decisive valor in the face of almost certain death reflect the highest credit upon Cpl. Hauge. . . . He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.""Those words are about Louis James Hauge Jr., a Marine corporal from Ada, Minn., who, at age 20, lost his life at Okinawa on May 14, 1945.Presidential campaigns, by their nature, are self-centered enterprises. If they were boiled down to a single phrase, it would be: ""Choose me."" So it feels like an antidote to instead read each night about some Americans for whom ""Choose me"" was an alien thought: Americans who, in the defining moments of their lives, chose to think only of others.Thus, family members of Fred W. Stockham, a World War I Marine gunnery sergeant from Detroit who died in Bois-de-Belleau, France, in 1918, were told, via his Medal of Honor citation, that ""G/Sgt. Stockham, upon noticing that the gas mask of a wounded comrade was shot away, without hesitation removed his own gas mask and insisted on giving it to the wounded man, well knowing that the effects of the gas would be fatal to himself. He continued with undaunted courage and valor to direct and assist in the evacuation of the wounded, until he himself collapsed from the effects of the gas, dying as a result thereof a few days later.""The names on those citations, most of us have never heard. The bearers of those names didn't seem to feel a hunger for applause. James W. Robinson Jr., of Hinsdale, Ill., was an Army infantry sergeant who, while trying to rescue a wounded comrade in Vietnam in April 1966, ""was himself wounded in the shoulder and leg. . . . His rifle ammunition expended, he seized 2 grenades and, in an act of unsurpassed heroism, charged toward the entrenched enemy weapon. Hit again in the leg, this time with a tracer round which set fire to his clothing, Sgt. Robinson ripped the burning clothing from his body and staggered indomitably through the enemy fire . . . as he fell dead upon the battlefield. His magnificent display of leadership and bravery saved several lives and inspired his soldiers to defeat the numerically superior enemy force.""Will the day again arrive when military service is regarded as an attribute for a would-be presidential candidate? Or is the election of 2016 merely a sign of things to come: of an American political future in which those who serve are seen as separate from those who run?Mr. Greene's books include ""Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War"" (William Morrow, 2001).Credit: By Bob Greene",3/15/16
"Democrats Play It Safe With Primary Predictions; Since Michigan, the campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been trying to ensure they don't fall short of their own primary forecasts",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773032241?accountid=12768,"CHICAGO--To hear the two Democratic presidential campaigns tell it, neither Hillary Clinton nor Sen. Bernie Sanders will win Tuesday's primaries .Although polls show the former secretary of state with a comfortable lead in at least some of the states that hold the next contests, the race is closer than those surveys suggest, Clinton campaign officials say. The demographics of the Midwestern states that vote on Tuesday are tailor-made for Mr. Sanders, they add.For his part, the Vermont senator has declined to predict which of the five states holding primaries he will win.Since Mr. Sanders scored an upset victory in last week's Michigan primary , both campaigns have been more willing to forecast losses than wins, trying to ensure they don't fall short of their own pre-election predictions.The political parlor game of managing expectations has ratcheted up several notches in recent days, lest anyone repeat the mistakes of Michigan, where polls showed Mrs. Clinton with a comfortable lead. It's a delicate balance, though, as both candidates continue to project confidence that they can win the Democratic nomination while shying from raising the stakes in any one state with definitive declarations.David Axelrod, a former White House and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama, said the Michigan surprise served as a reminder that campaigns should lay out achievable objectives, at least publicly.""They kind of let expectations get away from them,"" he said of Clinton's loss in Michigan. ""You want to set the mark you know you can beat.""Lesson learned, it seems, as Clinton campaign aides have played down her prospects in an assortment of states during the past several days. Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton's communications director, said the demographics of Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, which hold primaries on Tuesday, are similar to Michigan's profile, which could provide a boost to Mr. Sanders.""The history of this primary has shown that he comes in at an advantage"" in those Midwestern states, Ms. Palmieri said. ""That's not an excuse. That's what our experience has been.""In 2008, when Mrs. Clinton faced Mr. Obama in the race for the Democratic nomination, she argued that the candidate who won the Ohio primary would be best positioned to win the White House. The state has been one of the main battlegrounds in presidential elections in recent decades. Mrs. Clinton triumphed in the Buckeye State in 2008, but her campaign is making no such claim this time around.""She was wrong. She was mistaken,"" Ms. Palmieri said of Mrs. Clinton's previous assertion that Ohio was a must-win primary.Mr. Sanders has continued to make the case that he can narrow Mrs. Clinton's lead in convention delegates. But on Sunday, he stopped short of predicting victory in any of Tuesday's primaries, which include Florida and North Carolina, as well.Pressed to name a state he could win decisively in the next round of voting, Mr. Sanders told CNN, ""I think we're going to have a good day on Tuesday.""He added that he expected success in several states that hold contests in the weeks ahead.Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, has been blunt in assessing the primary map, saying recently that Florida could be out of reach.If Florida allowed independents to vote in the primary rather than restricting it to Democratic Party members, ""we'd light the whole place up and be very aggressive in trying to win here,"" Mr. Devine said. ""But we'll be realistic. While we have a lot of resources, we want to spend them wisely.""Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist, said the campaigns' reasons for keeping expectations in check are simple. ""You want to mobilize and motivate every supporter you can,"" he said. And ""after Michigan, no one wants to be wrong.""Mrs. Clinton collected more delegates overall than Mr. Sanders in last week's primaries by winning Mississippi by a large margin while narrowly losing Michigan. But the unexpected defeat dominated news coverage for days and bolstered Mr. Sanders's campaign.Because expectations are higher for Mrs. Clinton than for Mr. Sanders, long the underdog in the race, the Clinton campaign has been more assertive in trying to lower them. It has walked a fine line as the candidate and her aides predict long-term success while warning of possible setbacks in the short-term.Campaigning in Chicago on Monday, Mrs. Clinton told voters that with their support, she could begin the work of unifying the Democratic Party.When asked two days earlier whether she would win Ohio, Mrs. Clinton demurred. ""We're going to work hard,"" she said. ""We're going to work really, really hard.""Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",3/15/16

""No state, other than Michigan, has been more affected,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton responded by intensifying her criticism of a sweeping trade agreement with Pacific Rim nations and calling for tougher rules for auto imports. But she also said that trade ""done right"" could help thousands of companies in the state.""We need a president who is not just opposed to trade,"" Mrs. Clinton said at a Democratic Party dinner Sunday. ""We need a president who knows how to compete against the rest of the world and win.""Over the weekend, she crisscrossed the state, offering pep talks to campaign volunteers, dropping references to local issues and companies, visiting African-American churches, touring manufacturing facilities and, on Saturday night, stopping by an Irish pub in downtown Youngstown for a beer and a barstool campaign pitch.""It's the best Guinness I've ever had. A Youngstown Guinness!"" she said.East of Cleveland, in suburban Lake County, Mrs. Clinton was getting help from an informal club of about 10 women who became friends during the 2004 election and regroup every two years to volunteer on Democratic campaigns. Two of them, wearing ""Women for Hillary"" buttons over lunch in Mentor last week, said they haven't been contacted by the campaign and have been left to draw a game plan on their own. They said there seems to be more activity among local Sanders backers.""I'm a nervous wreck. I really want her to be our nominee and I feel there is more work being done on the other side,"" said Leslie Bruckman, 60, of Waite Hill.Aaron Pickrell, the Clinton campaign's Ohio state director, said the campaign hasn't been able to reach every supporter. ""We have a lot of strong supporters out there. When you're ramping up as quickly as we have, you get out of the way and let supporters do their thing,"" he said.In Florida, Tuesday's biggest primary prize, the Clinton supporters were more confident. It has many of the older voters that tend to favor her, and early voting began before Mr. Sanders got a boost from his Michigan win. Plus, Florida doesn't allow independents to vote in party primaries, which hurts Mr. Sanders who has appealed to them in prior primaries.Mrs. Clinton also enjoys strong support from Latino voters, some of whom draw a line from Mr. Sanders's brand of socialism and promise of a revolution to repressive Latin American regimes.""He'd like to have a socialist revolution, which in South Florida we know something about because we've been through some in Nicaragua, Venezuela and Cuba,"" said Philip Levine, mayor of Miami Beach, who is backing Mrs. Clinton.The Sanders campaign is hoping to avoid a blowout, which would allow Mrs. Clinton to pad her delegate lead and make up for any losses elsewhere. At a Sanders rally last week in Tampa, some 9,000 people chanted his name and constantly interrupted his speech with cheers.""It's amazing to be involved and watching this history happen,"" said Amanda Schribner, 18, of Valrico, Fla. She said she was planning to make phone calls for Mr. Sanders ahead of the election, but like others at the event, she hadn't had contact with the campaign and didn't know where to go. Still, her vote was assured. ""I voted on the first day of early voting,"" she said.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler And Colleen McCain Nelson",3/15/16
"In Illinois, Clinton and Sanders Vie for Obama Legacy; Democratic candidates promote themselves as best able to take up president's mantle",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773025533?accountid=12768,"Voters in President Barack Obama's home state of Illinois will help decide Tuesday which of the two Democratic candidates should be the heir to his political legacy.With polls showing the race tightening, both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have pitched themselves as best positioned to defend and expand on the president's achievements. Mrs. Clinton points to her service in the Obama administration, her commitment to preserving the president's signature health-care law and her desire to improve race relations.Though he has repeatedly called for a ""political revolution"" against the current establishment, Mr. Sanders has praised Mr. Obama's handling of the financial crisis. His youth-driven campaign and enthusiastic small-donor base have drawn comparisons with Mr. Obama's presidential campaigns.Republican voters vote on Tuesday too, though most of the campaign attention is focused on Ohio and Florida, do-or-die home-state races for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who trail badly in the delegate count to front-runner Donald Trump.In many ways, Illinois is a microcosm for the broader U.S. electorate. The state has a racial makeup very similar to the country at large, with substantial populations of Hispanic and black voters. It has one of the country's largest urban centers in Chicago, as well as substantial blocs of rural and suburban voters.As a result, experts say the state is something of a bellwether for the rest of the country--offering a preview of how different demographic groups might lean in November. ""The racial composition of the population and the electorate are almost spot-on for what they are for the U.S. as a whole,"" said William Frey, a demographics expert with the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program.Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton both made visits to the state on the eve of the primary, holding rallies in Chicago. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz barnstormed across the state hoping to blunt Mr. Trump's momentum with a day full of campaign stops. Illinois was an epicenter of protests against Mr. Trump that turned violent last week when he was forced to cancel a Chicago speech.Polls on the Democratic side point to a tightening race. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll of the state showed Mrs. Clinton leading 51% to 45%. An online CBS News poll showed Mr. Sanders winning 48% to 46%.Clinton campaign officials said the demographics in the Midwestern states that vote Tuesday play to Mr. Sanders's strengths. His surprise victory in last week's Michigan primary suggests Mrs. Clinton could be at a disadvantage in states such as Illinois, campaign officials said. They believe she can still win more delegates overall Tuesday even if Mr. Sanders notches one or more wins in Midwestern states.On the GOP side, polls show that Mr. Trump has a lead in the state. The Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday showed him ahead of Mr. Cruz, his nearest competitor, by 9 points. But on the Republican side, Illinois awards most of its delegates by congressional district--meaning all of the Republican campaigns could potentially earn delegates from the contests.""The lion's share of the Republican vote in the state is in the suburbs of Chicago,"" said Brad McMillan, the executive director of the Institute for Principled Leadership in Public Service at Bradley University and a former Republican congressional staffer.Credit: By Byron Tau",3/15/16
Sanders Puts Emphasis on Delegate Math; Vermont senator's campaign shifts strategy to maximize Democratic delegates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772631821?accountid=12768,"On the eve of a five-state showdown Tuesday Bernie Sanders's campaign has dropped its focus on winning marquee states in favor of scooping up delegates anywhere it can find them, hoping to show he still has a chance of overcoming Hillary Clinton's large lead and capturing the Democratic presidential nomination.Mr. Sanders's shift in strategy is a response to the hard realities of delegate math: Despite an upset victory in Michigan last week that cheered his supporters he is losing ground to Mrs. Clinton and in danger of reaching the point where it is impossible to catch up.Two states where the Sanders campaign concedes he will have a tough time winning Tuesday are Florida and North Carolina. Rather than cede them to Mrs. Clinton and focus on winning a trio of Midwestern states where his prospects are brighter, Mr. Sanders late last week expanded his television advertising in certain Florida and North Carolina markets, his advisers said. The idea is to pluck a few extra delegates in the face of an expected Clinton victory in both states.""The goal Tuesday is to win as many delegates as we can. And if we can win states, too, that's a big plus,"" said Tad Devine, a Sanders campaign strategist. ""Now we have to build a foundation of delegates. A lot of delegates are in play [on Tuesday]. We can get a lot of them, we think. The advertising in some of these [Florida and North Carolina] markets may make the difference.""That is different than the approach Mr. Sanders has taken in the past. When 11 states were up for grabs on March 1, Mr. Sanders did scant advertising and spent little time in Southern states where his rival was favored. He focused instead on capturing a handful of states--including Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma--and demonstrating he could beat Mrs. Clinton outside his home base of New England.But the limitations of targeting a few high-profile states have become clear. Delegates are awarded proportionally based on results and because of Mrs. Clinton's lopsided victories in Southern states she has taken a commanding lead.Take the case of Michigan. For all the attention paid to Mr. Sanders's upset victory there, the tight margins in the race--he won by 1.5 percentage points--meant he netted just seven more pledged delegates than Mrs. Clinton. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton won 26 more delegates than Mr. Sanders in Mississippi, which she won in a landslide. So, when the voting was all done that night, Mr. Sanders won the headline while Mrs. Clinton expanded her lead by 19 delegates.She now has 766 pledged delegates compared with 551 for Mr. Sanders, according to the Associated Press. Add in the ""superdelegates""--Democratic officials free to support whomever they choose--and her lead is 1,231 to 576. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.For Mrs. Clinton, the dynamics are the opposite of what she faced in her 2008 race against then-Sen. Barack Obama. Mr. Obama jumped to a formidable delegate lead in the early going. She was never able to close the gap despite impressive wins in Pennsylvania and other states later in the calendar. Now, Mrs. Clinton is benefiting from the same delegate formulas that were her undoing eight years ago.Tom Nides, a deputy to Mrs. Clinton when she served as secretary of state and now a fundraiser for her campaign, said: ""We're basically following the Obama math in 2008. Obama did well enough in some states and really well in other states and he made the math completely impossible for Hillary to get the nomination.""An analysis by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shows that Mr. Sanders would need to win 61% of the remaining pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates to catch up to Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders said he isn't deterred, noting superdelegates are free to change their minds. They might do just that if they see him winning and come to believe he's the best bet to defeat the Republican nominee--possibly Donald Trump--in the fall, he said.In an appearance Sunday on CNN, Mr. Sanders said ""if we do well in a number of states and if the general sentiment becomes that Bernie Sanders is the candidate who will defeat Donald Trump"" superdelegates might ""swing over"" to his campaign.Polling shows Mrs. Clinton with substantial leads in the three other states that vote on Tuesday: Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll.Privately, both campaigns said they believe the race to be tighter. Mr. Sanders's victory in Michigan underscored the strength of his anti-free trade message, a message likely to resonate in neighboring Ohio and Illinois. He also has sought to energize his supporters and perhaps cut into Mrs. Clinton's lead among African-Americans by taking aim at Chicago's Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel.Mr. Sanders noted that the Chicago mayor has endorsed Mrs. Clinton and said: ""I do not want Mayor Emanuel's endorsement if I win the nomination.""Mrs. Clinton jabbed at Mr. Sanders's record and policy positions, highlighting the Vermont senator's opposition to the auto bailout at a rally in Youngstown and questioning his push for single-payer health care at a church near Cleveland on Sunday. ""I sure don't want to start over like my opponent does,"" Mrs. Clinton said, underscoring her support for the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Sanders has said he voted for a bill in 2008 designed to rescue the auto industry. Mrs. Clinton's reference is to another bill that included funds for bailing out Wall Street banks and also contained money to help the auto industry. Mr. Sanders opposed that bill.Clinton aides don't expect Mr. Sanders to withdraw from the race anytime soon. But some in her circle are eager to move on. Whatever happens on Tuesday, they said they would like Mr. Sanders to forego his attacks on the party front-runner.Alan Patricof, a Clinton fundraiser, said: ""I'm tired of his message."" He added: ""He throws a lot of slings and arrows.""Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",3/15/16
"Bernie Sanders Scores Upset in Michigan Democratic Primary; Hillary Clinton captured Mississippi, completing a clean sweep of the Deep South with a heavy turnout of African-American voters",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771317241?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders proved his grit in the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday, defeating Hillary Clinton in Michigan and showing strength for the first time in a large, racially diverse state far from his home base of New England.Mrs. Clinton easily captured Mississippi, completing a clean sweep of the Deep South powered by her overwhelming popularity among African-American voters in the region. But Mr. Sanders, in winning his most populous state this primary season, made inroads with black voters in Michigan, according to exit polls, winning 30% of the state's African-American primary vote.With 92% of precincts counted in Michigan, Mr. Sanders had 50% of the vote to 48% for Mrs. Clinton. The state will award, proportionally, 130 pledged delegates to the summer Democratic convention.The win gives Mr. Sanders a jolt of momentum at an important moment in the race. He and Mrs. Clinton face off Wednesday in a debate in Florida. Nearly 700 convention delegates are at stake in the next round of voting, next Tuesday, and the Sanders camp hopes the Michigan result will reverberate in two other large Midwestern states that vote then: Ohio and Illinois.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Capital Journal: Angry White Males Propel Donald Trump--and Bernie Sanders* Tenor of Campaign Takes a Toll: WSJ/NBC Poll* Democrats Draw a Diverse Voting Pool in Exit Polls* Clinton's Lead Over Sanders Narrows Slightly in WSJ/NBC Poll* Michigan Turnout Shows Split on ClintonThe other three states to vote next Tuesday are Florida, Missouri and North Carolina.Both candidates had fought hard in Michigan. Trailing in delegates and written off by some Democrats, Mr. Sanders visited the state repeatedly and aired TV ads for the past three weeks in hopes of proving he could go toe-to-toe with Mrs. Clinton in a large industrial state.""Not only is Michigan the gateway to the rest of the industrial Midwest, the results there show that we are a national campaign,"" Mr. Sanders said in a statement. ""We already have won in the Midwest, New England and the Great Plains, and as more people get to know more about who we are and what our views are, we're going to do very well.""Mrs. Clinton's blowout win in Mississippi--she led Mr. Sanders by some 67 percentage points with 94% of precincts reported--means she could end the night with a wider delegate lead over her rival.Still, the Michigan loss is a serious setback given the time she spent campaigning in the state. Mrs. Clinton put the water crisis in the city of Flint front-and-center, using her national platform to get more money and assistance for a city plagued by polluted drinking water. On the trail, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, repeatedly invoked her response to the Flint crisis as evidence she has the temperament and judgment to be president. The appeal fell short, with Mr. Sanders winning the bulk of counties across the state, although Mrs. Clinton won the counties in the populous Detroit region.""There are similarities between Michigan and parts of Ohio and Illinois that have experienced high levels of deindustrialization due to policies that Secretary Clinton has supported over and over again,"" said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager.That line of attack has been taken by Mr. Sanders himself, highlighting Mrs. Clinton's early support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Pacific Rim nations and for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by her husband in the 1990s.Mr. Sanders had notched wins in eight of the first 20 Democratic contests coming into Tuesday, but his victories generally had come in small states with overwhelmingly white electorates or that use a caucus format that attracts grass-roots activists, who have migrated to his campaign.The result is a commanding lead for Mrs. Clinton in the tally of pledged delegates. Coming into Tuesday, not counting the so-called superdelegates that aren't awarded by voters, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders 694 delegates to 477. Mississippi awarded 36 delegates.After Mrs. Clinton addressed supporters in Cleveland Tuesday night, and before the Michigan winner was announced, her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters she would increase her delegate lead. ""Our strategy is built around accruing delegates,"" she said.A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed the Democratic race tightening nationally, with Mrs. Clinton's lead over Mr. Sanders narrowing to nine points among Democratic primary voters. In February, the former secretary of state led by 11 points, and in January, she led by 24 points in the poll.The senator has expended limited resources in several states that Mrs. Clinton won by wide margins. But his campaign long counted on Michigan to serve as a launchpad to next week's primaries.Tuesday in Ferndale, Mich., voters split between the two Democrats. Elizabeth and Gerald Collins both backed Mrs. Clinton. ""I think she has the best chance to win,"" Mrs. Collins, 51, said. ""I like where she stands on many of the issues.""Mr. Collins, 58, added that he believes people aren't ready for Mr. Sanders and his ideas.Josh Hartwig, 29, disagreed, casting his vote for Mr. Sanders because, he said, he supports the ""common man.""Clinton campaign officials have long argued the Democratic nomination would be decided in March. And after scoring eight victories on Super Tuesday and winning Louisiana this past weekend, Mrs. Clinton entered Tuesday well positioned to build on her delegate lead. The goal, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has said, is to compete everywhere and methodically amass delegates, making it mathematically impossible for Mr. Sanders to catch up.The Sanders campaign believes the race is winnable, saying the map only gets more favorable. The calendar was ""front-loaded"" with Southern states loyal to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, formerly the Arkansas governor, Mr. Weaver said.""Secretary Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas for many years,"" he said. ""Her base is in the South and she's done very, very well in the South.""Before Michigan began counting votes, the Democratic contenders already had turned their attention to the next big prizes in their presidential race, with Mrs. Clinton skipping over to Ohio and Mr. Sanders headed to Florida.With next week's Florida primary in their sights, the Democratic presidential campaigns held dueling conference calls over which candidate would be best for the Latino community.The Sanders campaign has been on the defense because of the Vermont senator's 2007 opposition to a comprehensive immigration bill that would have provided undocumented immigrants with a path to citizenship.""It is clear Hillary is the only one we can trust to lead 12 million people out of the shadows,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., Ill.) told reporters on a call organized by the Clinton campaign.Mr. Sanders's campaign sought to broaden the subject beyond immigration to who best understands and would improve the lives of Latino voters.Mr. Weaver, the Sanders campaign manager, said the senator is the ""son of an immigrant himself, who came to this country not speaking English, who saw firsthand and lived firsthand the experience of immigrant communities.""Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",3/15/16
Sanders Coalition Shows Strength in Michigan; Vermont senator's voter base could make for other close races in the Midwest,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771315565?accountid=12768,"The Bernie Sanders coalition--a mix of young voters, liberals and independents--is still a potent force in the Democratic primary race.With his unexpected win in Michigan's primary on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders proved his voting base still has power, just as the nominating calendar is about to turn to similar Midwestern states, including Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin.Mr. Sanders's voting base had little visibility in Mississippi on Tuesday, where Hillary Clinton won an overwhelming victory on the strength of African-American voters, who made up more than 60% of the voter pool.But in Michigan, where black voters accounted only for about one-quarter of the electorate and gave Mrs. Clinton less of a boost, the Sanders coalition held far more sway.Mr. Sanders carried a commanding 8 in 10 voters under age 30, according to preliminary results of surveys of voters after they cast ballots. He won more than two-thirds of voters under age 45. And while Mrs. Clinton won a lopsided share of African-American voters, Mr. Sanders won nearly 6 in 10 white voters, according to exit polls reported by CNN and other media.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Hillary Clinton's Lead Over Bernie Sanders Narrows Slightly in WSJ/NBC Poll* Michigan Turnout Shows Split on Clinton* What to Watch in Tuesday's Nominating ContestsA similar coalition could make for equally close races in other Midwest states with roots in manufacturing, where the voter pools look more like those of Michigan than of other states that have voted so far.Its white, non-Hispanic population, at 76% of all residents, looks similar to the 80% share of white residents in Ohio, 78% Pennsylvania and 82% Wisconsin. The percentage of people who are 25 or older with a bachelor's degree, at 26%, is in line with those three states. The median household income in Michigan, at $49,000, is also close to those in the three nearby states, which all sit between $49,000 and $53,000. And, of course, each of the states has deep roots and history in blue-collar manufacturing.Mr. Sanders has already won one upper Midwest state, Minnesota, where Democrats held caucuses rather than a primary.The Tuesday night results have a message for both Democratic candidates. For Mrs. Clinton it is that her campaign needs a rationale and message as compelling as Mr. Sanders's call for a ""political revolution'' against the wealthy and Wall Street, which has caught the imagination of the party's liberals and young voters.For Mr. Sanders, it is that winning the nomination in a racially diverse party is difficult without winning support from nonwhite voters.Mr. Sanders's weak support among African-Americans has severely hampered him in the South, but he may find diverse states outside the South to be friendlier ground. He won 30% of African-American voters in Michigan, his best showing in any state for which there are exit polls and a far larger share than the single-digit support he had drawn in several Southern primaries.As in other Southern states, Mrs. Clinton's victory in Mississippi rested on support from nearly 9 in 10 African American voters, exit polls showed.In a noteworthy development, men accounted for less than 40% of Democratic primary voters in Mississippi, the exit polls found, with women making up 61% of the electorate. That was a slightly higher share than the average of 58% that women have accounted for in prior nominating contests this year. Mrs. Clinton won convincingly among both men and women.Donald Trump carried Mississippi's Republican primary. Like Mrs. Clinton, he has won the contests in Southern states, including those in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.As in prior contests, Mr. Trump's support was strongest among voters without a college degree and those on the lower end of the income scale. But he swept almost every other group, as well, even expanding the coalition that had delivered other Southern states to him.In winning the South Carolina primary, Mr. Trump had lost to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio among college graduates while carrying those without a college degree by large margins. In Mississippi on Tuesday, Mr. Trump won among voters at all levels of education.In winning Georgia, Mr. Trump had lost to Mr. Rubio among voters with household incomes above $100,000. In Mississippi, he won among voters at all income levels.Mr. Trump won among Republican Party members and independents who cast ballots. He carried evangelical Christians and non-evangelicals, foiling Sen. Ted Cruz, who had hoped to build a leading position among evangelicals.Mr. Cruz, a favorite of social conservatives, carried voters who rated themselves ""very conservative,'' as he had in prior contests, and by a large margin he won among voters who say it's important that they share the nominee's values. But those voters did not make up large shares of the electorate.Write to Dante Chinni at Dante.Chinni@wsj.comCredit: By Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni",3/15/16
Tea in Harlem: Sanders Meets With Sharpton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764280667?accountid=12768,"The morning after Bernie Sanders's sweeping victory in the New Hampshire presidential primary, the Vermont senator took his momentum to a Harlem landmark to have tea with the Rev. Al Sharpton.Mr. Sanders arrived at the famed Sylvia's restaurant around 9:50 a.m. Wednesday and waved to a crowd chanting his name. Mr. Sharpton said the meeting lasted 20 minutes and that the senator's visit sent the right message to the black community.Mr. Sharpton said he asked Mr. Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, about the water crisis in Flint, Mich., affirmative action and police misconduct.""My concern is that in January of next year, for the first time in American history, a black family will be moving out of the White House,"" Mr. Sharpton said. ""I do not want black concerns to be moved out with them.""He said he hadn't decided on an endorsement in the 2016 race, and he will meet with Hillary Clinton next Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton's camp confirmed the meeting.""Sen. Sanders coming here this morning further makes it clear that we will not be ignored,"" Mr. Sharpton said. ""Our votes must be earned.""He added Mr. Sanders was also meeting with Kirsten John Foy, Northeast regional director of National Action Network, a civil-rights organization founded by Mr. Sharpton.Also on hand was former head of the NAACP, Ben Jealous, and State Sen. Bill Perkins, a Manhattan Democrat. Both have endorsed Mr. Sanders.""Harlem represents the black community and other communities of color in general but he's going to make sure that he's in all those communities so everybody gets to have the Bern,"" Mr. Perkins said.Also Wednesday, Mr. Sanders appeared on the ABC television show ""The View,"" and a CBS spokeswoman said he would appear Wednesday night on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""Tren'ness Woods-Black, the director of communications for Sylvia's (and granddaughter of Sylvia), said the restaurant remained open to the public during the senator's visit.""We wanted to allow everyone to be able to interact and get a just up-close and personal look at who's actually running,"" said Ms. Woods-Black.Some, however, were disappointed Mr. Sanders didn't do more to interact with the public. After a quick wave to the crowd, the senator departed in his car after the breakfast. Yo Akalu, a 27-year-old City University of New York student, didn't believe the visit was genuine.""If he really wants our votes he really needs to come into these projects, he really needs to go into these schools, he really needs to speak to these families,"" Ms. Akalu said. ""Him coming out here to Harlem, coming straight to Sylvia's . . . what is that?""But Charles Mannings, a resident of Harlem for 20 years, said he thought the short visit was ""inspiring."" The 70-year-old retired chef said politicians tended to ignore Harlem.""I'm glad to see in this particular instance that is not the case,"" Mr. Mannings said. ""Maybe it's indicative of better things to come.""Credit: By Zolan Kanno-Youngs",3/15/16
"Democrats' Battle Shifts --- As race moves to friendlier ground for Clinton, Sanders works to broaden his appeal",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764279368?accountid=12768,"Democrats headed south and west after Sen. Bernie Sanders's resounding New Hampshire victory over Hillary Clinton, facing the twin questions of whether his appeal is broad enough to replicate his performance elsewhere -- and whether her support is strong enough to reverse the tide.Lying at the crossroads of those two questions are the minority voters who have transformed the Democratic Party in the past few decades and hold the promise of sustained success in the future.Mr. Sanders's first act after his 22-point victory in predominantly white New Hampshire was to travel to Harlem in New York on Wednesday and have breakfast with high-profile civil-rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton.In an interview, Rev. Sharpton said that by coming to Harlem after ""such a big victory,"" Mr. Sanders ""wanted to send a signal"" to the party's minority voters. ""She has deeper ties [to the black community] and longstanding friends,"" Mr. Sharpton said of Mrs. Clinton, ""but that doesn't mean he can't win voters.""Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign arranged a conference call Wednesday with prominent African-American figures who support the former secretary of state. They cast Mr. Sanders as an arriviste who has ignored issues important to African-Americans.""It's good to have new friends -- I would prefer to have true friends,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), who plans to go to South Carolina to campaign for Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton now is calling on the Clinton network of African-American supporters, looking to shore up the ""firewall"" her campaign says it has built in coming contests in South Carolina and other Southern states with large minority populations. The campaign is also tapping into her Hispanic network to sway Nevada voters.On primary night, the Clinton campaign understood that a defeat was coming in the Granite State. But the breadth of the loss left some of her supporters rattled and former President Bill Clinton angry, according to two people familiar with his thinking.Mr. Sanders beat her among women voters and won every age category save for voters over 65. He bested Mrs. Clinton not only among independents who participated in the primary -- and by a lopsided margin -- but topped her among Democratic Party members, 52% to 48%, exit polls showed.That could prove important, as the next primaries and caucuses will have far larger shares of Democrats and smaller shares of independents, who are barred entirely from party primaries in some states. Some 58% of voters in the New Hampshire primary were Democrats. By contrast, Democrats accounted for 81% of Nevada caucus-goers and 73% of South Carolina primary voters during the last competitive contests, in 2008.But Mr. Sanders's strength within the party's membership remains an open question. Mrs. Clinton carried Democratic Party members by 17 points in her narrow victory in Iowa's caucuses last week. And the Democrats in contests to come won't look like those in New Hampshire.Where 93% of New Hampshire's Democratic primary voters were white, only 43% of South Carolina primary voters and 65% of Nevada caucus-goers in 2008 were white. The New Hampshire primary didn't test one of the most important features of the coming contests -- whether Mrs. Clinton is retaining the substantial advantages she has shown among African-American and Hispanic voters in opinion polls.Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are planning to fan out in South Carolina in advance of the state's primary on Feb. 27, talking up Mrs. Clinton's credentials in a state where African-Americans account for more than half of the Democratic electorate.""I'm going to preach and teach, tell people to get out and vote for Hillary,"" said Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), who was beaten by state troopers in Selma, Ala., in 1965 during a voting-rights protest.Rep. Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.), the chairman of the black caucus's political-action committee, said that the group's board last week overwhelmingly voted to endorse Mrs. Clinton. Their formal announcement is expected on Thursday.Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, noted that the contests on March 1 include Texas, Alabama and Georgia -- states with substantial ""communities of color.""But Mr. Sanders is ceding no ground as his campaign has gained momentum. He won the endorsement of former NAACP President Ben Jealous, and he is about to roll out an ad that shows him marching with Rev.

"Clinton, Sanders Locked in Tie",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761637773?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Battling for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were locked in razor-tight contest for Iowa's delegates and the momentum that comes with a win in the nation's first contest.Throughout the night, less than a percentage point separated the pair, with Mrs. Clinton in the lead. With 96% of precincts reporting, her advantage was just 49.9% of the delegates versus 49.6% for Mr. Sanders, according to tabulations from the Iowa Democratic Party.""Tonight while the results are still not known it looks like we are in a virtual tie,"" Mr Sanders told cheering supporters. He added, ""I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message."" His cheering supporters replied, ""Feel the Bern!""Mrs. Clinton, addressing her own supporters in Des Moines, said, ""It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now: to have a real contest of ideas, to really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for."" She added that she was ""breathing a big sigh of relief,"" though she didn't declare victory.The results amounted to a virtual tie, and mean that Iowa will send roughly an equal number of delegates for each candidate to the party's national convention this summer, where the nominee will be officially selected. They also offer a dose of good news for both campaigns. Mr. Sanders can say that he battled the prohibitive front-runner to a tie, while Mrs. Clinton avoids what would have been an embarrassing defeat.The upstart Vermont senator, whose entry to the Democratic presidential race barely registered, has both new money and new momentum. In January, Mr. Sanders raised $20 million, and with most of his donations well below the legal limit, he can go back to his donors for more.""The thing that generally ends campaigns is lack of resources,"" said David Axelrod, who helped steer President Barack Obama's two victories. ""This does not seem to be a problem for the Sanders campaign, which continues to do prodigious grass-roots fundraising.""Earlier, in a sweltering school lunchroom in Windsor Heights, a suburb of Des Moines, Clinton backers wooed their neighbors with offers of bottled water. A few miles away, in Clive, Sanders supporters ran out of seats so stood against the wall, beneath Sanders signs reading, ""A Future to Believe In.""""She has the experience, she has the knowledge, she is qualified, she will get things done,"" said Vicky Daniel, who caucused for Mrs. Clinton in Windsor Heights. She flew back to Iowa from her winter home in Florida to participate, and when Mrs. Clinton was announced the winner in her caucus, ""I said, `yes, yes, yes.'""But in Clive, west of Des Moines, Carol Ferrell, 59, decided at the last minute to support Mr. Sanders. ""As much as I admire Hillary Clinton, she's got a lot of baggage,"" she said.Mrs. Clinton's showing was an improvement over her third-place finish in Iowa eight years ago, which made clear that her once-inevitable campaign faced a serious threat from another challenger, then-Sen. Barack Obama.The Clinton campaign said it was well positioned for a long slog, and Mr. Sanders vowed to press on no matter the results.Both candidates were traveling overnight to New Hampshire to begin a weeklong sprint to the Granite state primary, where Mr. Sanders is 18 points ahead of Mrs. Clinton, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls.Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, is ahead in the states that come after that, and nationally. But the Sanders campaign believes a win in New Hampshire on top of a strong showing in Iowa would compel voters to give his campaign a second look.""We've done what we came to do, which is establish him as a serious candidate,"" Sanders strategist Tad Devine said Monday, before the caucuses.The Clinton campaign was bracing for a loss in New Hampshire, the state that rescued Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and revived Mrs. Clinton's 2008 effort.""There are a lot of headwinds in New Hampshire,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said, noting that candidates from neighboring states, like Mr. Sanders, have almost always won New Hampshire in recent years.But Mr. Mook said he feels optimistic looking ahead. He pointed to Mrs. Clinton's strong position in Nevada and South Carolina and in the swath of Southern states that will award a quarter of the delegates at stake on March 1. These states, where the Clinton campaign began organizing last summer, have more nonwhite voters than the states in the first two contests. Mrs. Clinton polls strongly among these voters and would continue to emphasize matters important to African-Americans, including her association with Mr. Obama, gun restrictions and the water crisis in Flint, Mich.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who has lagged far behind his competitors and had dwindling resources, suspended his campaign for the Democratic nomination after earning scant support in Iowa.Over dozens of trips to Iowa high schools and diners, in small discussions and big rallies, the two leading candidates engaged in a vigorous and sometimes sharp debate as Mrs. Clinton positioned herself as a pragmatic, can-do fighter, while Mr. Sanders appealed to the party's most deeply held ideals.She battled reports that classified material was sent via her private email system. He battled suggestions that he couldn't win a general election, and that he has no real plan to implement his agenda.Still, he inspired voters who said they were attracted to his rejection of big-money politics and promise of a ""political revolution."" He drew crowds to arenas and a loyal online following, where backers taunted detractors to ""feel the Bern.""In speeches that remained almost identical across months of campaigning, Mr. Sanders promised to break up large banks, said Wall Street is built on fraud and unapologetically vowed to impose higher taxes to provide universal health care, free tuition at public colleges and more generous Social Security benefits. At a rally Saturday, as Mr. Sanders ticked off society's problems, the crowd spontaneously began chanting, ""Enough is enough!""""He has an extraordinary amount of conviction,"" said Zachery Love, a 19-year-old University of Iowa student, one of more than 4,000 people to turn out for a Sanders concert and rally Saturday night.Mrs. Clinton, for her part, highlighted her perseverance and qualifications along with what she describes as a pragmatic, effective approach to governing. She also portrayed herself as the most electable candidate whose nomination is necessary to block Republican ideas.Her policy platform includes a new program for debt-free tuition and an increase in solar panels, as well as change in health care and Social Security that are more modest than her rival's.Her supporters, including many older women who grew up in a time of outright sex discrimination, say they are inspired by the idea of electing the first female president. And backers often say she is the most qualified candidate for the presidency they have ever encountered.On Monday night, Deidre Fudge arrived early to her West Des Moines caucus to register support for Mrs. Clinton. ""I'm just a little worried about Bernie and his naivete,"" Ms. Fudge said. ""I appreciate her experience and level-headedness about what can actually get done.""Credit: By Laura Meckler, Peter Nicholas and Colleen McCain Nelson",3/15/16
Clinton and Sanders Are Wrong on Fracking,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773380064?accountid=12768,"In addition to the economic and scientific hypocrisy of opposing fracking as outlined in your editorial ""Clinton Against American Energy"" (March 8), I find it ironic that the environmental opposition to fracking ignores the fact that the fracking-based natural gas revolution has resulted in the U.S. becoming the only nation in the world to reduce its CO2 footprint over the past 10 years. Instead of opposing fracking, we should be encouraging even more fracking and natural-gas consumption as we map a cost-competitive path to lower carbon emissions over the next few decades.Frank MurphySt. Louis---Of course Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are against fracking. When properly regulated by states, fracking has shown it is perfectly safe and doesn't pollute. But there remains the theoretical possibility that fracking will be unregulated and may pollute. So we should ban fracking with the good intention of avoiding any possibility of polluting? The consequences may be much higher energy prices which like a regressive tax would impact the poor the most. But this doesn't matter. These are progressive policies and to progressives it is only good intentions that matter. The consequences are irrelevant.Stephen R.S. MartinCave Creek, Ariz.---The reason fracking is supported by Democrats like Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper -- who holds a master's degree in geology -- is because hydraulic fracturing, with proper regulation, can be done safely. The Environmental Protection Agency has found that fracking doesn't contaminate groundwater resources.Secretary Clinton's assertion that her stipulations would greatly restrict fracking is blatantly untrue, unless she plans to implement much stricter standards.Isaac OrrThe Heartland InstituteSt. Paul, Minn.",3/16/16
Delegate Math Gets More Daunting for Bernie Sanders; Hillary Clinton's lead is bolstered with several wins,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773344287?accountid=12768,"Notching wins in at least four big contests Tuesday, Hillary Clinton is on track to become the Democratic presidential nominee, with a delegate lead large enough to withstand whatever challenge rival Bernie Sanders mounts before the voting wraps up in June.Mrs. Clinton captured the biggest prize of the night, winning Florida by more than 30 percentage points.

She led Mr. Sanders 768 to 554 in pledged delegates, coming off the 29 separate contests that preceded Tuesday's elections. Throw in the superdelegates--Democratic leaders and elected officials who are free to back whomever they choose--and her lead stood at 1,235 to 580.With Tuesday's partial results, Mrs. Clinton added at least 253 pledged delegates to her tally, while Mr. Sanders added 124 delegates.

How Sanders Exposed Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764619431?accountid=12768,"Democrats awoke Wednesday with a thought usually reserved for Republicans: Hillary Clinton is a disaster. The marvel is that she fooled them for so long.Picture Bernie Sanders as a small child in the court of Empress Clinton, and you have a modern twist on Hans Christian Andersen. The adoring Democratic townspeople oohed and aahed over their ""tough"" and ""experienced"" and ""masterful"" leader, the anointed heir to the Clinton throne. Then Bernie murmured what was obvious, and the crowd looked again.What they saw in New Hampshire was a dour, 68-year-old woman, shouting at her audience in her best impression of emotion. They saw a gaunt former president, rambling to half-empty forums, grumping about his wife's political opponent. They saw the candidate's surrogates try to snag the votes of young women by threatening them with eternal damnation. They saw a campaign in disarray, dragging carload upon carload of ethical baggage. They saw that the empress has no (or very few) clothes.No one knows whether Bernie Sanders can pull off a nomination. But what everyone does know now is that Hillary has (and is) a problem either way. Let's dispense with some spin: Bernie never had a lock on the Granite State. New Hampshire had stepped up for the Clintons twice before, in 1992 and 2008. This year Hillary went into the contest with endorsements, a huge operation and plenty of money.What she didn't have was the interest of voters. They'd had their eyes opened, and they chose to use their primary to highlight Mrs. Clinton's many and obvious political weaknesses. She may still be the favorite to hold her party's banner, but the mantle of inevitability has been stripped away.New Hampshire exposed again what a wooden candidate Hillary is. Mr. Sanders strolls on stage and makes his audience sing and cheer. Mrs. Clinton's events begin with propaganda videos about her past, followed by a tutorial on why she deserves this. They are heavy, and droning.She cannot do uplifting. She had the same likability problem in her 2000 race for the Senate, when she had to spend a fortune to beat an unknown Republican in liberal New York. The same problem popped up in 2008, against Barack Obama. Why anyone thought she would improve on a third go is a mystery.New Hampshire also uncovered the mismanagement that always attends the Clintons. Hillary wakes up every day with a new campaign. She ignores Mr. Sanders. Then she runs left. Then she attacks him. Then she softens. Her staff has endless debates, which always end up leaked to the press, about whether she needs to appear ""stronger,"" or more ""human,"" or ""sharper,"" or ""softer,"" or more ""pragmatic,"" or more ""lofty.""She has a habit of unceremoniously firing campaign teams. And this scattershot approach comes from a woman who has been plotting to be president for at least a decade? All this shifting may be another reason why the public sees her as ""untrustworthy.""To that point, New Hampshire proved that concerns about Mrs. Clinton's ethics aren't merely a right-wing talking point. They've permeated the electorate. Some stunning numbers: Among the one-third of Democratic primary voters who said ""honesty"" was the top quality they wanted in a nominee, Mr. Sanders won 91%. Among the quarter who said they focused on a candidate who ""cares about people like me,"" Mr. Sanders won 82%.Finally, New Hampshire exposed how out of touch the Clinton machine is with the modern liberal movement. Mrs. Clinton based her campaign on the tropes of a fading Democratic establishment. She figured that women would vote for her simply because she had the right anatomy. She figured that college grads and wealthier Democrats would vote for her because she had more pragmatic policies. She figured that the bulk of voters still viewed the Clinton operation as a sure ticket to the White House.In fairness, she won her age group -- those 65 or older, who grew up with the Clintons. But she lost everyone else: women, men, college grads, blue-collar workers. She lost every income level except those making more than $200,000. She lost liberals. And moderates.What makes Mrs. Clinton's miscalculation notable is that the party's shift was on full, neon view before she even entered the race. It was walking around in the form of Elizabeth Warren. The worry for Mrs. Clinton is that she might be unable to heal the rifts. Barack Obama's soaring rhetoric was able to reunite his party in 2008. Hillary doesn't have his skills.Responsibility for her crushing New Hampshire defeat can't be placed on Mrs. Clinton alone. Her party leadership is in it with her. Since 2008 the Clinton juggernaut has projected Hillary as the party's only option, and Democrats bought it. They closed their eyes to her flaws and scandals, ignored the shifting progressive winds, pushed potential rivals aside, and raved about the empress's lovely clothes. Then Bernie started whispering.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",3/17/16
"Election 2016: Clinton, Sanders Clash Over Cost of Plans --- Former secretary of state also questions the senator's loyalty to President Obama",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764615768?accountid=12768,"MILWAUKEE -- Hillary Clinton pressed Bernie Sanders on the viability of his proposals for free health care and college tuition in a Democratic presidential debate Thursday, and questioned his loyalty to President Barack Obama for past statements calling the president weak and a disappointment.In a wide-ranging exchange, the first after the candidates split victories in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the Democratic contenders agreed with each other more than they disagreed and appealed to the minority voters who will play a larger role in the next two races, in South Carolina and Nevada.Mrs. Clinton tethered herself to Mr. Obama, who remains enormously popular with the African-American voters she is relying on to help her campaign. She cast herself as the keeper of his legacy, repeatedly injected praise for his record and attacked Mr. Sanders for criticism he has leveled against the president.""The kind of criticism we've heard from Sen. Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans -- I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination,"" she said. ""That is a low blow,"" he replied, saying he has worked closely with Mr. Obama. But he added: ""Last I heard, we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard a U.S. senator had the right to disagree with the president. So I have voiced criticisms.""Mrs. Clinton said that disagreement was fine but Mr. Sanders went too far suggesting a primary challenge to him in 2011, calling him weak and a disappointment. The Vermont senator's final retort, harking back to the 2008 Democratic primary: ""One of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.""The debate elicited few surprises and revealed no significant change in tactics by either camp that could shift the dynamics of what appears to be a highly competitive fight for the Democratic Party presidential nomination that isn't likely to be resolved for months.Mr. Sanders didn't hesitate to stand by his proposal to impose new taxes on the wealthy and Wall Street to provide new government services. However, he appeared to have no reply when the former secretary of state pointed out that his education proposal would require Republican governors to spend more money to make it happen.Mr. Sanders's plan ""rests on making sure that governors, like Scott Walker [of Wisconsin], contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I'm a little skeptical,"" she said, to loud applause.An unexpected historical figure made his way into the debate: Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state and national security adviser under President Richard Nixon. Mr. Sanders sought to put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive, noting that she has said she has taken advice from Mr. Kissinger and citing his role in the secret bombings of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.""I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I'm proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.""Mrs. Clinton struck back, seeking to portray Mr. Sanders as unprepared for the world's foreign policy challenges. ""Journalists have asked, who do you listen to on policy and we have yet to know who that is,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger, that's for sure,"" Mr. Sanders said.While the exchange seemed an unusual detour, the Sanders campaign followed it with a memo to reporters detailing its view on Kissinger's policies.The debate opened with a tense exchange over one of the pair's sharpest policy differences -- Mr. Sanders's proposal to create a single-payer health-care system that would replace private insurance with a government-funded system.Mr. Sanders said it is imperative for the U.S. to guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege. Mrs. Clinton questioned his assertion that a typical American family will see $500 more in taxes while saving $5,000 in health-care costs.""The numbers don't add up,"" she said. ""That's a promise that cannot be kept.""Mr. Sanders responded by speaking of a general imperative. ""Here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton replied that the U.S. system is fundamentally different from European countries, which have government systems, and that the Affordable Care Act was meant to build on the employer-based system in place.Mrs. Clinton suggested that her opponent was promising more than he could deliver as president and would plunge the country back into another protracted debate over health care: ""We have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why we should not make promises we can't keep.""She said she has specified what her proposals would cost -- $100 billion a year. ""Once I'm in the White House, we will have enough political capital"" to close tax loopholes and raise taxes on wealthy Americans -- steps that would pay for her programs, she said.In reply, Mr. Sanders seized on her prediction that she will be the next president. ""Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet,"" he said.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Laura Meckler and Peter Nicholas",3/17/16
Sanders Urges Treasury to Set Tax Restrictions on Inversion Deals; The presidential candidate's proposed tax rules would threaten Pfizer's merger with Allergan,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774195218?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is urging the Treasury Department to impose new tax rules that could halt Pfizer Inc.'s proposed merger with Allergan PLC , or at least make it more expensive.In a letter sent Friday from his Senate office, Mr. Sanders asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to prevent Pfizer and other companies that take foreign tax addresses from borrowing against stockpiled foreign earnings without paying U.S. taxes. He also wants Treasury to limit ""earnings stripping,"" the intercompany maneuvers companies use after taking a non-U.S. address to load up their U.S. operations with subsidiaries and shift profits to low-tax foreign countries.""Large multinational corporations should not be able to avoid paying U.S. taxes when children in America go hungry,""wrote Mr. Sanders , a Vermont senator. ""Blocking this inversion would not only be sound fiscal policy, it would also act as a strong deterrent to other companies that are contemplating similar tax scams.""Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman, declined to comment.Inversions are transactions in which U.S. companies take foreign addresses, typically by merging with a smaller foreign firm. Stopping them has become a populist cause for Democrats , and both Mr. Sanders and front-runner Hillary Clinton have detailed legislative plans to curb the transactions. Most Republicans, by contrast, favor a broader revamp of the tax system that lowers the corporate tax rate and lightens the tax burden on U.S. companies' foreign income.That disagreement led to stalemate in Congress. In that breach, the Treasury Department has been imposing regulations --and companies have been looking for ways around them.Pfizer, which announced the planned merger and move to Ireland headquarters in November 2015, would become the largest U.S. company to exit the country. The company says its adjusted tax rate after the merger will be 17% to 18%, down from about 24% now. The scheduled closing date is the second half of 2016.Under current law, U.S. companies owe U.S. taxes on their world-wide income. They get tax credits for payments to foreign governments. They then owe the U.S. the remainder of the 35% tax rate, but only when they bring the money home. That leads companies to stockpile low-taxed profits abroad and look for ways to escape the U.S. tax net.As of Dec. 31, Pfizer had approximately $160 billion in accumulated offshore profits on which it hasn't paid U.S. taxes. After the inversion, future profits outside the U.S. wouldn't face any U.S. tax, but the company couldn't simply distribute the built-up past earnings to shareholders without paying the U.S. tax. It could, however, use what's known as a ""hopscotch loan"" to use those profits indirectly.The Treasury Department has issued two notices that make it harder for companies to benefit from inversions, including restrictions on so-called hopscotch loans. But those rules only apply in cases where shareholders of the U.S. company own at least 60% of the combined firm. The Pfizer deal is structured so that Pfizer shareholders own 56%.Mr. Sanders is relying on an argument promoted by Stephen Shay of Harvard University . In Tax Notes last month, Mr. Shay, along with two other law professors, outlined how the government could use existing regulatory authority to limit such loans. Mr. Shay was the top international tax lawyer at Treasury earlier in the Obama administration.A Treasury spokesman said Friday that the department has received the letter and will respond as appropriate.The Treasury Department has said it is working on the formal regulations that would implement the notices it released in 2014 and 2015. Mr. Lew said in November that the government was exploring more ideas and intended to take further actions in the coming months. The government has struggled to find effective constraints within its existing legal authority while at the same time avoid burdening what it sees as legitimate business transactions.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comCredit: By Richard Rubin",3/18/16
"Hillary's and Bernie's Pie-in-the-Sky Social Security Proposals; Promising better benefits and higher taxes, including on investments.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774045530?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have squared off in what progressive author James W. Russell recently called ""the Democratic Party's increasingly central debate over expansion of Social Security."" Challenged by Mr. Sanders to join him in promising ""never to cut Social Security,"" Mrs. Clinton tweeted a response: ""I won't cut Social Security. As always, I'll defend it, & I'll expand it. Enough false innuendos."" Nevertheless, the reforms they propose would change the program in fundamental but different ways.Both candidates want massive tax increases, but not by increasing the payroll tax rate, the traditional means for buttressing Social Security finances. Instead, they would put all the financial burden on high-income earners. Mr. Sanders would eliminate, over 17 years, the $118,500 ceiling on which payroll taxes are levied. He also would immediately apply a 6.2% tax on investment income to households with incomes above $250,000. Mrs. Clinton is more circumspect but has recently spoken in favor of both approaches .The maximum earnings subject to the payroll tax would be raised, but--and this is significant--without increasing the benefits eventually paid out to those who pay more in. Moreover, for the first time, non-wage income would be taxed.What sets Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders apart is how they increase benefits. Mrs. Clinton would raise retirement payments for widows as well as provide Social Security credits for individuals who take time out of the workforce to care for a child or an infirm adult. Mr. Sanders would increase the basic benefit for most retirees, raise cost-of-living adjustments, and institute a new minimum benefit for long-career low earners. Overall, Mr. Sanders's proposed benefit increases are nearly three times as large as Mrs. Clinton's.But Mrs. Clinton's benefit increases are more ""progressive."" I analyzed both proposals using the Policy Simulation Group's microsimulation models, which are used by the Social Security Administration, Government Accountability Office and Labor Department. Under Mrs. Clinton's plan, about 57% of the total dollar increase in benefits would flow to the bottom two-fifths of households, with 21% received by the top two quintiles of households. Under Mr. Sanders's plan, 35% of total benefit increases flow to the bottom two-fifths of households while 44% go to the top two-fifths.These differences derive from the not-entirely-progressive provisions of Mr. Sanders's benefit increases. For instance, Social Security currently replaces 90% of an individual's first $10,272 in average pre-retirement earnings, with lower replacement rates for earnings above that level. Mr. Sanders raises the annual earnings covered by that 90% replacement rate to about $11,800. This boosts benefits progressively for individuals with earnings above $10,272, but individuals with earnings below $10,272 receive no benefit increase. Mr. Sanders also institutes a minimum benefit of 125% of the poverty threshold for workers with 30 years of earnings, but those with shorter careers--who are usually poorer--receive less. Higher cost-of-living adjustments also tend to benefit wealthier, longer-lived retirees.Despite increased taxes, neither proposal would shore up Social Security's long-term funding deficits. These currently range from $10 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 75 years, according to various government estimates.The Sanders plan, according to Social Security Administration actuaries, would close about 82% of the program's long-term deficit as scored by the Social Security's Trustees. But it would fix only about half of the larger shortfall as projected by the Congressional Budget Office.Mrs. Clinton's more restrained benefit increases would probably let her approach 75-year solvency under the assumptions made by the Social Security Trustees, but still fall well short of addressing larger projected shortfalls estimated by the CBO, or by a recent Technical Panel appointed by the bipartisan Social Security Advisory Board. In any event, both presidential contenders would raise the effective top marginal tax rate by 12 percentage points.SSA actuaries assume that upper-income individuals would not work less in response to higher payroll taxes--but the SSA and the CBO do assume that if employers must pay 6.2% tax on their employees' earnings above $118,500, they will reduce employee wages to cover the extra costs. Those lost employee earnings would no longer be subject to federal income taxes, state income taxes, or Medicare payroll taxes. In short, while Social Security might gain $2.4 trillion over 10 years, the rest of the budget would lose nearly half a trillion dollars in revenues over that time.It's unclear how popular either proposal would be in the general election. Americans don't want Scandinavian levels of taxation and certainly not, in Mr. Sanders's case, to pay higher benefits to mostly higher-income households.A well-designed but fiscally conservative Social Security reform could compete with either plan. For instance, a flat poverty-level retirement benefit paid to all, coupled with expanded access to 401(k)s, could eliminate poverty in old age, increase retirement saving, and make Social Security solvent at almost one-third lower cost than Mr. Sanders's plan, eliminating the 12.4% payroll tax on retirees who continue to work.Mr. Biggs is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

"Bernie Sanders Keeps Up Pressure; Hillary Clinton Looks to Pad Delegate Lead; Vermont senator goes on the offensive, with Ohio being key battleground among Tuesday's five primaries",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773288914?accountid=12768,"RALEIGH, N.C--Sen. Bernie Sanders ramped up criticism of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton heading into Tuesday's primary contests , but it was unclear how long he could sustain such attacks if her delegate lead keeps growing.Mr. Sanders was promising to take his campaign all the way to the party convention this summer, whatever Tuesday's outcome. But he may face increasing pressure from Democrats not to harm their likely nominee if he continues to go after Mrs. Clinton for her ties to Wall Street, her record of support for free-trade agreements and the backing she receives from an outside super PAC.Mrs. Clinton, who alternates between sharp attacks of her own and above-the-fray calls for unity, suggested Tuesday she isn't bothered by the swipes and is instead focused on building her delegate lead.""I absolutely respect Sen. Sanders,"" the former secretary of state and New York senator said after greeting voters here. ""He has a right to run his campaign in any way he chooses. And I'm proud of the campaign that he and I have run because we've actually focused on the issues.""Coming into Tuesday's voting, Mrs. Clinton had a commanding lead: Her 768 pledged delegates, those chosen by voters, was 214 more than Mr. Sanders. Including so-called superdelegates, who are party leaders who can vote for anyone, she had 1,235--more than double her rival's take and more than half the number needed for the nomination, according to a tally by the Associated Press.Five states were voting on Tuesday, including marquee contests in Ohio and Florida, as well as Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina.Mrs. Clinton's advantage was on display Tuesday in Miami, home to large populations of Hispanic and African-American voters who have gravitated to her campaign.""I like that she's a smart, charismatic woman,"" said Bridgette Thornton, a 37-year-old African-American attorney, who cast her ballot at a Miami church. ""It was a difficult choice for me, but I'm a practical person. Hillary has a better shot at winning the presidential election.""Both campaigns saw Mr. Sanders's chances as better in Ohio, where he has hammered home his anti-free-trade views in recent days. Mrs. Clinton has tried to recast her trade message, but the attempt fell flat with at least some voters.""The Clinton history with trade policies, that really just killed our area,"" said Fred Woke, a 57-year-old radio announcer who voted for Mr. Sanders in Niles, in northeastern Ohio.Mr. Sanders hopes his arguments similarly resonate in coming battlegrounds. ""In the states that are coming down the pike, we have great opportunities to win many of them, so we're feeling really good,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters in Chicago on Tuesday.Earlier in the race, Mr. Sanders vowed to avoid negative attacks, but he has amped up his critique in the weeks since voting began. On the stump leading into Tuesday's voting, he suggested Mrs. Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and connected her support for free-trade agreements to an exodus of manufacturing jobs across the Midwest.The challenge for both Democrats is that Donald Trump, should he win the Republican nomination, would be an unconventional opponent who could pick up some of Mr. Sanders's populist arguments.That has some Clinton backers anxious for Mr. Sanders to ease up.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 News.* Live Coverage: Tuesday's Primaries* In Illinois, Clinton and Sanders Vie for Obama Legacy* More GOP Suits Seek Records From Clinton's Term at State Department* Donald Trump Looks to Cinch Fast Track to GOP Nomination* Ted Cruz Pins Hopes on a Convention Fight* Obama Warns 2016 Campaign Marring U.S. Reputation""The message of Sanders campaign has become personal attacks,"" said Robert Zimmerman, a superdelegate from New York who backs Mrs. Clinton. ""It's not only wrong, it's dangerous politically if he keeps up that tone. It could hurt plans for party unity and empower Republicans.""Steve Elmendorf, a political consultant who backs Mrs. Clinton, agreed there will come a point when Mr. Sanders needs to let up, but he said it isn't for Clinton supporters to say when. ""When it becomes clear you cannot win, then you should unite behind the nominee of the party and try to beat the Republicans,"" Mr. Elmendorf said. ""It's for him to decide when he can't win.""In 2008, Mrs. Clinton herself continued to compete in presidential-primary contests against then-Sen. Barack Obama even though he remained ahead in the delegate race the entire time.""Even if he doesn't think he will win the nomination, he's trying to amass as many delegates as he can,"" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. Delegates would give Mr. Sanders leverage at the party's convention and demonstrate the strength of his movement, Mr. Trippi said, adding, ""I don't see him relenting.""Sanders aides see a narrow path to the nomination and say the senator will continue to fight for it. They see potential wins in Arizona next week, followed by New York in April and on the West Coast in May and June. Each Sanders win accentuates Mrs. Clinton's vulnerabilities, his aides say, and could persuade superdelegates that Mr. Sanders would be the strongest Democratic candidate this fall.His fervent supporters, who continue to fill arenas, also hope he presses forward.""I think that you need to fight the fight 'til the end,"" said Cindy Figh, 50, a massage therapist from Lithia, Fla., who shaved the name ""Bernie"" into her hair and came to see the senator speak last week in Tampa. ""I just think that there's a chance that he can pull it off.""She rejected any suggestion that Mr. Sanders might damage Mrs. Clinton, whom she plans to support if she wins the nomination. ""I think that this is part of politics,"" Ms. Figh said. ""We're in the big-boy playground now, and sometimes your ball gets taken away.""Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant in Florida who voted for Mrs. Clinton though he was hoping to work for Vice President Joe Biden in this race, said he doesn't worry that the Sanders attacks will damage Mrs. Clinton, partly because Democrats are sure to unify if Mr. Trump is the nominee.""You want to get Democrats over the Sanders-Clinton thing, give them five seconds to think about Trump being within five feet of the nuclear codes,"" Mr. Schale said.He said he saw no mathematical way for Mr. Sanders to overcome Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead, and said a protracted primary fight would occupy time that the Clinton campaign could be using to prepare for the general election.""If Hillary Clinton has to go debate Bernie Sanders in New York, and compete in Indiana and California, that means the campaign is not spending time thinking about building organizations in Ohio and Colorado and Florida,"" he said.President Barack Obama has suggested that he, too, could bring the Democratic Party together once the primary battle concludes. Mr. Obama previously had raised the prospect of making an endorsement in the Democratic primary, but he has since backed off that idea, saying last week that Democratic voters are doing a fine job.""It's been a good conversation,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And my most important role will be to make sure that after the primary is done I'm bringing everybody together so that we focus on winning the general election.""Arian Campo-Flores and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",3/18/16
The Zero-Sum Worlds of Trump and Sanders; Both presidential candidates support long-discredited economic policies.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774431614?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders might seem unlikely economic soul mates, but they share a mistaken reliance on zero-sum thinking and long-discredited economic policies.Mr. Trump's anti-immigration and anti-trade positions make him essentially a disciple of mercantilism--a protectionist economic theory refuted by Adam Smith in 1776. Bernie Sanders proudly calls himself a socialist and advocates vast increases in taxes and government power. The history of the past century, from the Soviet Union's fall to the impending collapse of Venezuela, amply shows that a socialist economy isn't only ""rigged""--to borrow one of Mr. Sanders's favorite words--it doesn't work.Messrs. Trump and Sanders have been led astray by zero-sum thinking, or the assumption that economic magnitudes are fixed when they are in fact variable.If the world is zero-sum, then the number of jobs is fixed, as is gross domestic product. In Mr. Trump's mind, if there are more Mexican workers in the U.S., then American workers must lose their jobs. In the real, positive-sum world where Mr. Trump doesn't live, Mexican workers also consume, thus increasing GDP and creating new jobs.Moreover, the reason that firms hire immigrant workers is to lower costs, and this leads to lower prices for consumers, allowing them to purchase additional goods--adding new jobs to the U.S. economy. But in a fixed world prices do not change, so this effect is ignored.Similar arguments apply to Mr. Trump's analysis of Chinese imports. In a world of fixed GDP and prices, imports of goods from China merely replace goods that otherwise would have been produced by American workers. In the real world, imports reduce prices and increase GDP, so workers, who are also consumers, benefit from imports of lower-cost goods and increase their consumption of other goods.Mr. Sanders's economics is also zero-sum, although he emphasizes a different aspect of the fallacy. In a zero-sum world, taxes don't matter much because people work the same amount anyway, so there are no losses from reduced effort in response to higher taxes. Similarly, in a zero-sum world methods of production are given, so there are no responses to changing prices--higher minimum wages don't lead to layoffs, for example. (In the real world, we saw Wal-Mart's recent store closings following wage increases.) In the Bernie Sanders universe, the size of the economy is fixed so there is plenty to redistribute no matter how misguided the economic policies.Zero-sum thinking persists because it is superficially appealing. Mr. Trump's policies would in theory benefit Americans and increase jobs. Mr. Sanders's policies would make the poor better off. In the actual, positive-sum world we live in, their policies--building a fence along the Mexican border, disrupting labor markets by deporting millions of productive workers, huge tariffs on imported goods, much higher income taxes and minimum wages--would, if adopted, lead to an economic depression that would make the 1930s look prosperous.Mr. Rubin, an economics professor at Emory University and a senior fellow at the Classical Liberal Institute at New York University, is the author of ""Darwinian Politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom"" (Rutgers Press, 2002).Credit: By Paul H.

Bernie Sanders's Team Still Sees Path to 'Win This Game' After Poor Results; Clinton campaign says she has 'nearly insurmountable' lead,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773560363?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Coming off a bad night, Sen. Bernie Sanders's top aides professed no concern in the face of an increasingly difficult path to the Democratic nomination, saying the race is only half over and their candidate will win the contests to come.""We agree that we're behind but we also think we're going to win this game. We see a path to get there,"" said chief strategist Tad Devine. ""The back end of this process is as favorable to Bernie as the front end was to Hillary.""Fresh off its wins Tuesday, the Hillary Clinton campaign struck a confident tone, calling Mrs. Clinton's lead in delegates to the national convention ""nearly insurmountable"" and said Mr. Sanders would have to win huge states by lopsided margins to catch up.The Sanders campaign said it sees opportunities for victories next week in Arizona's primary and in a string of caucuses in the coming weeks, including Idaho and Utah, where the Vermont senator plans to campaign in the coming days.Aides hope he can surpass Mrs. Clinton with big wins in New York in April and California in June.It will be a steep and perhaps impossible climb. Losses Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Illinois made Mr. Sanders's already large deficit even deeper. He also trails by 0.2 percentage point in the night's fifth state, Missouri, which the Associated Press has deemed too close to call. The Sanders campaign said it hadn't decided whether to ask for a recount.Mrs. Clinton's lead among pledged delegates, those chosen by the voters, has grown to 314--with her claiming a total of 1,132 to his 818 .That is more than double any lead that then-Sen. Barack Obama enjoyed in 2008. Democratic Party rules allocate delegates proportionately, meaning it is very difficult for a candidate to catch up once he or she has fallen significantly behind, because even the loser wins a share of the pie in each contest.Mrs. Clinton's advantage is even more imposing when superdelegates, who can vote for anyone they like, are included in the totals. In that case, she has 1,599 to Mr. Sanders's 844 , according to a tally by the Associated Press. A total of 2,383 is needed to clinch the nomination.In a public memorandum Wednesday, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook allowed that Mr. Sanders may win several upcoming contests, but he said it won't matter.""Looking ahead to the rest of March, Sen. Sanders is poised to have a stretch of very favorable states vote, including five caucuses next week, which he is likely to win,"" he wrote. ""But our pledged delegate lead is so significant that even a string of victories by Sen. Sanders over the next few weeks would have little impact on Sec. Clinton's position in the race.""To erase the Clinton delegate lead, Mr. Mook said, the Vermont senator would need to score double-digit victories of his own in states like New York, California and Pennsylvania, which account for 45% of the remaining delegates--and even that may not be enough.The Sanders team said its strategy was focused on winning pledged delegates in contests to come. The campaign's Mr. Devine also sketched out a novel plan to look for delegates in caucus states that have already voted, saying the rules allow campaigns to add to their totals as the process moves to the county and then to the state level. He also said pledged delegates aren't required to vote for the person they were elected to represent if the race changes.""The numbers are not set in stone,"" he said.Mr. Devine also argued that superdelegates--party leaders who can vote for whomever they like--can be persuaded to back Mr. Sanders if they see Mrs. Clinton lose contests this spring and can be persuaded Mr. Sanders is the stronger general election candidate.That, too, may be a tough case given that party leaders are the very people Mr. Sanders regularly derides as part of the ""establishment"" he seeks to overturn.It also will be a challenge if Mrs. Clinton maintains the lead among the pledged delegates who are selected by voters. Liberal groups including MoveOn.org have pushed to reduce the power of superdelegates, but their point is that the party leaders shouldn't overrule the voters.As the campaign presses forward, some Democrats could grow annoyed if Mr. Sanders continues his pointed barbs at Mrs. Clinton. But Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said he thinks the criticism is valid.""I anticipate the tone will remain the same,"" he said. ""There are important differences between Secretary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. It's incumbent upon us and them to point out where those differences are.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler",3/21/16
"Bernie Sanders Seeks to Dent Hillary Clinton's Delegate Lead as Race Moves West; Vermont senator is looking for a second wind going into Tuesday's contests in Arizona, Idaho and Utah",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774989413?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders entered Tuesday's Democratic contests in urgent need of both lopsided wins and a strategy for broadening his coalition beyond the young and largely white group of voters who have boosted him so far.With about half the primary season over, Tuesday's contests in Arizona, Idaho and Utah marked the first test for the Vermont senator in what his campaign has argued would be more favorable terrain in Western states.But Mr. Sanders is limping into this leg of the race.Hillary Clinton swept through the South, then won all five states that held primaries last week. While Mr. Sanders has predicted that he would prevail in the second half of the Democratic primary fight, a look at the calendar reveals limited opportunities for the Vermont senator to eat into Mrs. Clinton's lead, which stands at more than 300 among pledged delegates and 440 among superdelegates.Mr. Sanders could score several victories in Western states and beyond. But narrowing Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead, which was built in part on substantial victory margins in the South, will require him to notch landslides that produce big shares of the available delegates.An examination of the 28 contests stretching from now until mid-June shows opportunities for Mrs. Clinton to hold her lead or even build on it. As a presidential candidate in 2008, she faced off against then-Sen. Barack Obama in each of those states. She won 12 contests; Mr. Obama won 16.But her 12 victories came in states and one territory, Puerto Rico, that in the 2016 primaries account for more than 1,400 delegates. By contrast, the 16 contests she lost in her last campaign offer only about 600 delegates this year.How Mrs. Clinton fared in 2008 is instructive, because she is holding the vast majority of states she won last time around. She carried states such as Ohio, Texas, Tennessee, Massachusetts and Arkansas both in 2008 and this year.To assess how the next phase of the race suits Mrs. Clinton, consider California. The state's June primary will allocate the biggest prize of the entire race, 475 delegates. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton won California easily, defeating Mr. Obama by eight points.Exit polls from that contest show an electorate that would seem amenable to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 candidacy, with African-American and Hispanic voters accounting for 37% of the electorate. Mrs. Clinton has shown she performs best in states with large minority voting blocs.Mr. Sanders's campaign has remained focused on every opportunity to make up ground. On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, touted the campaign's win in the primary among Democrats Abroad--a contest that netted the Vermont senator five more delegates than Mrs. Clinton.""This is the result we needed,"" Mr. Weaver wrote in a fundraising email. ""Now the map shifts in our favor, and we're going to begin clawing back delegates in state after state until we capture the lead on June 7th,"" the last major day of primary voting.Mr. Sanders has done well in states that are more liberal and mostly white, and he will find that in many Western states. What's more, several of the next contests are caucuses, which have yielded favorable results for Mr. Sanders.Stan Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, said the race increasingly appears to be settled, making it difficult for Mr. Sanders to change the basic dynamic. The Vermont senator's failure to win any contest last week could prove to be a defining moment in this campaign, Mr. Greenberg said.""He lost momentum at that point, and we entered the endgame,"" he said. ""Unless there's a huge surprise, it's not going to happen.""More in Election 2016* Five Things to Watch in Tuesday's Election Contests (March 22)* Brussels Attacks Will Jolt 2016 U.S. Presidential Race (March 22)* Sanders Strives for Comeback in Arizona Primary (March 21)* Clinton Denounces Trump Before Pro-Israel Lobby Group (March 21)David Wasserman, a delegate analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, wrote recently that Mr. Sanders could string together several victories in the West and then stall in the more diverse Northeastern states that follow. ""If there is bad news for Clinton, it's that the next month of primaries could give the false impression that Sanders is on track for a big comeback,"" Mr. Wasserman wrote.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has described the former secretary of state's delegate lead as ""nearly insurmountable."" Mrs. Clinton, speaking Tuesday in Everett, Wash., also touted her lead.""I have gotten 2.6 million more votes than Bernie Sanders,'' she said. ""I have a bigger lead in pledged delegates, the ones you win from people voting, than Barack Obama had at this time in 2008. So we are on the path to the nomination.""In Arizona , which held its Democratic primary Tuesday, many voters still were standing by Mr. Sanders.Jordan West, 24, a preschool teacher from Phoenix, said Mr. Sanders is best able to make a difference in the lives of the less fortunate. ""He's a compassionate person,"" Ms. West said. ""I think we need a compassionate leader. There's a lot of hate.""But even some of the Vermont senator's most enthusiastic backers aren't convinced that he can overcome Mrs. Clinton's lead.""I think he should stay in it as long as possible,"" said Ayla Carlsted, a 28-year-old Sanders supporter who lives in the Phoenix area. ""He's making so much change and he needs to make as much change as he possibly can.

An Empty Obama-Clinton-Sanders Plan on Drug Costs; Requiring drug-by-drug data on R&D spending shows a misunderstanding of how my industry works.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774654778?accountid=12768,"President Obama's latest budget includes proposals--echoed or one-upped on the presidential-campaign trail by Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton--that would require pharmaceutical companies to release data on the cost of research and development (R&D) and the extent of discounts offered to insurers for each drug brought to market. Yet the key numbers already are disclosed freely--and we know how to get better value from medicines and improve their affordability to patients.The company I lead, Lilly, discloses its annual R&D spending in audited financial statements every year, like other public companies. Lilly's number for 2015 was $4.8 billion--part of the $50 billion invested in R&D each year by the members of our industry association alone. That's more than 20% of all R&D spending by all U.S. businesses. Seen against that staggering total, the proposal to mandate the nearly impossible task of assembling drug-by-drug R&D-spending figures misses the whole point.Pharmaceutical companies' R&D feeds innovation from the earliest identification of leads through to clinical trials, real-world data collection and the refinement of existing treatments. It includes the cost of myriad failures--part of every scientific enterprise--along with further research on approved medicines, right up to their patent expirations. Money made on the sale of today's new medicines feeds all of the indispensable streams in this complex ecosystem.Averages are easy enough to come by--a new academic study in the Journal of Health Economics says it takes about $2.6 billion in R&D investment per new medicine launched. Calculating a precise number for an individual product is quite another matter. Consider Lilly's investment of billions of dollars in R&D related to Alzheimer's disease over the last quarter century. Since there are several candidates in our pipeline that emerged from past work, to which future product and in what proportion should these costs be allocated? And to what end?The key insight is beyond dispute. Developing medicines is risky, expensive and time-consuming, and everyone would be better off if it were less so. Rather than meaningless disclosure mandates, policy efforts instead should encourage whatever can be done, without compromising patient safety, to shave precious weeks off development and regulatory-approval timelines.There are effective ways to do that. For example, pooling access to potential new molecules and sharing ""pre-competitive"" research on promising treatment paths could avoid costly duplication. Industry and the FDA could ramp up the use of ""adaptive clinical trials"" that refocus themselves based on real-time findings rather than starting over. And large-scale efforts to capture the real-world outcomes of treatments in genetically profiled patients--and feed these insights back to R&D labs--would accelerate progress significantly.Mandating further disclosure of discounts negotiated by drug companies also is a route to nowhere. Lest anyone doubt that the discounts are substantial, allow me to report freely that the average net prices paid last year by Lilly's customers in the U.S. ranged from a high of 67% of list prices paid by commercial health plans to a low of 19% paid by government purchasers including Medicaid. That's right: The average discount off list price was more than 80% for government payers.I'm not cherry-picking these figures--they cover Lilly's entire portfolio of established products. But forcing Lilly, or other companies, to disclose product-by-product and payer-by-payer discounts would be an unprecedented affront to free-market competition.The list prices of medicines that feed media sensationalism are paid by essentially no institutional or government buyer in a hotly competitive marketplace. Yet affordability remains a problem for many patients. That's because insured patients in the U.S. today pay an average of about 20% of their prescription-drug costs out-of-pocket compared with about 5% of their hospital costs. Some patients' cost shares are much worse--due to complex insurance ""tier"" systems for drugs and the rise of ""combined deductibles,"" in which drug expenses get lumped together with major-medical costs, and benefits hinge on reaching a high expense threshold.The insurance bias against medicines needs to be addressed head-on, at the very least so that patients benefit from the savings negotiated by their insurers. Clearing the Food and Drug Administration's huge backlog of generic-drug applications would also be a great help.Lilly and Anthem, a major insurer, recently asked for changes in federal regulations that make it difficult to set up ""outcomes-based contracts."" These would link payment for a drug to the presentation of evidence that patients achieved the health benefits expected from the drug, for example.The realities that determine the cost of medicines to patients don't require mandated disclosures. They are as plain as day. They simply need to be acknowledged and acted upon rather than distorted and ignored.Dr. Lechleiter, a chemist, is chairman, president and CEO of Eli Lilly and Company.Credit: By John C.

"Bernie Sanders Strives for Comeback in Arizona Primary; Democratic presidential candidate, far behind front-runner Hillary Clinton, has devoted most of past week to the state",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774652272?accountid=12768,"PHOENIX--Sen. Bernie Sanders, lagging far behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential race, is looking for a comeback in Arizona, where he has spent the better part of the past week campaigning ahead of Tuesday's primary.Both campaigns are working hard for the state, with rallies, multiple television ads and high-profile surrogates. They have also waged another round in their battle over who has the best record on immigration, an issue of particular concern here.But Mr. Sanders has invested far more personal attention, with events almost every day over the past week, a trip to the U.S.-Mexican border and special attention to the Native American community.""As I look around here, I see a lot of energy, I see a lot of beauty, I see a lot of enthusiasm,"" Mr. Sanders told more than 3,000 people at a weekend rally. ""And I see a lot of people who are going to transform the United States.""In a fundraising appeal emailed Monday, campaign manager Jeff Weaver told supporters, ""Tomorrow night is a very important night for our campaign.""Tuesday will also feature Democratic caucuses in Idaho and Utah, and both camps say Mr. Sanders has the advantage in those two states.After last week's sweep of five big-state primaries, top Clinton aides have argued that her delegate lead is so significant that it is now almost impossible for Mr. Sanders to catch up.Limited public polling suggests Mrs. Clinton is ahead in Arizona. She is helped by rules that limit participation in the party primary to Democrats, given Mr. Sanders's appeal to independent voters. The state's demographics may also help: Older voters are among her strongest supporters, and in 2008, nearly four in 10 voters were age 60 and over.Mr. Sanders has performed best with white voters, who in 2008 made up 68% of Arizona's Democratic primary. The nonwhite population in Arizona is smaller than it was in the Southern states where Mrs. Clinton dominated, but still higher than most of the states where Mr. Sanders has scored wins.The Vermont senator has built his Arizona campaign around appeals to both Hispanics and Native Americans.Over the weekend, he held a news conference along the Mexican border in Nogales, where he criticized the idea of a border fence and slammed the federal government's deportation policies. ""We don't need a wall, and we don't need barbed wire,"" he said, standing in front of a tall barrier that separates the U.S. from Mexico. ""We need to fix our broken criminal justice system.""His wife, Jane Sanders, spent most of last week here, participating in small group discussions with tribes and visiting the Tent City jail run by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is nationally known for his crusade against illegal immigration. It was her first extended solo campaign trip.At the jail, she ran into Mr. Arpaio, who gave her a brief tour with local TV cameras in tow. She then met privately with local families. During their discussion, Mr. Arpaio let her know he was supporting Republican Donald Trump.""I'm just going from sun up to sun down,"" she said in an interview last week.For her part, Mrs. Clinton looked beyond her primary battle with Mr. Sanders during a rally in a Phoenix high school on Monday afternoon. She instead trained her fire at Republican front-runner Donald Trump, without mentioning him by name.""It's been deeply distressing to me to see the divisiveness, the mean-spiritedness, the incitement of violence, the aggressiveness in this campaign,"" said Mrs. Clinton. ""I don't ever remember anything like it.""On the airwaves, Mrs. Clinton is highlighting issues including immigration and gun control. One spot features a young girl fearful that her parents will be deported, with Mrs. Clinton emotionally promising to do the worrying for her. A second ad has former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was critically wounded by a gunshot to her head during a constituent event in 2011, saying Mrs. Clinton will ""stand up to the gun lobby.""The third Clinton ad is about education, an issue that is particularly important to Hispanic voters.The state's early voting program tends to favor the front-runners, and as of Monday, about 300,000 ballots had been cast in the Democratic primary. That compares with about 455,000 total votes in the 2008 primary.""If you look at the ballots that have come in thus far, it seems to me that the race should be tilting towards Hillary,"" said DJ Quinlan, former executive director of the Arizona Democratic Party who has been neutral in the race since his first choice, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, dropped out.For Mr. Sanders, a victory is critical to maintaining enthusiasm for his campaign in the face of his steep delegate climb. Sanders aides argue he can win the nomination if he scores big wins in New York in April and California in June. That is a tough order, even under the best of circumstances, and impossible if his support wanes.Meantime, a win here is important for the Clinton campaign to blunt any momentum that Mr. Sanders might get if he wins a string of coming caucuses, including Idaho and Utah on Tuesday, and Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state next week.The former secretary of state may have the nomination in hand in either case, but her campaign hopes to close out the primary period on a positive note.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Byron Tau",3/22/16
What if Bernie Sanders Gets Wall Street Tax?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765230479?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to raise a lot of money from Wall Street.Mr. Sanders's plan isn't to ask Wall Street for money; it is to demand it in the form of a financial-transaction tax.Proponents say the tax would collect tens of billions of dollars, discourage speculative and high-frequency trading and make markets safer and less volatile. Its opponents say the revenue estimates are overstated and the tax will actually make markets more volatile.The Democratic presidential candidate wants to use funds raised by this tax to pay for his college-education agenda, which includes making public colleges free, cutting interest rates on student loans and increasing financial aid. The costs of these proposals -- $75 billion a year by Mr. Sanders's count -- could be fully paid for by the tax, according to Mr. Sanders.Under a bill Mr. Sanders introduced last May, investors would be required to pay an excise tax on any transfer of a stock, bond, partnership interest or derivative. Stock trades would incur a 0.5% tax rate, or $5 for every $1,000 of stocks traded. Bond trading gets a 0.10% tax rate, derivatives a 0.005% tax rate.Although those tax rates seem small, in theory they could raise a lot of revenue for the government because of the size of U.S. financial markets. The total dollar value of U.S. stocks is around $25 trillion, and more than $300 billion in shares are traded on a typical day. The bond market is even bigger, with nearly $730 billion trading on an average day last year.The idea of taxing financial transactions didn't originate with Mr. Sanders. It is often called a ""Robin Hood Tax"" or a ""Tobin Tax,"" after Nobel laureate James Tobin, who proposed a tax on currency trading in the 1970s. Unlike Mr. Sanders's proposal, Mr.Tobin's tax wasn't primarily aimed at raising revenue. Rather, the point was to discourage speculation that Mr.Tobin said was destabilizing foreign-exchange markets.Similar taxes have been advocated by many prominent economists over the years, including John Maynard Keynes, Joseph Stiglitz and Lawrence Summers. At least 40 countries currently or previously have had financial-transaction taxes of one sort or another.The U.S. imposed a small tax on stock transactions beginning in 1914 to help raise funds to fight World War I. Initially, the tax was set at 0.02% but later ranged between 0.04% and 0.06% until its repeal in 1966. New York state and New York City jointly had a tax on stock trades until 1981. In fact, New York state still collects a stock-transfer tax -- and then refunds the money collected to the investors that paid it. So investors are, in effect, giving Albany an interest-free loan.The New York tax was the subject of a study by Bank of Canada economist Anna Pomeranets and Rutgers University economics professor Daniel Weaver. They found that the tax made stocks more volatile, depressed stock prices, widened bid-ask spreads and made capital more expensive for businesses. For example, when the tax was raised 25% in 1966, bid-ask spreads widened from 1.76% to 2.05%.The majority of the academic research into transaction taxes has reached similar findings: Taxes either have no effect on volatility or they increase volatility.Why would markets become more volatile when financial transactions are taxed? When an activity is taxed, people tend to do less of it. So trading volumes decline -- sometimes sharply. An International Monetary Fund study found that trading volume invariably fell when transaction taxes were imposed.According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a 0.01% tax would reduce volume by 24% in the first year, with volume falling even further in the future. Much of that reduction would likely come from discouraging high-frequency trading and ""unproductive"" speculation, according to the Tax Policy Center.What would a tax do to stock and bond prices? It is impossible to know for sure, of course. But because investors value liquidity, anything that makes buying or selling more costly tends to push prices down. When Sweden put in place a 1% tax on equity trades in 1983, the result was a 5.3% decline on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.According to the IMF study, the impact on prices would depend on the average holding period for a particular asset class. So stocks that trade frequently would likely decline the most. Less frequently traded securities, like corporate bonds, would be expected to hold up better.The economy, too, could suffer. When the European Commission looked at the issue, it found that a tax of 0.1% would reduce gross domestic product by 1.76% in the long run. That is mainly because the tax raises the cost of capital, resulting in less investment and diminished economic output.There are also questions about how much revenue the tax would raise. For starters, anything that makes stock prices drop sharply reduces how much the government collects in capital-gains taxes.When the Joint Committee on Taxation looked at an earlier proposal for a financial-transaction tax, it estimated that around $35 billion a year would be collected. The Tax Policy Center estimates the maximum that could be collected would be $50 billion a year.Credit: By John Carney",3/22/16
Democratic Presidential Contest Sparks Tensions on College Campuses; Pro-Sanders coalition versus smaller group backing Clinton remain deeply at odds at some colleges,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775257490?accountid=12768,"Morgan Johnson, a founder of ""Buckeyes for Bernie"" at Ohio State University, recently received an unwanted invitation from other college Democrats. The pitch to Bernie Sanders supporters: Come on over to Camp Clinton.""They are already trying to facilitate what they're calling a 'unity talk,'"" said Ms. Johnson, a 21-year-old junior. ""I can guarantee that the majority of our supporters--we're not yet interested.""Indeed, while Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has a considerable lead in the contest for delegates, Mr. Sanders's army of campus supporters is holding firm. The Vermont senator himself has said he is staying in the race through the Democratic National Convention in July.Meanwhile, the two contingents of young, primarily first-time voters--the larger pro-Sanders coalition versus the smaller pro-Clinton group--remain deeply at odds at some colleges.""I definitely feel very, very outnumbered,"" said Chloe Atwater, 20, a Clinton supporter who is vice president of the University of Kentucky College Democrats. Ms. Atwater, a junior, said she gets in frequent verbal showdowns with Sanders supporters. ""I feel like the culture has reached a fever pitch,"" she said.The tension is arising partly because while Mrs. Clinton is the front-runner nationally, Mr. Sanders consistently wins among the youngest voters. And Mr. Sanders's youth base could be valuable to the Democratic nominee, whoever that is, in November. By 2012, when President Barack Obama won his second term, 18- to 29-year-olds had grown to 19% of the turnout.Mrs. Clinton has won 57.7% of the vote overall, but only 29.1% of the vote among ages 17-29, according to new data from the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies, which aggregated all the exit polls where possible so far. The former Secretary of State leads among older voters.The numbers are striking given that Mr. Sanders, 74, barely registered among young Democrats in surveys measuring interest in potential presidential candidates last year, said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. ""This is a phenomenon,"" he said. ""There was no conversation a year ago between millennials and Sanders.""The Sanders campaign, Mr. Della Volpe said, tapped into several themes that millennials rank as important: integrity, authenticity and fresh ideas.Mr. Sanders's campus supporters also point to the senator's focus on economic inequality and campaign-finance reform, and to his proposal for free tuition at public colleges.""There is a millennial draw to that,"" said Bridget Silha, 19, a student at Michigan State University. But the statewide campus organizer for Sanders supporters said her own health issues and experience with out-of-pocket medical costs also led her to Mr. Sanders. She believes he would better tackle problems like high pharmaceutical prices.""He's not going to give up without a fight,"" she said.The Clinton campaign says it is trying to reach as many students as possible. It said it has more than 100 campus groups, deploys surrogates to engage millennial audiences, and aggressively reaches out on digital media.While campaigning, Mrs. Clinton has directly addressed young voters, telling them that even if they don't support her, she will support them.Mrs. Clinton's campus backers stress her experience and what they see as her more achievable goals, including her college-affordability plan.""I've always looked up to her,"" said Erica Borsack, 21, a Colgate University senior who is co-president of Colgate for Hillary and is particularly concerned about equal pay for women.While rivalries are friendly on some campuses, clashes are breaking out on others as the race goes on.Among Mr. Sander's campus supporters, one perception is that Clinton college supporters are ""just voting for her because they think she is going to win,"" said Elizabeth Lee, 21, a Middlebury College junior and the founder of College Students for Bernie, a national network of about 200 campus organizations.Clinton backers can find themselves on the defensive.""The people who Bernie finally woke up and made care about politics feel that they're entitled to go after you,"" said Kevin Sabo, 24, a Clinton supporter who is also the political director of California College Democrats.Mr. Sabo, a senior at the University of California, Berkeley, said he is concerned about Mr. Sanders's electability but also believes Mrs. Clinton would get more done once in office.He and his housemates, three Sanders supporters and two Clinton backers among them, argued into the morning recently over the race, he said. ""It got pretty intense even in my own house,"" he said.Ms. Lee, the founder of College Students for Bernie, said she believes that most Sanders supporters would eventually support Mrs. Clinton if she is the nominee.But they aren't ceding ground yet.""It's very much like we're still competing against each other,"" she said. ""It's not an unequal relationship where they extend their welcome and we'll take them up on it.""Dante Chinni contributed to this article.Write to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.comCredit: By Jennifer Levitz",3/23/16

"Voters Should Be Mad at Electric Cars; If Trump and Sanders fans hate absurd handouts to elites, the Tesla economy is the place to look.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772380844?accountid=12768,"How much subsidy is flowing to electric cars these days? An accidental experiment in California might open some eyes. California awards carpool-lane privileges to electric cars, but thanks to a legislative lapse ran out of the green stickers for plug-in hybrids. A local Ford dealer tells us that late-model hybrids with the sticker now fetch a $3,000 premium over the identical car without the sticker.By the way, this merely confirms an earlier finding by Audatex, a company that serves the auto-insurance industry, that stickers added as much as $1,500 to the value of used non-pluggable hybrids after eligibility was removed from those far more numerous cars.And $3,000 is a drop in the bucket. The grossest handout, obviously, is the federal tax credit for buyers of $7,500. Additional rebates are available in many states ($2,500 in California, $6,000 in Colorado), not to mention further handouts for installation of home chargers.Then toss in resalable ZEV credits, for zero-emissions vehicles, under rules in California and nine other states, whose value the Los Angeles Times in 2013 pegged at $35,000 per car in states that account for at least one-third of Tesla's U.S. sales.When averaged over Tesla's total U.S. sales, the combined subsidies amount to $20,000 per car, and in California upward of $45,000. And for what purpose? Electricity, in America, is largely produced from fossil fuels. If the electric system were somehow converted to renewables, then it wouldn't matter how we powered our cars, because passenger cars account for less than 8% of global greenhouse emissions.But then arguments have nothing to do with it. ""Up with electric cars"" is a slogan that you can pick the public's pocket with.This month Tesla will unveil its Model 3, its car for the middle class, retailing for $35,000--or considerably less than the value of its explicit and implicit subsidies in many states. And don't kid yourself that Elon Musk, Tesla's billionaire impresario, doesn't price his cars to make sure the full value of these handouts flows through the buyer's pocket to Tesla's top line.One sales prediction we can make with confidence. Tesla is expected to sell its 200,000th U.S. car sometime in 2018, and that sale will fall on or very near the first day of a calendar quarter. How do we know? Under current law, federal tax credits for a given manufacturer begin phasing out two calendar quarters after the quarter in which eligible output tops 200,000.And you wonder why, on some level, voters sense that our political class has led America into a dead-end where the only people doing well are the ones who have subsidies, regulation and political influence stacked in their favor.The Kauffman Foundation, in a recent study of waning American entrepreneurship, listed ""incumbent protection"" as a factor. So a pregnant but almost undiscussed question is whether the federal tax rebate will really be allowed to lapse, and whether Tesla's business model can survive it.Tesla's cars have status cachet, yes. Even middle-class customers might be attracted, notwithstanding low gas prices, as long as helped by an enormous dollop of taxpayer favoritism.But here's a problem: GM and other established car makers, under Obama fuel-mileage rules, increasingly also need to churn out electric cars in order to keep selling the pickups and SUVs that earn their profits. GM can't survive unless it makes and sells electric cars at a loss, whereas Tesla can't survive unless it sells them at a profit.A conclusion flows inescapably, especially if the direct tax rebates to buyers go away: The highest, best value of Tesla's brand can be realized only if Tesla sells itself to a pickup truck maker--or buys one.Of course this has occurred to Tesla--sort of. In a speech in Detroit last year, Tesla Vice President Diarmuid O'Connell proposed that conventional car makers farm out to Tesla the job of making electric ""compliance vehicles"" for them.Is this really what American capitalism has come to? Electric-car fans, of course, recognize their vulnerability to the public waking up to the absurdity of their subsidy regime. So do investors. Maybe that's why, after falling for five months, Tesla's stock price turned sharply up the day after the New Hampshire primary.The New Hampshire outcome, recall, showed Donald Trump dominating the GOP nomination race and suggested to many onlookers that the chances of a Democratic successor to President Obama had materially improved. Indeed, nothing else makes sense when you consider how thoroughly Tesla's business model depends on taxpayer largess.Credit: By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.",3/24/16
"Election 2016: Nevada Union's Silence Clouds Caucus --- Clinton, Sanders battle for support of culinary workers after group forgoes endorsement",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767301907?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS -- Eight years ago, Nevada's powerful Culinary Union mobilized to support its chosen candidate, Barack Obama, helping to boost turnout in the Democratic presidential caucuses and build credibility for what was still a long-shot campaign.This time around, casino workers and their family members are up for grabs.Leading into Saturday's Democratic caucus,the Culinary Union has withheld an endorsement, adding to the uncertainty around voter turnout and the outcome. It has also pushed the campaigns of Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to go to aggressive lengths to find and court the union workers who cook, wash dishes, waitress and clean rooms in this tourism mecca.Mr. Sanders came to the union offices last year even before he announced he was running for president, and he showed up this week at a protest outside a hospital, which Mrs. Clinton also attended. Earlier, his representatives went into employee dining halls at casinos and talked to workers while wearing union pins, a tactic the union said was inappropriate. Mr. Sanders' campaign chalked the issue up to a misunderstanding.Mrs. Clinton in November appeared at an organizing rally outside a hotel co-owned by Donald Trump to support a union-organizing campaign there. She has met union members at several casinos in the last week.""Both have shown a lot of support to come speak to us,"" said Nelson Lucero, a barista at the New York New York casino, who said he hadn't settled on a candidate. ""I think that's really important.""With 57,000 members, the culinary workers' union, which is overwhelmingly Hispanic and Democratic, dominates state politics to an extent nearly unmatched elsewhere.In past campaigns, the union made up much of the ground game for the candidates it supported. Part of its strength comes from being able to visit workers and talk to them about politics in the employee-only backhouses of casinos.That was a factor in the 2008 and 2012 presidential races, as well as in Democratic Sen. Harry Reid's tight re-election campaign in 2010. The union also played a role in ousting several Republican state legislators, according to state political experts.A variety of factors this year led the executive board of the Culinary Union's parent union, Unite Here, to vote in January not to endorse a candidate. The union has said that the primary factor in that decision was contract negotiations that are taking up time and resources.""We made the decision to focus on union business over political business,"" said Yvanna Cancela, the union's political director.One key issue, according to several people familiar with the matter, was a dispute with the Obama administration over some aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The union fought the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% excise-tax increase on high-cost health-care plans, including those covering Culinary Union members. Mr. Obama signed into law a two-year delay on the tax late last year, but he had refused the union's demands that the tax be removed altogether.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders both supported the removal, but union officials wanted more evidence they would work against it, people familiar with the matter said.The union learned that it ""should expect more from politicians than campaign promises,"" one person familiar with its thinking said.The AFL-CIO, the national union organization of which Unite Here is a part, also said this week that it wouldn't endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.For the Culinary Union, the nonendorsement allows it to avoid some of the awkward infighting that occurred eight years ago, when it endorsed Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton won the largest number of votes in the caucuses, but Mr. Obama won the most delegates.The union's decision not to endorse a candidate could have implications for state Democrats in the fall. Some close to the Culinary Union say that with the union sitting out recent elections, they sense enthusiasm for politics could be down.But Ms. Cancela said the union plans to heavily re-engage ahead of the general election to support the Democratic nominee.It has started preparing by launching an organizing drive to gain citizenship for its members, so that they will be able to vote, and to register 12,000 additional members to vote.Credit: By Alexandra Berzon and Peter Nicholas",3/24/16
Election 2016: Sanders and Clinton Vie for Rural Nevadans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766612386?accountid=12768,"ELKO, Nev. -- Hours away from the glam and glitter of Las Vegas, a fierce contest between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is playing out in the mountains and deserts of Nevada.State caucus rules give rural counties outsize weight in the delegate-allocation process, a directive aimed at ensuring candidates don't just campaign in the cities.Consequently, the road to victory in Saturday's Democratic caucuses runs through places like Elko, a small mountain mining community that is the closest thing to a major city in northeast Nevada, and Pahrump, a desert town of about 36,000 that boasts a handful of casinos, a couple of brothels -- and Clinton and Sanders campaign field offices.And both campaigns are working these sparsely populated communities, phoning supporters daily and driving to remote houses on dirt roads to knock on doors and see if the people who answer might need a lift to caucus sites.Mr. Sanders brought his pitch to Elkoon Friday, a picturesque mountain town of 20,000 people that lies more than 300 miles north of Las Vegas in a conservative part of the state. He was following Mrs. Clinton, who flew in earlier in the week. Republican candidates, who hold their caucusesTuesday, were expected to start arriving in northern Nevada over the next few days.""Tomorrow, the eyes of America and the eyes of much of the world are going to focus on Nevada,"" Mr. Sanders said at a rally. ""And the issue is not just who wins the Democratic nomination. The issue is whether Nevada will play a leading role in moving this country toward a political revolution which transforms this country -- whether the people of Nevada will say enough is enough.""With polls showing the race as a dead heat, Mr. Sanders spent the day before the caucuses stumping in Elko and Reno before returning to Las Vegas for a large rally. Mrs. Clinton made stops in both Reno and Elko earlier in the week.Though the overwhelming majority of the state's people live in and around Las Vegas, campaigns ignore the rural areas at their own peril. In the 2008 Democratic race between Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama, she won the state but Mr. Obama collected more delegates in part because of a stronger organization and presence in the rural areas.""She won the popular vote, but she did not win the caucus because caucuses are based on delegates,"" said Joan Kato, a former aide to Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign who now serves as the state director for Mr. Sanders. Nevada has 23 delegates up for grabs in this year's caucuses.That was a mistake her campaign didn't plan to repeat. She has offices in Elko, Pahrump, and Carson City, and organizers across the state. Mr. Sanders has 12 field offices, though his campaign started organizing in Nevada months after Mrs. Clinton arrived.The Clinton campaign says its staffers logged 1,250 miles across rural Nevada last summer, sending senior campaign leaders into communities for a listening tour that helped shape the campaign's rural strategy.Former President Bill Clinton also visited Pahrump this month and spoke to a few hundred people at an elementary school.Gabe Alvare, a 24-year-old Clinton volunteer visiting from New York City, spent hours knocking on doors of known supporters on Wednesday in Pahrump, making sure they planned to show up for the caucus. Another Clinton volunteer, Frank Dix, 73, lives in Pahrump and feels a special loyalty to the Clinton family. ""I'm partial to strong women,"" Mr. Dix said.There is no surefire way to get people to turn up at the caucus sites. One person mentioned that softball practice posed a potential conflict. A woman said her husband was planning to go, but he hasn't been feeling good lately.At a spartan office nearby, the Sanders campaign was also working to get out the vote. Volunteers were making calls and planning a mock caucus session so attendees would know what to expecton Saturday.Rick Bandell, a 75-year-old retiree, said he was thrilled to call one home and persuade an entire family to show up in support of Mr. Sanders.

With 38% of the vote in, the Vermont senator was leading Mrs. Clinton by 78.7% to 21.3%.With just 16 pledged delegates at stake, Alaska offered the smallest prize on a day when Washington and Hawaii also held Democratic caucuses.Still, neither candidate wrote off the state. Mrs. Clinton called into a radio station in the run-up to the caucuses and talked about a time after graduating from college when she briefly worked at a fish cannery in Alaska.""And think about this,"" she reportedly told the station, ""I'm the only candidate who's ever actually worked in Alaska. So, hooray!""Mr. Sanders opened a handful of offices in the state, hoping to string together enough victories that might give superdelegates a reason to rethink their allegiance to Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders has a steep uphill battle to gain enough delegates to become the nominee. As he lost ground to Mrs. Clinton in earlier contests, the Sanders campaign asked voters for patience. His advisers have argued that the second half of the primary season, which started this week, would take the race to more favorable terrain--namely, Western states that are more amenable to Mr. Sanders's candidacy and message, his advisers have said.While Mr. Sanders's victories in Idaho and Utah on March 22 showed strength in Western states with small Hispanic or African-American populations, Mrs. Clinton has tended to dominate in states with large minority populations.Hawaii's population is more than one-third Asian-American, along with sizable white and native Hawaiian populations. Alaska is almost 15% Native American. And in Washington state, Yakima and Grant counties have large Hispanic populations of 40% or more.Under Democratic rules, delegates are awarded proportionally based on results, not winner take all, so Mr. Sanders not only needs to win the states, but win by large margins, to close the delegate gap with Mrs. Clinton.Meanwhile, a new skirmish over the Democratic debate schedule was brewing, with the two camps unable to reach agreement on dates and locations for the final matchups. Both campaigns consented to face off two more times--once in April and again in May. But several weeks after that pledge was made, the Democratic National Committee still describes all the details of the ninth and 10th debates as ""to be determined.""Party officials say they are waiting for the Clinton and Sanders teams to decide timing and locations. Clinton campaign officials say they are waiting to hear from the DNC. And Sanders aides say they just want to make sure the debates happen.Team Sanders wants to hold the next debate in New York, a delegate-rich state that will hold its primary on April 19.

"For Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, a Debate Over More Debates Brews; Democratic presidential candidates unable to reach agreement over final matchups; 'to be determined'",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775731985?accountid=12768,"A new skirmish over debates is brewing between the Democratic presidential campaigns, with the two camps unable to reach agreement so far on dates and locations for the final matchups between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.The former secretary of state and the Vermont senator consented to face off two more times--once in April and again in May.

Clinton campaign officials say they are waiting to hear from the DNC. And Sanders aides say they just want to make sure the debates happen.The debate schedule has been a continuing point of contention in the Democratic Party. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz came under fire for originally scheduling just six Democratic debates, a decision that many Sanders backers said favored the former secretary of state and limited the Vermont senator's national exposure. In February, the Clinton and Sanders campaigns agreed to four additional debates, one in New Hampshire, another in Flint, Mich., and two more to be named later. Those final two are the ones in limbo now.Read More on Capital Journal* Cruz Gets More Delegates in State He Lost* How Trump's Hard Line on Trade Could Backfire* Democratic Presidential Contest Sparks Tensions on College CampusesAfter eight Democratic debates and numerous other joint town-hall events, it's unclear how much impact another matchup might have on the race. And GOP front-runner Donald Trump recently brought the Republican debates to an abrupt halt, saying, ""I think we've had enough.""Public discussion of the last two Democratic debates has been scant. But talks have continued behind the scenes, said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager. California has emerged as the leading option for a May debate, he said, but the two campaigns disagree on an April destination.Team Sanders wants to hold the next debate in New York, a delegate-rich state that will hold its primary on April 19. The Clinton camp has declined, Mr. Weaver said, and has advocated for a debate in Pennsylvania, where primary voters will go to the polls on April 26.Mr. Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, and his campaign has targeted New York as a high-priority primary state where the Vermont senator plans to campaign aggressively. But Mr. Weaver said Mrs. Clinton should be amenable to debating there, noting that she served as a U.S. senator from New York and located her 2016 campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. ""I just don't know what the Clinton campaign is afraid of,"" he said.Clinton aides declined to comment on the negotiations or the prospects of proceeding with two more debates. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, demurred recently on the question of whether the former secretary of state would continue to debate her Democratic rival. ""We're waiting to hear from the DNC,"" he told MSNBC. ""But there's a lot of states coming up and a lot of campaigning to do. We're focused on talking with the voters in those states.""A DNC official said that the two campaigns haven't agreed on the dates and places for the next debates.Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and a Clinton backer, initially pushed for additional debates but now says there's no reason to schedule the last two matchups. ""Both sides have had the chance to make their case between the debates and the town halls,"" he said. ""There's nothing to be gained by having these two slug it out any more.""Mr. Sanders is trying to overcome a daunting delegate deficit in the race and likely has more to gain from sharing a stage with his rival as he tries to dent her lead.Simon Rosenberg, president and founder of NDN, formerly known as the New Democrat Network, said the debates are an important opportunity for the Democratic Party to reach key voter groups and ultimately increase turnout. Republicans have held more debates and have drawn significantly more viewers, he said.What's more, the DNC told Democratic voters there would be more debates, said Mr. Rosenberg, who supports Mrs. Clinton. ""These voters deciding now in the later states deserve a debate,"" he said. ""Not every question has been asked and answered, and new issues come up.""Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",3/28/16
Democrats Weak on Social Security Reform; None of the Social Security reform proposals put forward by Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is new.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775731920?accountid=12768,"Regarding Andrew G. Biggs's ""Hillary's and Bernie's Pie-in-the-Sky Social Security Proposals "" (op-ed, March 18): None of the Social Security reform proposals put forward by Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is new. All their proposals mirror features of European state pension plans, all of which face financing problems due in part to their rich benefits but mainly as a result of a lack of economic growth and demographic decline.A serious policy to stabilize Social Security would gradually raise the retirement age to 69. The ceiling below which earnings are liable to the OASDI tax would be raised so that it covers 90% of earnings. If those two measures prove inadequate, tax should be increased modestly.We should scrap the 75-year financial-planning window. No one knows how the economy will perform up to 2091 or how it will perform over the next five years. We should separate the finances of the retirement plan from the disability plan. We should stop cross-subsidizing the disability plan using funds from the retirement plan's reserve. We should take steps to stabilize the finances of the disability plan, primarily by limiting access to it so that it cannot be used as a de facto retirement program.The government should implement policies that will promote economic growth by reducing both corporate and personal income-tax rates, allowing multinational companies to repatriate profits earned overseas without taxing them, reducing the burden of regulation, promoting immigration and reversing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The single most important short-term obstacle to solving Social Security's financial problems is the federal government.Prof. Alfred C.

Bernie Sanders Now Needs Landslides to Gain Ground on Hillary Clinton; Coming Democratic primaries and caucuses look daunting for the Vermont senator,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775217316?accountid=12768,"The trio of elections Tuesday demonstrated just how difficult it is for Bernie Sanders to wrest the Democratic nomination from front-runner Hillary Clinton.Looked at in isolation, Mr. Sanders had a good night. He won two states; she carried one . But in the end, Mr. Sanders came away with 18 more pledged delegates on the night than his rival, according to an updated Associated Press tally.That isn't enough to significantly dent Mrs. Clinton's lead and reach a goal the Sanders campaign has set for itself: persuading superdelegates that he is surging and they should abandon Mrs. Clinton.As he lost ground to Mrs. Clinton in earlier contests, the Sanders campaign asked voters for patience. His advisers have argued that the second half of the primary season, which started this week, would take the race to more favorable terrain. The race is now moving to Western states that are more amenable to Mr. Sanders's candidacy and message, his advisers have said.Tuesday's contests in Arizona, Utah and Idaho were the first test of that proposition. He lost the Arizona primary, the biggest delegate prize of the night, by 18 points. Mr. Sanders won the caucuses in Utah and Idaho by 60 and 57 points, respectively.But he will have to win far more consistently if he is to erase Mrs. Clinton's lead of more than 300 pledged delegates.Under Democratic rules, delegates are awarded proportionally based on results, not winner take all. So, Mrs. Clinton was able to preserve a comfortable lead Tuesday even though she won only one of the three states up for grabs.Mrs. Clinton celebrated her Arizona victory at a rally in Seattle, where she was campaigning ahead of Saturday's Washington state caucuses. She looked past Mr. Sanders entirely and sharply criticized Republicans, particularly presidential front-runner Donald Trump. She said voters understand that the contest under way isn't just a choice between candidates.""This is a contest between fundamentally different views of our country, our values and our future,"" she said. As for Mr. Sanders, he continued to project confidence late Tuesday night, saying that his bid for the White House is generating energy and excitement.In a speech, he urged voters to consider how far he has come since he launched his campaign nearly a year ago and was immediately dismissed as a ""fringe"" candidate.Mrs. Clinton built her delegate lead through easy victories in the South and then capturing each of the five large states that held primaries last week. A look at the calendar reveals limited opportunities for the Vermont senator to close the gap.Mr. Sanders could score several victories in Western states and beyond. But because delegates are awarded proportionately, narrowing Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead will require him to notch landslides--not merely wins--to garner big shares of available delegates.An examination of the 25 contests stretching from now until mid-June shows opportunities for Mrs. Clinton to hold her lead or even build on it. As a presidential candidate in 2008, she faced then-Sen. Barack Obama in each of those states. She won 11 contests; Mr. Obama won 14.Related* Ted Cruz's Utah Win Doesn't Derail Donald Trump's Delegate Momentum* Ted Cruz Channels 'American President' in Defending Wife* Donald Trump Threatens to 'Spill the Beans' on Rival's Wife* Arizona's Independents are the Silent Plurality* In Focus Group, Trump Supporters Worry About GOP Betrayal* Wisconsin Primary to Test Ted Cruz, Bernie Sanders* Brussels Attacks Will Jolt 2016 U.S. Presidential RaceBut her 11 victories came in states and one territory, Puerto Rico, that in the 2016 primaries account for a whopping 1,342 delegates. By contrast, the 14 contests she lost in her last campaign offer only 547 delegates this year.To assess how the next phase of the race suits Mrs. Clinton, consider California. The state's June primary will allocate the biggest prize of the entire race, 475 delegates. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton won California easily, defeating Mr. Obama by eight points.David Wasserman, a delegate analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, wrote recently that Mr. Sanders could string together several victories in the West and then stall in the more diverse Northeastern states.""If there is bad news for Clinton, it's that the next month of primaries could give the false impression that Sanders is on track for a big comeback,"" Mr. Wasserman wrote.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has described the former secretary of state's delegate lead as ""nearly insurmountable.""Corrections & Amplifications: Bernie Sanders won 18 more pledged delegates in Tuesday's elections than his rival Hillary Clinton, according to an updated preliminary Associated Press tally.

Bernie Sanders Lags Hillary Clinton Despite Winning Two State Caucuses; Clinton won Arizona; Sanders took Utah and Idaho in Tuesday contests,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775013222?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders battled to a split decision in Tuesday's Democratic contests, but the former secretary of state maintained her commanding lead in the chase for delegates by winning the primary in Arizona , the day's biggest prize.Mr. Sanders notched victories in both the Utah and Idaho caucuses, claiming his first states since he scored an upset in Michigan two weeks ago.Tuesday's results still left Mr. Sanders behind his Democratic rival in the delegate count, as Arizona offered more delegates than Idaho and Utah combined.Mrs. Clinton celebrated her victory at a rally in Seattle, where she was campaigning ahead of Saturday's Washington state caucuses. She looked past Mr. Sanders entirely and sharply criticized Republicans, particularly front-runner Donald Trump, who won the GOP primary in Arizona , and said voters understand that the race under way isn't just a choice between candidates.""This is a contest between fundamentally different views of our country, our values and our future,"" she said.With the primary season half over, Mr. Sanders entered Tuesday's three nominating contests in urgent need of lopsided wins and a strategy for broadening his coalition beyond the young and largely white group of voters who have boosted him so far. He had devoted significant time and resources to Arizona , holding events there almost every day during the last week, traveling to the Mexican border and investing in television ads.Mrs. Clinton was helped by Arizona rules that limited participation in the primary to Democratic Party members, excluding independent voters, who have tended to back Mr. Sanders. The state's large share of older voters, who strongly backed Mrs. Clinton in prior primaries, also made the state friendly territory for her. The state awards 75 delegates on a proportional basis.Mr. Sanders continued to project confidence late Tuesday night, saying that his bid for the White House is generating energy and excitement.""When we began this campaign, we were considered a fringe candidacy,"" the Vermont senator said in a speech after Mrs. Clinton was projected by the Associated Press to win Arizona. ""Well, 10 months later, we have now won 10 primaries and caucuses and, unless I'm very mistaken, we're going to win a couple more tonight.""""When we began this campaign, we talked about the need for millions of people to become involved in the political process. Tonight, in Utah, tonight in Idaho, tonight in Arizona, there are record-breaking turnouts,"" Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders's campaign has argued that the second half of the primary season, starting with Tuesday's contests and heavy on Western states, would take the race to more favorable terrain. He not only needs to win states but to carry them by large margins in order to maximize his share of delegates.But Mr. Sanders had limped into this leg of the race.Mrs. Clinton had swept through the South, then won all five states that held primaries last week. While Mr. Sanders has predicted that he would prevail in the second half of the Democratic primary fight, a look at the calendar reveals limited opportunities for the Vermont senator to eat into Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead.Mr. Sanders could score several victories in Western states and beyond. But narrowing Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead will require him to notch landslides that produce big shares of available delegates.An examination of the 28 contests stretching from now until mid-June shows opportunities for Mrs. Clinton to hold her lead or even build on it. As a presidential candidate in 2008, she faced off against then-Sen. Barack Obama in each of those states. She won 12 contests; Mr. Obama won 16.But her 12 victories came in states and one territory, Puerto Rico, that in the 2016 primaries account for more than 1,400 delegates. By contrast, the 16 contests she lost in her last campaign offer only about 600 delegates this year.How Mrs. Clinton fared in 2008 is instructive, because she is holding the vast majority of states she won last time around. She carried states such as Ohio, Texas, Tennessee, Massachusetts and Arkansas both in 2008 and this year.To assess how the next phase of the race suits Mrs. Clinton, consider California. The state's June primary will allocate the biggest prize of the entire race, 475 delegates. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton won California easily, defeating Mr. Obama by eight points.Exit polls from that contest show an electorate that would seem amenable to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 candidacy, with African-American and Hispanic voters accounting for 37% of the electorate. Mrs. Clinton has shown she performs best in states with large minority voting blocs.Mr. Sanders's campaign has remained focused on every opportunity to make up ground. On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, touted the campaign's win in the primary among Democrats Abroad--a contest that netted the Vermont senator five more delegates than Mrs. Clinton.""This is the result we needed,"" Mr. Weaver wrote in a fundraising email. ""Now the map shifts in our favor, and we're going to begin clawing back delegates in state after state until we capture the lead on June 7th,"" the last major day of primary voting.Stan Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, said the race increasingly appears to be settled, making it difficult for Mr. Sanders to change the basic dynamic. The Vermont senator's failure to win any contest last week could prove to be a defining moment in this campaign, Mr. Greenberg said.""He lost momentum at that point, and we entered the endgame,"" he said.

"Wisconsin Primary to Test Ted Cruz, Bernie Sanders; If the No. 2 contenders can't win there, they face a diminishing belief they can win in states that follow",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774989423?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin's primary, up next on the presidential nominating calendar, presents a key test for the second-place Democratic and Republican candidates: If Sens. Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz can't win there, they face a diminishing belief that they can win in states that follow.That is because both Mr. Cruz, who is chasing GOP front-runner Donald Trump, and Mr. Sanders, who lags behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic delegate count, hold distinct advantages in Wisconsin.With two weeks between Tuesday's contests in Arizona and Utah and Wisconsin's vote on April 5, the candidates will be able to put down roots in a way they haven't since before the February contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.Related* Five Things to Watch in Tuesday's Election Contests* Donald Trump Looks to Pad Delegate Lead in Arizona, Utah* Sanders Seeks to Dent Clinton's Delegate LeadAmong the GOP, the action has already started. Mr. Cruz is scheduled to appear at a forum Wednesday in Waukesha County, a suburban Milwaukee area that is home to the state's largest concentration of GOP voters and crucial to any Republican's electoral hopes. He also announced four additional stops Thursday and Friday in Madison and the Fox Valley, the GOP-rich area between Milwaukee and Green Bay.To stress the importance of Wisconsin, the Cruz campaign put out a call for volunteers to come to the state to establish a ""Camp Cruz,"" which it hadn't done since South Carolina's Feb. 20 primary.""Cruz has an opportunity, but he also has a lot of work to do because most Wisconsinites don't know a lot about him,"" said Mark Graul, a veteran Republican operative from Green Bay who organized the state for George W. Bush in 2004. ""He's got the opportunity to come in and really show people why he is the best choice not just to be the anti-Trump but to be the next president.""The state will award 42 Republican delegates and 86 pledged to the Democrats. The GOP delegates will be allocated in two pools, one on a winner-take-all basis by congressional district and the other statewide. The Democratic delegates, also in two pools, will be awarded proportionally by congressional district and statewide.For Mr. Trump, Wisconsin's population distribution poses a particular disadvantage. He is highly unpopular in the Milwaukee area, where local conservative talk-radio hosts have been lamenting his rise for months.An analysis by Marquette Law School of its recent poll, published Saturday in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , found Mr. Trump is viewed positively by just 25% and negatively by 64% of GOP voters in the three suburban counties that ring Milwaukee. But in nearly three dozen rural counties in the state's west and north, the picture is reversed: Mr. Trump's favorable ratings are 21 percentage points higher than his negative ones.""In southeast Wisconsin, the local conservative talk-radio hosts have not followed the lead of the national guys,"" said Charlie Sykes, who regularly criticizes Mr. Trump on his morning radio show in Milwaukee and is hosting Mr. Cruz at the Wednesday forum in Waukesha. ""Trump has not had the talk-radio air cover here that he's had elsewhere.""Mr. Trump's Wisconsin footprint is light, and no significant elected official in the state backs his campaign. Mr. Trump's aides didn't respond to a request for his Wisconsin endorsements.But the New Yorker in recent weeks suggested putting a Wisconsinite on the Supreme Court: Judge Diane Sykes of the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The George W. Bush appointee used to be married to Mr. Sykes, the radio host.Almost the entire state GOP backed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's presidential bid, which he terminated in September amid low poll numbers and significant campaign debt. Mr. Walker hasn't endorsed a candidate since, and declined an interview request.Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the third-ranked GOP candidate, held a town hall meeting Tuesday in Wauwatosa. Mr. Kasich's top aide in the state, Brian Nemoir, said Wisconsin can be the place where the Ohio governor takes advantage of the race's three-way dynamic.""John Kasich is betting that at some point voters in the remaining 20 states and at the convention will get serious about beating Hillary Clinton in November,"" Mr. Nemoir said.For the Democrats, the latest polling shows an even race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator is extremely popular among liberals in and around Madison, where he held his first major rally, drawing 20,000 people in July. Wisconsin's demographics also tend to mirror those in neighboring Michigan and Minnesota, both of which Mr. Sanders won.Also helping Mr. Sanders is Wisconsin's history of backing liberal mavericks, going back to Sen. ""Fighting"" Bob La Follette, who founded the progressive movement a century ago.""Time and time again in Democratic primaries we go for the person who is much more out there on the progressive end of it,"" said Thad Nation, who was an aide to the state's last Democratic governor, Jim Doyle. ""It's a state that has a long history of progressive activism.""Mrs. Clinton has her own strength in Milwaukee, home to the vast majority of the state's blacks and Hispanics. Wisconsin Democrats said they expect higher voter turnout in Milwaukee than elsewhere because voters there also have hotly contested elections for mayor and county executive.And while Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have focused their ire of late on Mr. Trump, in Wisconsin they both figure to take aim at Mr. Walker, who remains a highly polarizing figure despised by activist Democrats.""Just mentioning Scott Walker will light a room on fire,"" said Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, who hasn't endorsed a candidate. ""For the base, that's filet mignon wrapped in bacon. It's really good red meat.""Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Write to Reid J.

"Hillary Clinton Wins Four States, Adding to Delegate Lead; Bernie Sanders looks for victory in the remaining state, Missouri, which remains too close to call",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773306860?accountid=12768,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton won critical presidential primaries in the industrial Midwest and completed her sweep of the South on Tuesday, as she took full command of a contest that has been far more competitive than expected at the start.Rival Bernie Sanders was still hoping to win in Missouri, where the result was too close to call. But even a Missouri win for Mr. Sanders seemed nowhere near enough to change the dynamic of the race. Mrs. Clinton won in Ohio, Illinois, Florida and North Carolina , and blunted Mr. Sanders's momentum from a win last week in Michigan. She widened her already formidable delegate lead and made it improbable he can catch up.""We are moving close to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November,"" the former secretary of state and New York senator told cheering supporters in Florida, boasting that she has won more votes than any candidate in either party.She took a swipe at Mr. Sanders, saying he should be more specific about his plans, but she lodged a wholesale indictment of Republican front-runner Donald Trump. ""When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture--that doesn't make him strong. It makes him wrong,"" she said.With 214 pledged delegates at stake, Florida was the night's biggest prize, while Illinois had 156 pledged delegates and Ohio 143 up for grabs. They will be awarded proportionally.Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders was ramping up his attacks on Mrs. Clinton, and has vowed to fight all the way to the summer convention. But he may now face increasing pressure to back off and revert to his earlier role as a candidate primarily driving a progressive, populist message rather than pursuing a viable path to the nomination.At his election night rally in Arizona Tuesday night, though, Mr. Sanders showed no signs of backing off. He pointed to Wall Street contributions to the super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton and repeated his call that she release transcripts of her high-priced speeches to Wall Street firms.""To my mind, if you're going to give a speech for $225,000 it must be a really great speech,"" he said. ""And if it's such a great speech, all of America should be able to read it.""In a statement issued late into the night, Mr. Sanders said the race was still winnable.""With more than half the delegates yet to be chosen and a calendar that favors us in the weeks and months to come, we remain confident that our campaign is on a path to win the nomination,"" he said.With nearly all precincts counted, Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Sanders 64.5% to 33.3% in Florida, by 54.6% to 40.8% in North Carolina and by 56.5% to 42.8% in Ohio.In Illinois, her margin was much closer, some 50.3% to 48.9% with 98% of precincts reporting.Mrs. Clinton had been expected to easily win Florida, with the state's demographics and rules barring independents from participating helping her. But Ohio was closely fought, and Mr. Sanders had hoped to parlay a victory last week in Michigan to the neighboring state. Both have seen a drain in manufacturing jobs, and Mr. Sanders put the blame squarely on free-trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton has long supported.Mrs. Clinton completed a sweep of the South, where strong support from African-Americans pumped up her totals. But her Ohio win was more important, showing she could win in the industrial Midwest.After Tuesday's vote, Mrs. Clinton was assured of adding at least 253 delegates to her column, bringing her total pledged delegates, who are chosen by the voters, to more than 1,000. Mr. Sanders was sure to add at least 124 delegates, but he was on track to end the night more than 300 delegates behind. Including superdelegates, who can vote for any candidate they like, her total topped 1,400, more than double his.At roughly the halfway point of the race, Sanders advisers say they now have the advantage, with friendlier states set later in the calendar. His campaign now looks ahead to contests next week in Arizona, Utah and Idaho, three states where aides have hoped to do well. But the next big delegate hauls aren't awarded until April: first in Wisconsin, and then the giant prize of New York, where Mrs. Clinton lives and which she represented in the Senate for eight years.In Florida, Mrs. Clinton's advantage was on display Tuesday in Miami, home to large populations of Hispanic and African-American voters who have gravitated to her campaign.""I like that she's a smart, charismatic woman,"" said Bridgette Thornton, a 37-year-old African-American attorney, who cast her ballot at a Miami church. ""It was a difficult choice for me, but I'm a practical person. Hillary has a better shot at winning the presidential election.""The race was closer in Ohio, where Mr. Sanders hammered his anti-free-trade views in recent days. Mrs. Clinton tried to recast her trade message, but the attempt fell flat with at least some voters.""The Clinton history with trade policies, that really just killed our area,"" said Fred Woke, a 57-year-old radio announcer who voted for Mr. Sanders in Niles, in northeastern Ohio.The question now is what tone Mr. Sanders will adopt in coming days. In the leadup to Tuesday's contests, the Vermont senator targeted Mrs. Clinton's record of support for free-trade deals, and for the backing she receives from an outside super PAC.Earlier in the race, Mr. Sanders vowed to avoid negative attacks, but he has amped up his critique in the weeks since voting began. On the stump leading into Tuesday's voting, he suggested Mrs. Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and connected her support for free-trade agreements to an exodus of manufacturing jobs across the Midwest.The challenge for both Democrats is that Mr. Trump, should he win the Republican nomination, would be an unconventional opponent who could pick up some of Mr. Sanders's populist arguments.That has some Clinton backers anxious for Mr. Sanders to ease up. ""The message of Sanders campaign has become personal attacks,"" said Robert Zimmerman, a superdelegate from New York who backs Mrs. Clinton. ""It's not only wrong, it's dangerous politically if he keeps up that tone. It could hurt plans for party unity and empower Republicans.""Steve Elmendorf, a political consultant who backs Mrs. Clinton, agreed there will come a point when Mr. Sanders needs to let up, but he said it isn't for Clinton supporters to say when. ""When it becomes clear you cannot win, then you should unite behind the nominee of the party and try to beat the Republicans,"" Mr. Elmendorf said. ""It's for him to decide when he can't win.""In 2008, Mrs. Clinton herself continued to compete in presidential-primary contests against then-Sen. Barack Obama even though he remained ahead in the delegate race the entire time.""Even if he doesn't think he will win the nomination, he's trying to amass as many delegates as he can,"" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. Delegates would give Mr. Sanders leverage at the party's convention and demonstrate the strength of his movement, Mr. Trippi said, adding, ""I don't see him relenting.""Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 News.* Live Coverage: Tuesday's Primaries* Exit Polls Show Sharpening Partisan Divide Among Primary Voters* Donald Trump Takes Florida, John Kasich Wins Ohio* Marco Rubio Suspends GOP Campaign for President* One-on-One Fight With Trump Eludes Cruz* In Illinois, Clinton and Sanders Vie for Obama Legacy* More GOP Suits Seek Records From Clinton's Term at State Department* Obama Warns 2016 Campaign Marring U.S. ReputationSanders aides see a narrow path to the nomination to the nomination and say the senator will continue to fight for it.

""You want to get Democrats over the Sanders-Clinton thing, give them five seconds to think about Trump being within five feet of the nuclear codes,"" Mr. Schale said.He said he saw no mathematical way for Mr. Sanders to overcome Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead, and said a protracted primary fight would occupy time that the Clinton campaign could be using to prepare for the general election.""If Hillary Clinton has to go debate Bernie Sanders in New York, and compete in Indiana and California, that means the campaign is not spending time thinking about building organizations in Ohio and Colorado and Florida,"" he said.President Barack Obama has suggested that he, too, could bring the Democratic Party together once the primary battle concludes. Mr. Obama previously had raised the prospect of making an endorsement in the Democratic primary, but he has since backed off that idea, saying last week that Democratic voters are doing a fine job.""It's been a good conversation,"" Mr. Obama said.

"Bernie Sanders Gets No Respect; He runs away with three more states, but Democratic elites stick with Hillary Clinton.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775994834?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders won three Western Democratic caucuses by landslides on Saturday, and all he got was this lousy Associated Press headline: ""Sanders wins 3 states; Clinton holds delegate lead."" The AP header is accurate, but the Vermont Senator and his legions can be forgiven for wondering what he has to do to get some political respect.Mr. Sanders won Alaska with about 82% of the vote, Hawaii with 70% and delegate-rich Washington state with 73%. These may not be bellwether states. But Donald Trump or Ted Cruz would love to have those margins, and in a normal year a front-runner like Hillary Clinton would be running up such totals at this stage of the presidential race. Instead the 74-year-old Mr. Sanders is showing the kind of electoral strength that gives him every right to fight on at least through April's contests and maybe to the convention in July.The challenger's victories reveal Mrs. Clinton's continuing weakness even among Democratic partisans. On Tuesday Mr. Sanders won in Utah and Idaho, while the former Secretary of State won easily in Arizona. She continues to have a delegate lead thanks to her victories in states dominated by older African-American voters and government-employee unions. But she inspires little enthusiasm, and the case for her seems to boil down to her inevitability as the nominee and that her political experience and stolidity are antidotes to the likely GOP nominee, Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders is also fighting the perception that as an avowed socialist he can't win in November. ""Don't let anybody tell you that Hillary Clinton is the strongest Democratic candidate to take on the Republicans,"" Mr. Sanders told an estimated crowd of 15,000 in the People's Republic of Seattle. ""It is not true.""The current head-to-head polls bear him out. In the Real Clear Politics polling average, Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump by 17.5 points and Mr. Cruz by 8.4. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump by 11.2 and Mr. Cruz by only 2.9. Mr. Sanders is tied with John Kasich, while Mrs. Clinton loses to the Ohio Governor by 6.5 points.Most Americans still don't know much about what Mr. Sanders believes, including his desire to return to 1930s tax rates and his sympathy for Communist regimes during the Cold War. His belief in undiluted socialism would be vetted in a general election campaign in a way it hasn't been in the Democratic primaries.Then again, Mrs. Clinton has helped to validate many of those positions by moving so far left herself. And in Mr. Trump the Republicans may nominate a candidate who is building negative approval ratings that no candidate has been able to recover from and win the White House.Mrs. Clinton remains the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, not least because of her lead in ""superdelegates."" These are current or former elected officials and other Democratic grandees who are formally unpledged to any candidate before the convention. AP currently has them going 469 for Mrs. Clinton and only 29 for Mr. Sanders.For all the talk about an open convention that could deny Mr. Trump the GOP nomination, the Democratic establishment has done far more to rig the nominating process to favor elites. One reason Mr. Sanders gets no respect is because Democratic elites prefer a nominee who disguises her socialism better than he does.",3/29/16
"Bernie Sanders Gets Boost From Saturday Sweep but Trails in Delegate Count; Sanders beats Clinton by significant margins in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington Democratic caucuses",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775937204?accountid=12768,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's resounding victories in three weekend caucuses gave his campaign a much-needed boost but did little to slow Hillary Clinton's march to the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.His wins in the Washington, Alaska and Hawaii caucuses, coupled with his strong fundraising, strengthen Mr. Sanders's argument for remaining in the Democratic race.But his path to the nomination remains contingent on big victories in the roughly two dozen states and territories that have yet to vote--and on persuading roughly 500 party officials and activists known as superdelegates to abandon Mrs. Clinton and back him at the July convention in Philadelphia.""We think we do have a path toward victory,"" Mr. Sanders said Sunday on CNN. ""We've won the last five out of six contests, all of them in landslide victories. What we have said from day one is the South is the most conservative part of America. We did not do well there...We're out of the South, we're heading to the West Coast which is the most progressive part of America. We think we're going to do very well there.""The Sanders campaign acknowledges that it is fighting an uphill battle, but Mr. Sanders cited his momentum in arguing that ""a lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position.""The campaign moves on to Wisconsin next. Mrs. Clinton announced Saturday she would campaign in Madison, Milwaukee, La Crosse and Green Bay in advance of that state's April 5 primary. Mr. Sanders has campaign stops scheduled in Appleton, Milwaukee, Kenosha and La Crosse this week.After Wisconsin, the next big contest is in late April in New York, a delegate-rich state that carries symbolic meaning for both campaigns. Mrs. Clinton represented the state in the Senate between 2001 and 2009 and has based her campaign there. Mr. Sanders was born in Brooklyn and makes frequent references to his childhood upbringing.In Alaska, Mr. Sanders beat Mrs. Clinton by 64 percentage points, in Washington by 46 points, and in Hawaii by 40.Mrs. Clinton didn't campaign heavily in the three states, expecting that Mr. Sanders would win. In the run-up to the contest in Alaska, she called into a radio station and recalled a period after college when she briefly worked at a fish cannery in the state.Related* Bernie Sanders Wins Hawaii, Washington, Alaska CaucusesMrs. Clinton has built her delegate lead on nonwhite and older voters, winning in states across the South where black voters make up a significant proportion of the electorate. Though Mr. Sanders trails in delegates the map is potentially friendlier for him in April and May when a number of northeastern states head to the polls.Mr. Sanders won at least 55 of the delegates at stake on Saturday, while Mrs. Clinton won at least 20. That means he still trails Mrs. Clinton 1,004 delegates to 1,712 delegates, including superdelegates, according to the Associated Press.Mr. Sanders entered March trailing Mrs. Clinton by fewer than 30 delegates after their virtual tie in Iowa and his victory in New Hampshire. But in the March 1 contests, Mr. Sanders won only 347 of the delegates while Mrs. Clinton picked up 518. She swept all five states on March 15 --Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio--and added to her delegate lead.Democrats award delegates in all contests on a proportional basis. Mr. Sanders would need to win almost two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates to clinch the nomination.After a busy March in which Democratic voters in about 30 states and territories cast ballots or caucused, the pace of contests in April and May slows down significantly.After Wisconsin, Wyoming will hold a caucus on April 9. New York's primary is April 19, while Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island hold Democratic contests on April 26.Mr. Sanders is expected to be competitive in many of those races. His campaign won victories in northeastern states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, plus Michigan.Ben Leubsdorf contributed to this article.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Byron Tau",3/29/16
"Bernie Sanders Wins Hawaii, Washington, Alaska Democratic Caucuses; Vermont senator's victories cut into front-runner Hillary Clinton's delegate lead",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775867233?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders swept Saturday's Democratic caucuses, cutting into front-runner Hillary Clinton's formidable lead in delegates.Following the Vermont senator's victories in Alaska and Washington, the Associated Press declared Mr. Sanders the winner of the Hawaii Democratic caucuses.Washington was by far the day's biggest prize, with a total of 101 pledged delegates up for grabs, more than twice that of the other two states combined.In Washington, Mr. Sanders won 72.7% of the vote, while Mrs. Clinton took 27.1%. In Alaska, Mr. Sanders led Mrs. Clinton 81.6% to 18.4%, while in Hawaii, Mr. Sanders garnered 69.8% to Mrs. Clinton's 30%.Mr. Sanders spoke to tens of thousands of supporters in Washington heading into the caucuses.Both Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, also campaigned in the state in the run-up to the caucuses. Clinton campaign officials seemed to recognize that it was facing long odds. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton lost Washington to then-Sen. Barack Obama. The campaign's goal was to keep Mr. Sanders's victory margin and delegate pickup as low as possible.Earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders won in Alaska, which offered just 16 pledged delegates. Still, despite the state being the day's smallest prize, neither the Vermont senator nor Mrs. Clinton wrote off the caucuses.In the run-up to the contest, the former secretary of state called into a radio station and talked about a time after graduating from college when she briefly worked at a fish cannery in Alaska.""And think about this,"" she reportedly told the station, ""I'm the only candidate who's ever actually worked in Alaska. So, hooray!""Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, opened a handful of offices in the state, hoping to string together enough victories that might give superdelegates a reason to rethink their allegiance to Mrs. Clinton.Meanwhile, Hawaii is an impractical place for a candidate visit because of its distance from the mainland. Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Sanders traveled there in advance of the caucuses.But Mr. Sanders aired TV ads aimed at introducing himself to Hawaii voters, and he also showcased the endorsement of a native daughter, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii).In February, Ms. Gabbard said she resigned her spot as Democratic National Committee vice chairwoman so she could campaign for Mr. Sanders.Hawaii has only 25 pledged delegates at stake, but it is one of a series of Western states that the Sanders campaign viewed as winnable and important to mounting a comeback against Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders has a steep uphill battle to gain enough delegates to become the nominee. Mrs. Clinton entered Saturday's contests with a lead of more than 300 among pledged delegates.As Mr. Sanders lost ground to Mrs. Clinton in earlier contests, his campaign asked voters for patience. His advisers have argued that the second half of the primary season, which started this week, would take the race to more favorable terrain--namely, Western states that are more amenable to Mr. Sanders's candidacy and message.While Mr. Sanders's victories in Idaho and Utah on March 22 showed strength in Western states with small Hispanic or African-American populations, Mrs. Clinton has tended to dominate in states with large minority populations.Hawaii's population is more than one-third Asian-American, along with sizable white and native Hawaiian populations. Alaska is almost 15% Native American. And in Washington state, Yakima and Grant counties have large Hispanic populations of 40% or more.Under Democratic rules, delegates are awarded proportionally based on results, not winner take all, so Mr. Sanders not only needs to win the states, but win by large margins, to close the delegate gap with Mrs. Clinton.Meanwhile, a new skirmish over the Democratic debate schedule was brewing, with the two camps unable to reach agreement on dates and locations for the final matchups. Both campaigns consented to face off two more times, once in April and again in May. But several weeks after that pledge was made, the Democratic National Committee still describes all the details of the ninth and 10th debates as ""to be determined.""Party officials say they are waiting for the Clinton and Sanders teams to decide timing and locations. Clinton campaign officials say they are waiting to hear from the DNC. And Sanders aides say they just want to make sure the debates happen.Team Sanders wants to hold the next debate in New York, a delegate-rich state that will hold its primary on April 19. The Clinton camp has declined, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager Jeff Weaver said, and has advocated for a debate in Pennsylvania, where primary voters will go to the polls on April 26.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Colleen McCain Nelson",3/29/16
Election 2016: Washington and Alaska Democrats Gather for Caucuses; Three western states give Bernie Sanders a chance to close the gap with Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775794126?accountid=12768,"Democratic voters caucusing in Washington, Alaska and Hawaii on Saturday give Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders a chance to pick up more state wins and modestly close the gap with front-runner Hillary Clinton in the delegate race.His impressive wins over front-runner Hillary Clinton in Idaho and Utah showed strength in Western states with small Hispanic or African-American populations, blocs where Mrs. Clinton tends to dominate. Another advantage for Mr. Sanders: Saturday's contests are caucuses, not primaries--and he's won seven of nine caucuses so far.But the results of Saturday's caucuses, which had already begun in Washington and Alaska and were to convene later in Hawaii, are difficult to predict because they include some wrinkles in the demographic and geographic sense. Hawaii's population is more than one-third Asian-American, along with sizable white and native Hawaiian populations. Alaska is almost 15% Native American. And within the states there are wide demographic differences at the county level that may yield different results.There also has been little opinion polling ahead of the races.Here's a look at the factors and places to watch in each state.WashingtonThere will be 101 delegates on the line, but most interesting are the demographic questions Washington presents Saturday. It holds a mix of educated young white voters, which are a strength for Mr. Sanders, but it also has dense, populous counties, which have been good to Mrs. Clinton. In the 2012 general election, every county in the state voted for Barack Obama.Read More on Capital Journal* Cruz Gets More Delegates in State He Lost* How Trump's Hard Line on Trade Could Backfire* Democratic Presidential Contest Sparks Tensions on College CampusesKing County, home to more than two million people, will be a bellwether, because it holds the state's largest city, Seattle, and the University of Washington, the state's largest university. The question is whether it votes more like a big city or more like a college town. If it does the latter, Mr. Sanders is likely in for a very big day. One other big campus, Microsoft's, is based here. Mr. Sanders has become a favorite of the tech industry.Snohomish and Pierce counties are the big suburban counties to the north and south of King. Mrs. Clinton likely needs to do well in them if she wants a decent delegate total out of the state. These kinds of counties have generally been good for her, but Snohomish and Pierce have younger populations and the strong tech presence in them could be a challenge for her.Yakima and Grant counties both have large Hispanic populations, each is 40% or more Hispanic. Up to now, Mr. Sanders has largely struggled in such places. Washington offers him a chance to show that he can break through in some Hispanic communities. These two counties will be a test. If Mrs. Clinton wins here, it's a sign her strength with these voters carries to different states.HawaiiIt will proportionally award 25 delegates on Saturday and it went overwhelmingly for Mr. Obama in 2008. He won more than 75% of the vote in every county of his home state, which makes it difficult to get a read on for 2016. While neither Mr. Sanders nor Mrs. Clinton have particularly strong ties to the state, many analysts assume the Vermont senator will do well here because of the state's relatively small African-American and Hispanic populations. It is also one of the most politically liberal states in the union.Honolulu County is the most densely populated in the island chain, holding 70% of its population, and is home to the state capital. If trends from other states hold, that should be a positive for Mrs. Clinton. But Honolulu isn't like other big city counties. It's remarkably diverse, less than 20% of its population is white, non-Hispanic, but the core of its diversity is an enormous Asian-American population. More than 40% of the population is Asian.Considering the primary in California, another state with a large Asian population, is still to come, the vote out of Honolulu could be revealing.AlaskaIt will proportionally award 16 delegates on Saturday, the fewest of the three contests. It doesn't have large African-American or Hispanic populations, which should favor Mr. Sanders. In 2008, the state gave Mr. Obama a huge win, while Mrs. Clinton won less than 25% of the vote. The Clinton team, hoping to prevent those kinds of numbers, has opened a campaign office in Anchorage.Getting a read on the geography of the vote in Alaska will be difficult. Results in Alaska aren't reported by county, but rather by state districts.Write to Dante Chinni at Dante.Chinni@wsj.comCredit: By Dante Chinni",3/29/16
Democratic Presidential Contest Sparks Tensions on College Campuses; Pro-Sanders coalition and smaller group backing Clinton remain deeply at odds at some colleges,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775259592?accountid=12768,"Morgan Johnson, a founder of ""Buckeyes for Bernie"" at Ohio State University, recently received an unwanted invitation from other college Democrats. The pitch to Bernie Sanders supporters: Come on over to Camp Clinton.""They are already trying to facilitate what they're calling a 'unity talk,'"" said Ms. Johnson, a 21-year-old junior. ""I can guarantee that the majority of our supporters--we're not yet interested.""Indeed, while Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has a considerable lead in the contest for delegates, Mr. Sanders's army of campus supporters is holding firm. The Vermont senator himself has said he is staying in the race through the Democratic National Convention in July.Meanwhile, the two contingents of young, primarily first-time voters--the larger pro-Sanders coalition versus the smaller pro-Clinton group--remain deeply at odds at some colleges.""I definitely feel very, very outnumbered,"" said Chloe Atwater, 20, a Clinton supporter who is vice president of the University of Kentucky College Democrats. Ms. Atwater, a junior, said she gets in frequent verbal showdowns with Sanders supporters. ""I feel like the culture has reached a fever pitch,"" she said.The tension is arising partly because while Mrs. Clinton is the front-runner nationally, Mr. Sanders consistently wins among the youngest voters. And Mr. Sanders's youth base could be valuable to the Democratic nominee, whoever that is, in November. By 2012, when President Barack Obama won his second term, 18- to 29-year-olds had grown to 19% of the turnout.Mrs. Clinton has won 57.7% of the vote overall, but only 29.1% of the vote among ages 17-29, according to new data from the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies, which aggregated all the exit polls where possible so far. The former Secretary of State leads among older voters.The numbers are striking given that Mr. Sanders, 74, barely registered among young Democrats in surveys measuring interest in potential presidential candidates last year, said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. ""This is a phenomenon,"" he said. ""There was no conversation a year ago between millennials and Sanders.""The Sanders campaign, Mr. Della Volpe said, tapped into several themes that millennials rank as important: integrity, authenticity and fresh ideas.Mr. Sanders's campus supporters also point to the senator's focus on economic inequality and campaign-finance reform, and to his proposal for free tuition at public colleges.""There is a millennial draw to that,"" said Bridget Silha, 19, a student at Michigan State University. But the statewide campus organizer for Sanders supporters said her own health issues and experience with out-of-pocket medical costs also led her to Mr. Sanders. She believes he would better tackle problems like high pharmaceutical prices.""He's not going to give up without a fight,"" she said.The Clinton campaign says it is trying to reach as many students as possible. It said it has more than 100 campus groups, deploys surrogates to engage millennial audiences, and aggressively reaches out on digital media.While campaigning, Mrs. Clinton has directly addressed young voters, telling them that even if they don't support her, she will support them.Mrs. Clinton's campus backers stress her experience and what they see as her more achievable goals, including her college-affordability plan.""I've always looked up to her,"" said Erica Borsack, 21, a Colgate University senior who is co-president of Colgate for Hillary and is particularly concerned about equal pay for women.While rivalries are friendly on some campuses, clashes are breaking out on others as the race goes on.Among Mr. Sander's campus supporters, one perception is that Clinton college supporters are ""just voting for her because they think she is going to win,"" said Elizabeth Lee, 21, a Middlebury College junior and the founder of College Students for Bernie, a national network of about 200 campus organizations.Clinton backers can find themselves on the defensive.""The people who Bernie finally woke up and made care about politics feel that they're entitled to go after you,"" said Kevin Sabo, 24, a Clinton supporter who is also the political director of California College Democrats.Mr. Sabo, a senior at the University of California, Berkeley, said he is concerned about Mr. Sanders's electability but also believes Mrs. Clinton would get more done once in office.He and his housemates, three Sanders supporters and two Clinton backers among them, argued into the morning recently over the race, he said. ""It got pretty intense even in my own house,"" he said.Ms. Lee, the founder of College Students for Bernie, said she believes that most Sanders supporters would eventually support Mrs. Clinton if she is the nominee.But they aren't ceding ground yet.""It's very much like we're still competing against each other,"" she said.

Kasich, well, he's Kasich.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774983370?accountid=12768,"American politics rarely switches into reverse gear, generationally speaking, but this election will likely prove an exception, amid so many other departures from normality. On the exit of Marco Rubio (date of birth: May 28, 1971), both parties are primed to nominate candidates who are older than Barack Obama (Aug. 4, 1961) and close to George W. Bush (July 6, 1946). More to the point, the debate has a backward-looking register that does not attest to much reflection about the future.The ancient mariners of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton (Oct. 26, 1947) and Bernie Sanders (Sept. 8, 1941), have spent the balance of the campaign litigating the 1990s. The former House representative has assailed the former first lady for Nafta, Wall Street deregulation, welfare reform, the crime bill and other remnants of the era aside from neon leggings and the ""Macarena.""Mrs. Clinton answered his sniping in a Detroit speech this month. She said the defining U.S. challenge is how to ""create the good jobs of the future,"" and ""I don't think we can answer that question by refighting battles from 20 years ago.""But then she warned the audience that her ideas ""might sound quaint"" and spoke affectionately about the union-dominated, corporatist economy of the 1950s. She did also happen to mention the '90s, twice, when ""the typical family's income rose by $10,000. Some of you remember that.""Perhaps the only historical period the Democrats don't want to dissect is the past decade. They repudiate the economic results of Mr. Obama's governance but not his policies, so the post-2008 years are an awkward subject. But voters have been as drawn to a 74-year-old socialist as they've been underwhelmed by the charismatic Mr. Rubio's ""new American century"" because their prospects seem so diminished.Mrs. Clinton recently got in trouble for a gaffe about Nancy Reagan and AIDS, which recalled the 1980s, the decade when the political character of Donald Trump (June 14, 1946)--and his taste--was formed. He's trailed by the ghosts of the past: Leona Helmsley, Le Club restaurant, Spy magazine, the 2004 Israeli Day Parade, Roy Cohn, ""Fat Tony"" Salerno.Mr. Trump says he will make America great again--an inherently nostalgic slogan. For the businessman and his followers, the modern economy isn't an opportunity but a disaster, and he promises to revert to the 20th-century model.""I love the old days, you know,"" Mr. Trump said in February in Las Vegas. ""You know what I hate? There's a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches. We're not allowed to punch back anymore. I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They'd be carried out on a stretcher.""Meanwhile, the political class is helpless to make sense of such statements, or Mr. Trump's rise, without the crutch of historical analogies. Mr. Trump is a new George Wallace, or Benito Mussolini, or Charles Lindbergh; he demands Nazi salutes; the year is 1968, or 1939, or even 1914.Ted Cruz (Dec. 22, 1970) is a younger man selling an older man's agenda, namely, the one that belonged to Ronald Reagan (Feb. 6, 1911). The Texas senator often talks about ""the children of Reagan,"" and he doesn't mean Maureen, Michael, Patti and Ron--his universal solvent for any problem is to ask: WWRD? But the Gipper, himself, didn't appeal to the authority of, say, Chester A. Arthur (Oct. 5, 1829).John Kasich (May 13, 1952) can't go three sentences without mentioning his 1983-2001 tour in the House and his 2011-present Ohio governorship. ""I've done it twice, folks. I'll do it thrice for the United States of America,"" he frequently says. Mr. Kasich is also fond, for reasons known only to him, of name-dropping forgotten political relics like Tim Penny, Trent Lott and Bono.Of course, potential presidents are supposed to talk about what they have achieved in a lower office, such as governor. All campaigns must inevitably dredge through former times, or at least they used to when voters more highly valued experience and qualifications.And yet. Both parties are converging on tribunes who would become a septuagenarian in the White House. When politics assumes such a retrospective and sentimental cast, and so many liberals and conservatives pine for the recovery of a lost order, weird things happen.Mr. Rago is a member of the Journal's editorial board.Credit: By Joseph Rago",3/29/16
Election 2016: Sanders Keeps Up Heat on Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769886495?accountid=12768,"PORTLAND, Maine -- Sen. Bernie Sanders and his top aides showed no sign they would dial back their harsh words for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, and promised to press ahead in the face of her growing delegate lead.At a rally here ahead of Maine's caucuses this Sunday, Mr. Sanders pressed Mrs. Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street firms and mocked the idea that anything she said could have been worth the six-figure speaking fees she collected. He also reminded his audience that Mrs. Clinton once had been considered ""the inevitable nominee.""""Guess what? She's not so inevitable today,"" he said. He celebrated the four states he won in voting on Tuesday without mentioning the seven states -- most of them much bigger -- that she carried.Mr. Sanders has the money to press on as long as he wants, though Democrats may grow impatient with him out of fear that he will damage the woman who may ultimately represent them in November.""Given the current trajectory, there may come a point when he will have to make a judgment about whether he can still win and how aggressively on the attack he wants to be if he can't,"" said David Axelrod, who helped steer President Barack Obama's two victories.The Clinton campaign argued the contest was fast growing out of Mr. Sanders's reach. After Tuesday's voting, her lead among delegates chosen by voters grew to nearly 200, a bigger margin than Mr. Obama ever enjoyed in his 2008 battle for the nomination against Mrs. Clinton.""Over the upcoming weeks, we intend to steadily add to Hillary Clinton's already sizable lead in delegates, and as we do, it will become harder and harder mathematically for Sen. Sanders to ever catch up,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in a ""state of the race"" memo.After Tuesday's voting, Mrs. Clinton was assured of at least 581 pledged delegates, who are chosen by voters, with Mr. Sanders claiming at least 388. The Mook memo contrasts Mr. Sanders's biggest win in his home state of Vermont, where he netted 16 delegates, to Mrs. Clinton's biggest victory of the night, in Texas, where she took 78.Mrs. Clinton also has a huge lead among super delegates, party leaders who can vote for anyone. When those are included, her total tops 1,000, almost halfway to the number needed to clinch.Tad Devine, a senior strategist for Mr. Sanders, said their campaign would make up ground as the race shifts to states with more favorable demographics. Mrs. Clinton's blow-out wins across the South were built on strong support from African-American voters, whereas coming states have larger share of white voters, who support Mr. Sanders in greater numbers.However, after losing the white vote in Nevada, Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday rebounded, capturing 57% of the white vote in Virginia and essentially tying with Mr. Sanders among white voters in Massachusetts. She also won the white vote in Tennessee and Georgia.Mr. Sanders's next opportunity comes this weekend with caucuses in Nebraska and Kansas, as well as Maine. He is also targeting Michigan's primary on Tuesday.""We have to win a lot of places, beginning this weekend, and that's what we intend to do,"" Mr. Devine said.Mr. Mook wrote that Mr. Sanders may win in the weekend's caucuses, but said Mrs. Clinton will more than make up any deficit with a victory in Louisiana, which votes Saturday. If Mr. Sanders wins in Michigan on Tuesday, Mr. Mook said, Mrs. Clinton will offset that with a bigger win in Mississippi, whose primary is the same day.""The end result is that Sen. Sanders will spend millions of dollars in Michigan but not make any net gain in pledged delegates because he isn't competing in states like Mississippi,"" Mr. Mook predicted.But if the race was all but over, it wasn't obvious in Maine, where a line of Sanders supporters snaked for blocks along downtown streets in near-freezing weather waiting to crowd into a local theater to hear him speak.""The states that are coming up are lot more favorable than some of the ones on Super Tuesday, and he has a really good shot,"" said Evan O'Day-Senior, 30 years old.The crowd numbered 2,400, though almost all the faces were white, a sign Mr. Sanders is still struggling to expand his coalition despite his campaign's promises, repeated on Wednesday, to do just that.Given Mrs. Clinton's advantage, some Democrats were itching for Mr. Sanders to tone down his attacks. ""If his goal is to simply deliver a message, he should think twice before criticizing the likely nominee who is on the verge of entering what promises to be a brutal general election campaign that will require Democrats to be unified,"" said Democratic strategist Ben Labolt, a former Obama aide.Sanders aides explicitly rejected any suggestion that he is a ""message candidate,"" and the senator showed no signs of toning down his criticism.Credit: By Laura Meckler and Peter Nicholas",3/29/16
Election 2016: Sanders's Free Tuition Failed Cost Test in Past,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767558334?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Eighteen-year-old Bernie Sanders didn't pay tuition for his freshman year at Brooklyn College in 1959, nor did another 8,000 undergraduates.New York City's public colleges didn't charge tuition back then for students who attended full-time during the day. Students at University of California campuses and a number of other colleges around the country had a similar deal. Although free tuition helped tens of thousands of working-class students afford bachelor degrees, the policy was eventually scrapped as costs escalated.Now, Mr. Sanders wants to reinstate free tuition, but on a scale that dwarfs anything before. Public colleges should be like public high schools, the Vermont Democrat argues: no charge for instruction.The tuition proposal is one of the reasons Mr. Sanders's presidential bid has a big following on campuses, though his plan has been derided by his opponents as pie-in-the-sky or wasteful. Earlier this month, the campaign of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton put out a press release headlined ""Millionaires don't need free college."" She said any tuition assistance should be targeted to the poor or middle class.A look at the history of the free-tuition movement gives a sense of what is politically feasible today, as families struggle with $1.2 trillion of student debt. Free-tuition colleges flourished at a time when student enrollment was small.Not charging for instruction was less a matter of ideology than practicality, say historians. As the industrial revolution reshaped 19th and early 20th century America, city and state legislatures sought to increase the number of teachers, engineers, agricultural experts and others who could help local industries and farms.The University of California dates to 1868 and initially focused on agriculture, mining and medicine. The City University of New York started as the Free Academy of New York in 1849, which educated immigrants, and morphed into a broader university. For many years, the State University of New York's ""normal"" schools, which trained future teachers, also didn't charge tuition.Even those state colleges that had tuition charged minimal amounts. In 1933, the average in-state undergraduate tuition, plus fees, was about $1,100 in today's dollars, according estimates by Harvard University economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz.State colleges could charge so little because relatively few people went to college. In 1959, when Mr. Sanders studied at Brooklyn College, 2.2 million students attended public colleges nationally, the Education Department estimates. Enrollment now is 15.3 million. The cost of educating so many more students outstripped the willingness -- or ability -- of legislatures to pay the tab.The City University of New York started charging for tuition in 1976 after the city teetered on the brink of bankruptcy, and the university ran out of money.In both New York and California, free tuition packed a powerful political punch and was only discarded under economic duress. Even during New York City's financial crisis, the city initially rejected termination of free tuition, wrote Judith Glazer Raymo, an emeritus professor at Long Island University, in a history of free tuition.That broad base of support is a big reason Mr. Sanders wants universal free tuition at state schools instead of targeting middle- and lower-income students. Think of Social Security, said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's policy director.If you limit the program, ""after a while, people complain that it's just a welfare program"" and political support evaporates, he said.But making the program universal drives up costs, which the Sanders campaign estimates at $750 billion over 10 years. Mr. Sanders would pay for that by taxing the sales of securities, a plan bound to encounter fierce resistance from Wall Street.Credit: By Bob Davis",3/29/16
Politics & Ideas: Bad Math for Cruz and Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767518796?accountid=12768,"The two most important numbers to emerge from last Saturday's contests are 22 and 27.The former is the percentage of the African-American vote Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received in losing Nevada's Democratic caucuses by six points to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. By contrast, according to the entrance polls, Mr. Sanders split the white vote with Mrs. Clinton.This leaves Mr. Sanders with a large strategic challenge. While African-Americans made up only 13% of caucus-goers in Nevada, they are likely to form more than half of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina on Saturday.Following a timely endorsement from South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in the House of Representatives, this crucial bloc of voters appears poised to deliver a solid majority to Mrs. Clinton. And African-Americans make up a substantial share of the Democratic base throughout the South, including 51% in Alabama and Georgia and 48% in Louisiana. Latinos make up about 30% of the Democratic primary vote in Texas and California. But in the other contests between now and mid-March, their share is certain to be much lower.Surprisingly, Mr. Sanders was not able to garner strong majorities among groups where he was expected to do well. Despite his class-based program and strong ideological appeal, he could gain no better than an even split with Mrs. Clinton among caucus-goers without college degrees and with incomes under $50,000. Even among caucus-goers who regard themselves as ""very liberal,"" he won by a narrow margin of 52% to 47%, not nearly enough to counterbalance Mrs. Clinton's 22-point edge among self-styled moderates.Voters who want policies more liberal than President Obama's went for Mr. Sanders by 77% to 21%, compared with the 75% to 22% edge Mrs. Clinton received from voters who want to continue on Mr. Obama's course. Unfortunately for Mr. Sanders, the ""let us continue"" faction of the party outnumbered its ""to the left, march"" counterpart by nine percentage points.Unless these dynamics change dramatically in the next few days, the vote in South Carolina, where Mrs. Clinton currently enjoys a double-digit advantage, should restore her standing as the strong front-runner for her party's presidential nomination.The second crucial number -- 27 -- is the percentage of the evangelical vote Texas Sen. Ted Cruz received in South Carolina. This result goes to the heart of Mr. Cruz's meticulously scripted strategy for winning his party's nomination by establishing a dominant position among evangelicals as well as committed conservatives.Mr. Cruz did reasonably well among very conservative primary voters, receiving 35%, ahead of Donald Trump's 29% and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 19%. But among evangelical voters, Mr. Cruz lost to Mr. Trump by six points while gaining only a modest advantage over Mr. Rubio. He also lost evangelicals to Mr. Trump in New Hampshire.If this pattern of weak evangelical support continues, it is hard to see Mr. Cruz's path to victory, because his sharply etched profile limits his appeal outside his base. In South Carolina, for example, only 17% of ""somewhat conservative"" voters and 7% of moderates supported him, and his showing among nonevangelical voters was a meager 13%.And despite his outsider stance since arriving in Washington, he lost to Mr. Trump by a staggering 50 points, 63% to 13%, among the 48% of South Carolina Republicans who want a president from outside the establishment. Even if Mr. Cruz prevails in Texas on March 1, the rationale for his candidacy has been weakened, perhaps fatally.Although Ohio Gov. John Kasich has run a strong, positive campaign, gaining many admirers along the way, he is almost certainly too moderate -- at least as conservatism has been redefined during the past two decades -- to gain a plurality of his party's base.A Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday suggests that Mr. Kasich will be hard-pressed to prevail against Mr. Trump even in his home state of Ohio, where he was re-elected as governor with 64% of the vote in November 2014.If lifelong Republicans are to block Mr. Trump's hostile takeover of their party, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's withdrawal from the race leaves them with only one realistic option: Marco Rubio. The question is whether they can coalesce around him in time to stop Mr. Trump, and whether they are willing to undertake the no-holds-barred effort needed to unmask him. We will soon learn if Republican leaders will mount a real fight or meekly surrender.A surprising number of Republicans have told me privately, and some are now saying publicly, that they cannot support Mr. Trump as their party's nominee. Last week, William Kristol, the editor of the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, floated the possibility of backing an independent conservative candidacy. This would not be the strangest thing to happen in a very strange election year.Credit: By William A. Galston",3/29/16
"Hillary & Bernie, Tax Fantasists; Soak-the-rich proposals ignore history and wouldn't raise nearly enough money to fund big spending plans.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776190339?accountid=12768,"Here is a question to ask Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders: What is the best tax rate to impose on high-income earners to ensure there is enough government revenue to pay for your trillion-dollar promises to voters?Perhaps they think it is 83%, a rate that economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez hypothesized in 2014 in a widely circulated paper . Or maybe it is 90%, which Sen. Sanders told CNBC last May was not out of the question. ""Our job is not to think small,"" Mr. Sanders elaborated in the Huffington Post a month later. ""It is to think big.""Progressives have often reminded us that the U.S. had such rates in the past. From 1936 to 1980, the highest federal income-tax rate was never below 70%, and the top rate exceeded 90% from 1951 to 1963. Under Ronald Reagan, the top federal rate declined to 28% by 1988 and has never reached 40% since.The discussion of these rates can easily create the impression that the federal government collected far more money from ""the rich"" before the Reagan administration. And it can also leave another impression: There would be no downside to raising rates to 1950s levels, given that decade's prosperity.Neither impression would be correct. The effective tax rates actually paid by the highest income earners during the 1950s and early '60s were far lower than the highest marginal rates. Few taxpayers reached the top brackets, the code was rife with loopholes, and capital gains were taxed at much lower rates.In the 1960s, for example, the average rate paid by the top 0.1% of tax filers--the top 10th of the top 1%--ranged from 26.5% to 29.5%, according to a 2007 study by Messrs. Piketty and Saez. Even during the 20 years after the Reagan tax cuts, the top 10th of the top 1% paid an average rate of 23.7% to 33%--essentially the same as in the 1960s. In the decade following 2001, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the average rate for this elite group never exceeded 32%.Nostalgia aside for a world that never existed, few people paid the top tax rates of the 1950s and early 1960s. Of course, when they did, the top marginal rates applied only to income above a very high threshold. The top ordinary income rate married couples faced in 1960, 91%, applied only to income above $2.5 million in today's dollars.Suppose a President Clinton or Sanders tried to raise effective tax rates paid by a significant number of upper-income earners through very high top rates. What then? Real damage, according to Mr. Piketty. In a 2009 debate with the Cato Institute's Chris Edwards in the Economist, Mr. Piketty said, ""I firmly believe, that imposing a 70% or 80% marginal rate on large segments of the population (say, 25% of the population, or even 10%, or even a few percentage points) would lead to an economic disaster."" In other words, sayonara increased tax revenue.Even without disaster, however, it is unclear whether higher rates on the upper echelons of the top 1% would bring in more revenue. I've compared the Piketty-Saez estimates of average federal income-tax rates paid by the top 10th of the top 1% with the revenue collected at the federal level from the same group. The result? From the mid-1960s through the '80s, trends in the average tax rates paid at the top compared with their tax revenues are mirror images. When average tax rates went up from 27.6% in 1965 to 34% in 1975, revenues went down, from 0.6% to 0.5% of the sum of GDP plus capital gains. When average tax rates declined to 23.7% over the second half of the 1970s and the '80s, tax revenues from the top went up, reaching 0.8% of GDP plus capital gains in 1990.This makes intuitive sense. Of all Americans, it is the wealthy who are more likely to take advantage of legal ways to reduce their payments when rates rise. Plus, their work and investment decisions are more sensitive to the after-tax payoff.Admittedly, in the early 1990s, Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton raised average tax rates at the top, and revenue from the top 0.1% eventually skyrocketed. But the flood of revenue overwhelmingly reflected not the increase in rates but the stock market's takeoff beginning in late 1994, which resulted in a corresponding rise in income from capital gains and stock options.Consider: If the higher top tax rates had caused the growth in revenue, then revenues should have fallen when Mr. Clinton cut the top tax rate on capital gains to 20% from 28% in 1997. But revenues from the top 0.1% kept pouring in.Proposals to soak the rich by raising their tax rates are unlikely to yield the revenue windfall that Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton are dangling before voters. Leveling with the American people means either scaling back their agendas or admitting that they will have to raise the money from tax hikes on middle-class voters.Mr. Winship is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.Credit: By Scott Winship",3/30/16
Candidates' Zero-Sum Worldview Is Wrong; Trump and Sanders also must share a degree of hubris that makes them believe that they can perform better in a zero-sum world than any predecessor.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775731875?accountid=12768,"Paul Rubin addresses ""The Zero-Sum Worlds of Trump and Sanders "" (op-ed, March 21) that underpins their policy proposals and reflects an odd intellectual kinship. Both candidates view economic matters in a win-lose framework where macro factors such as jobs or wealth are fixed rather than dynamic. Donald Trump aims to make America great again by adopting mercantilist protectionist measures (antitrade or anti-immigrant) that invariably backfire, while Sen. Bernie Sanders aims to make America a more just nation by adopting socialist income-redistribution schemes that invariably fail.Given the consistently dismal historical records of mercantilism and socialism in recent centuries, Messrs. Trump and Sanders also must share a degree of hubris that makes them believe that they can perform better in a zero-sum world than any predecessor. Mr. Rubin mentions just a few of the variables and feedback loops that complicate the web of connections between higher tax rates and individual work effort or between higher trade barriers and consumer prices. There are hundreds of millions of workers, consumers and taxpayers making decisions that can override or magnify the top-down directives of Mr. Trump or Sen. Sanders. Although Sen. Sanders comes across as much humbler than Mr. Trump, there is an underlying assumption in his zero-sum world that he can oversee the bureaucratic forces and technical experts who will make top-down resource decisions that are far superior to billions of individual bottom-up decisions.A simplistic zero-sum worldview is dangerous, but it takes an unhealthy dose of leadership hubris to maximize its destructive power.Gary DanielsSarasota, Fla.Mr. Rubin incorrectly attributes zero-sum thinking to Messrs. Trump and Sanders. Instead, he should consider their approach to the rule of law. Mr. Trump insists that our country is the property of its legal citizens. He insists that people obey the law on immigration, entitlements, identity theft and fraud, and he insists that other countries must accept our trade as we do theirs. He will build a wall to keep people out. Mr. Sanders denies property rights like Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Castro and Chávez before him, and he consciously intends to repeat their mistakes. Like his predecessors, he will have to build a wall to keep people in.Bart BesselingFoster City, Calif.Prof. Rubin and his fellow economists too often identify what is easy to measure. But what may matter the most to most Americans isn't so easy to measure: the cost to a family whose breadwinner is unable to work full-time or at all, of having to train your newly arrived foreign replacement for your own job, the trauma of having a loved one murdered or raped by an illegal who was allowed to remain here after being processed for a violent crime or a terrorist attack facilitated by our open borders. Most important, how do such costs affect our unique American culture? There are no benefits to measure, with costs too painful to consider.Martin GansKentfield, Calif.",3/30/16

We'll finally be able to count votes for the presidential nominations, rather than dissect polls that have been notably inaccurate in recent elections.The Republican caucuses will test whether Donald Trump can translate his large crowds and celebrity into actual voters who will sit in a cold gymnasium for hours; whether the Christian right has the clout to deliver the victory that Ted Cruz has long predicted; or whether Marco Rubio's recent momentum will make him the leading alternative to the top two heading into New Hampshire next week. In any event the Iowa vote won't come close to deciding the GOP nominee.The Iowa stakes are far higher for the Democrats because Bernie Sanders needs to win to show he can be a viable national candidate. The Vermont socialist has been getting plenty of media attention, and his fund raising from small donors has been impressive, including $20 million in January. His campaign says 1.3 million people have made 3.25 million donations to the Sanders campaign, which speaks to his populist appeal on the political left.His problem is that while the Republican ""establishment"" is largely a fiction, there really is a Democratic establishment -- and it's lined up for Hillary Clinton. This Democratic machine includes public unions, especially the teachers who endorsed Mrs. Clinton much earlier than they normally do. It includes the lobbies of the cultural left, such as Planned Parenthood that has endorsed Mrs. Clinton despite Mr. Sanders' progressive bona fides. It even includes President Obama, who publicly tilted to Mrs. Clinton in a Politico interview only days before the Iowa voting.This machine is all coming together in Iowa to knock Mr. Sanders out in the first round. Even if he wins next week in New Hampshire, an Iowa defeat will show how hard it would be for Mr. Sanders' idealistic irregulars to beat the Democratic machine in the rest of the country. But if he does win in Iowa, it will be a bigger upset than anything on the Republican side.",3/30/16

When superdelegates are thrown in, her lead grows to 1,712 to 1,011.Recognizing that Mrs. Clinton had huge advantages in Southern states on Super Tuesday, March 1, the Sanders campaign says it largely wrote them off. Instead, the campaign focused its energies on more promising states--Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma, among them--in hopes of notching some victories and showing Mrs. Clinton was beatable.""Those eight states where we didn't compete on Super Tuesday have resulted in almost all of her pledged delegate advantage right now,"" Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine told reporters this week in a conference call.When Mr. Sanders competes with her head-to-head, he does better, Mr. Devine said. ""We have a very good chance of beating her in every single place where we compete with her,"" he said.A problem with that argument is that the race comes down to who has the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, not who scored the most impressive or surprising wins.But Sanders advisers hope their reasoning will make an impression on superdelegates: the party leaders and elected officials who are free to support whomever they choose. The idea is if Mr. Sanders can spread doubt among superdelegates about Mrs. Clinton's electability and persuade them he is the one with the momentum, then perhaps they'll abandon Mrs. Clinton.Sanders supporters are frustrated by the delegate math. Having come from nowhere, Mr. Sanders is now on a roll. He won landslide victories last week in Hawaii, Washington and Alaska. Next week is the Wisconsin primary and the Clinton campaign seems to be bracing for another loss. Mrs. Clinton flew home from Wisconsin on Tuesday night to campaign in New York.But unless Mrs. Clinton loses handily in some of the delegate-rich states coming up--New York, California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey--she'll remain on a glide path to the nomination.Eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton found herself in the same position as Mr. Sanders. Powered by huge support among black voters, then-Sen. Barack Obama rolled up a lead that he never relinquished. Much like the Sanders campaign is doing now, the Clinton campaign in 2008 questioned Mr. Obama's electability and made the case to superdelegates that she was the safer bet.Still, the Clinton campaign is having none of Mr. Sanders's argument. After the Sanders campaign conference call, Clinton aide Jesse Ferguson tweeted: ""Summary of Sanders spin today: Voters only count for real or mean anything when they vote for Sanders.""Credit: By Peter Nicholas",3/31/16
"The Trump-Sanders China Syndrome; The charge of currency manipulation was always off-base, but now it's starting to look ludicrous.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776469836?accountid=12768,"Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, with a phalanx of lawmakers behind them, continue to bash China as a ""currency manipulator."" Both men claim that Beijing is engaged in a permanent strategy to keep the yuan weak and prop up its trade surplus. But the reality was never that simple, and the charge is ludicrous at present.Beijing began pegging its currency to the U.S. dollar over two decades ago, as part of its plan to integrate the Chinese economy into a global marketplace in which transactions were overwhelmingly priced in dollars. It stuck by this strategy even during the height of the Asian financial crisis, in 1998, when much of the world was expecting it to devalue. This earned it great praise from the U.S. government. ""China, by maintaining its exchange rate policy,"" pronounced President Clinton's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, ""has been an important island of stability in a turbulent region.""But once market pressures reversed, and capital began flowing into China, U.S. lawmakers suddenly decided that currency stability was bad: They wanted the yuan to rise, while China continued to keep it fixed. In a 2006 op-ed for this newspaper, Sens. Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham declared that ""one of the fundamental tenets of free trade is that currencies should float."" Such a tenet, remarkably, was unknown to either Adam Smith or John Maynard Keynes, neither of whom ever supported any such thing.Fast forward to 2016, and capital is now flowing out of China at a prodigious rate. In an effort to slow the resulting fall in its currency, China's central bank has been selling vast amounts of dollars and buying up yuan. At $3.2 trillion, China's reserves still seem enormous. But they are down $790 billion from their 2014 peak, and $325 billion in the past four months.At this pace of decline, China's reserves will fall to $2.8 trillion in July. To put this in perspective, China, using the International Monetary Fund's framework for reserve-adequacy measurement, needs to hold between $2.8 trillion and $4.2 trillion in reserves to safeguard against a balance-of-payments crisis. Once reserves fall below an adequate precautionary level, China is at risk of being unable to pay for essential imports or its dollar debts. The IMF estimate could be overly cautious, given China's relatively low level of external debt, but it could also be too sanguine in that some significant portion of China's reserves, estimated to be around a third, is believed to be tied up in nonliquid assets--and unavailable in a crisis. These include China's capital commitment to the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.So what can China do to stanch the rapid decline in reserves?The country has for years been pursuing what has been called the ""Impossible Trinity"": controlling interest and exchange rates while leaving the capital account significantly open. Chinese residents are permitted to send up to $50,000 overseas annually and this is enough to allow trillions in outflows. China could impose tighter capital controls to prevent this, as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda recently urged it to do. This would allow it to operate safely with fewer reserves. The adequate level of precautionary reserves falls to between $1.7 trillion and $2.6 trillion when adjusted for capital controls. But this would put a halt to China's plans to transform the yuan into a major reserve currency--something it will be reluctant to do.China could also raise interest rates, which might encourage capital inflows and discourage outflows, but this would hurt growth in an already sinking economy.Finally, China could let the exchange rate fall significantly, but this would increase the debt burden on Chinese companies. Outstanding dollar credit to Chinese nonfinancial companies is estimated to be around $1 trillion. Too great a fall in the yuan, coupled with slowing economic growth, could precipitate a corporate solvency crisis.That China has no good options, and only a choice among painful ones, reflects the underlying structural problem in the Chinese economy--one that will take many years to fix. The economy was tooled to support grossly overoptimistic expectations of foreign demand for Chinese exports. Retooling it to encourage domestic demand will require time and a willingness by the Chinese government to allow businesses to die so that more promising ones may live.It also shows that American charges that China's currency was massively undervalued were based on the flawed assumption that capital would want, indefinitely, only to get into China and not out. It's a sure bet no one in Washington will be calling for China to float its currency again anytime soon.Mr. Steil is director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of ""The Battle of Bretton Woods"" (Princeton University Press, 2013).

Clinton-Sanders Feuding Escalates as Key Contests Loom; Sanders advisers demand Clinton apologize for saying they were 'lying' about money she has gotten from oil and gas industry,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777609946?accountid=12768,"SYRACUSE, N.Y.--Feuding between Hillary Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, escalated to new levels this past week, with the Vermont senator's campaign advisers demanding she apologize for saying they were ""lying"" about money she has gotten from the oil and gas industry.Campaigning nonstop, both candidates are showing flashes of fatigue and impatience as the race barrels toward a series of key contests later this month in the delegate-rich states of New York and Pennsylvania. The sour tone could make it more difficult for the party to unify after the race is settled. A Wall Street Journal-NBC poll last month showed one-third of Sanders supporters can't see themselves voting for Mrs. Clinton in the fall if she becomes the nominee.Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates, but she has lost five of the past six contests, and her campaign concedes she will be hard-pressed to win Wisconsin, where the primary is Tuesday. She is heading back there Saturday after three days of campaigning in New York. Fearing Wisconsin might be a lost cause, her staff once had considered making no more trips to the state and instead focusing on coming contests.An indication of the contest's current tenor came at what began as a routine a campaign stop in Purchase, N.Y., on Thursday that ultimately produced one of the tensest moments Mrs. Clinton has had on the trail.A group of Sanders supporters interrupted her speech, chanting, ""If she wins, we lose."" As they walked out, Mrs. Clinton said: ""The Bernie people came to say that. We're very sorry you're leaving.""Later, on the rope line, a Greenpeace organizer asked about her campaign contributions from the fossil-fuel industry. Mrs. Clinton shook her finger at the woman, 26-year-old Eva Resnick-Day, and angrily said: ""I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about that. I'm sick of it.""Ms. Resnick-Day said in an interview she was surprised by Mrs. Clinton's retort. In past encounters with Greenpeace activists, Mrs. Clinton has been cordial in discussing her record, Ms. Resnick-Day said.A Clinton senior adviser, Jennifer Palmieri, said Mrs. Clinton was annoyed because she believed her record had been distorted. She has long supported renewable energy and is not beholden to the fossil-fuels industry, she said.""Does it annoy her when people misrepresent her record? It does. And that's what you saw"" on the rope line, Ms. Palmieri said.Steve Schmidt, a senior strategist in Republican John McCain's 2008 presidential bid, described Mrs. Clinton's reaction as the sort of ""tell"" one sees in a poker game--a reflection of Mrs. Clinton's frustration that Mr. Sanders is hanging on.""What it shows is Bernie Sanders is getting under her skin,"" Mr. Schmidt said.Republicans circulated the video in hopes that it would produce a backlash that damages Mrs. Clinton.""The finger in the face, hammering away with it, is not a good look, usually, in politics,"" said Bill Cunningham, a political consultant who has worked for Republicans and Democrats alike.Yet the incident also provided a rare window into the emotions of Mrs. Clinton, who seldom veers off script and has faced criticism for lacking authenticity. Some voters might sympathize with her for a human reaction to what she saw as an unfair attack, other analysts said.Democratic political consultant Steve McMahon, who isn't aligned in the race, said the exchange would only humanize Mrs. Clinton.""If you believe your opponent is lying about your record consistently and maliciously, this kind of a reaction is perfectly understandable and perfectly natural,"" he said.Clinton aides say what money the campaign has gotten from oil and gas interests is largely coming from workers who happen to like the former secretary of state. Employees in the oil and gas industry have donated $307,561 to the Clinton campaign, of a total of $160 million she has raised to date, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.The industry has given an additional $25,701 to outside groups backing the campaign, which have raised more than $55 million on her behalf. And registered lobbyists with clients in the oil and gas industry have raised more than $600,000.Mr. Sanders's campaign has received $53,760 from oil and gas industry employees.The oil and gas industry is far from Mrs. Clinton's largest backer. Wall Street, for example, has given more than $21 million to her campaign and outside groups supporting her.No apology from the Clinton campaign appears in the works. ""Apologize for what? No."" Ms. Palmieri said.Erica Orden and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",4/2/16

Bernie Sanders's Cash Keeps Flowing; Candidate's $44 million haul from donors in March ensures race will continue for months,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778090011?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to rake in contributions for his presidential run despite remaining a clear underdog in the race for the Democratic nomination, all but ensuring his battle with Hillary Clinton will continue for months.Mr. Sanders's latest fundraising haul --$44 million in March--was amassed as his path to the nomination narrowed substantially, leaving him with a daunting deficit in convention delegates. Such a feat amounts to defying political gravity, campaign-finance experts say: When candidates start losing primaries, as Mr. Sanders did during the first half of the month, the flow of donations typically slows significantly.But Mr. Sanders's fundraising has continued apace, fueled largely by small-dollar online donors. Now, after wins in a string of Western states in late March, the Vermont senator hits April with both money and fresh momentum. He holds a narrow lead over Mrs. Clinton for Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls, and the New York primary two weeks later looms as a pivotal showdown.The importance of the New York contest for both campaigns is evident in the haggling this past weekend over where and when the candidates might debate ahead of the April 19 vote.Mr. Sanders's fundraising totals have grown each month this year, hitting $21.3 million in January and $43.5 million in February. Mrs. Clinton hasn't yet released her take from last month, but Mr. Sanders raised more than she did in January and February.Although Mr. Sanders has won five of the past six contests, Mrs. Clinton still holds a commanding lead in delegates that her campaign argues is nearly insurmountable. Mr. Sanders now needs decisive victories in delegate-rich states such as New York, California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to make up ground, and he may also need to convince party officials known as ""superdelegates"" to abandon Mrs. Clinton and support him. Absent those outcomes, Mrs. Clinton appears likely to emerge as the Democratic nominee, but Mr. Sanders could make that an expensive proposition.Mr. Sanders ""is not suffering the fate that candidates usually suffer when they're running behind,"" said Lawrence Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a group that aims to reduce the influence of money in politics. ""The narrative that it's impossible to beat Hillary Clinton has not stopped [Sanders supporters] because I don't think they believe it,"" Mr. Noble said.In interviews, many Sanders supporters said they were motivated by the senator's pledges to address income inequality and overhaul the campaign-finance system, and they plan to continue lending financial support until the end. Only 3% of Mr. Sanders's fundraising total has come from donors who have given the legal maximum of $2,700, and many backers have signed up to automatically contribute a modest sum each month.Aislinn Melchior, a professor from Tacoma, Wash., who has made several small contributions, said of Mr. Sanders: ""I am willing to do whatever I can to help out his candidacy, even if it's doomed.""Kenneth Pennington, digital director for the Sanders campaign, said the senator's supporters understand that building a grass-roots movement doesn't happen overnight.""They're in this fight for the long haul,"" he said. ""That means when we win, our supporters respond in large numbers. When we lose, our supporters step up to help us win in the long run.""The practical effect of Mr. Sanders's fundraising has been to extend the race, allowing the Vermont senator to continue his campaign likely until the Democratic National Convention in July. With contributions pouring in, Mr. Sanders can afford to match Mrs. Clinton dollar for dollar, forcing the former New York senator and secretary of state to continue to spend heavily on a primary campaign just as she hoped to be pivoting to the general election.Anthony Corrado Jr., professor of government at Colby College in Maine, said it is virtually unprecedented for a candidate who is trailing in the polls this late in the primary season to continue to raise funds at this rate.""This is usually the point where you see all the money break toward the front-runner,"" he said.Perhaps more notable is the fact that Mr. Sanders has built a fundraising juggernaut with a record-setting share of small donations, Mr. Corrado said.President Barack Obama set the high-water marks for attracting small-dollar contributions in 2008 and again in 2012, but Mr. Sanders has raised more money from small donors at this point in the campaign than any previous candidate in history, he said.At the end of February, 56% of Mr. Sanders's fundraising had come from individuals who had contributed a total of $200 or less, Mr. Corrado said. Only 21% of Mrs. Clinton's haul through February came from donors who contributed $200 or less, he said. At the same point in the 2008 cycle, Mr. Obama had raised 28% of his total from those small donors.Clinton campaign officials have said that early in the year, many of their supporters didn't view this as a competitive race or feel a sense of urgency. Josh Schwerin, a Clinton spokesman, said a recent surge in contributions put the campaign over the one-million-donor mark a few weeks ago. Sanders campaign officials said they have received contributions from about two million donors.""We've seen tremendous growth in our online grass-roots fundraising over the past few months, with more than half the money we raised in February and March coming in online,"" Mr. Schwerin said.Despite an increase in online donations, Mrs. Clinton continues to devote a substantial amount of time to closed-door fundraisers, events that take her off the campaign trail. During the past week, she attended a fundraiser in New Jersey, two in Massachusetts, two in New York and another in Illinois.Meantime, more than 94% of Mr. Sanders's fundraising has been done online. For Team Sanders, the key number is $27--the oft-repeated figure that represents the average contribution to his campaign. Campaign-finance reports show thousands of individuals contributing that amount to the senator's cause.Brittany Hodge, a 25-year-old rap musician from Homestead, Fla., has donated a total of $511 to the Sanders campaign in small increments, inspired by campaign email pleas for support.""I find myself watching the election coverage and getting really into it, and I'll find myself donating $10 three times in one day,"" Ms. Hodge said. ""Whether he wins or he loses, both of those kind of motivate me to make donations.""Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",4/4/16
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Spar Over Debates; Campaigns say sticking points remain before a deal to meet before the New York primary,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777842018?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sounded hopeful that they could break an impasse and hold a debate before the New York primary on April 19, though their campaigns made clear Sunday that sticking points remain unresolved.""I want it. Look, I'm confident that there will be"" a debate, Mrs. Clinton said on NBC. But as the day wore on, a standoff continued.The Sanders campaign said Sunday afternoon that it had accepted an invitation to take part in a prime-time debate next Sunday on NBC. However, the Clinton campaign hasn't agreed to show up.A Clinton spokesman said the former senator and secretary of state is open to two other possibilities: a debate on the cable news channel NY1 on April 14, or on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" the following day. Mr. Sanders's campaign dislikes both those options.On the night of the 14th, the Sanders campaign says it has a rally planned in New York City and has already gotten the necessary park permits. As for ""Good Morning America,"" the Sanders campaign said it would prefer a prime-time network debate that is bound to draw a larger audience.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Mr. Sanders said his preference is to debate at a time when ""people are going to be watching it,"" and he added: ""I think we can work that out.""It hasn't been easy. Earlier in the weekend, a debate looked to be in doubt. The Clinton campaign had issued a statement contending it had offered three possible dates for another debate--and all were rejected by Team Sanders.The Sanders camp replied that one of those dates was Monday, when the NCAA men's basketball championship game would be on and relatively few viewers would be likely to tune in.As the impasse has played out, the Sanders campaign has begun to voice frustration. Sanders media spokesman Michael Briggs said that the Vermont senator was available to debate any day between April 10 and April 13.""He looks forward to a debate on any of those nights. Does she really have fundraisers on each of those nights?"" Mr. Briggs said in a statement.The candidates have taken part in eight debates thus far and had said they would hold two more--one this month and one in May.Each has a different agenda when it comes to additional debates. Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in convention delegates and has no wish to commit a televised gaffe that might give the Sanders campaign new life.At one point last month it seemed she was prepared to walk away from any more debates. Her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said her priority was campaigning in states that have yet to hold contests.Joel Benenson, a pollster and senior strategist for Mrs. Clinton, has suggested that Mr. Sanders might have to drop his attacks on Mrs. Clinton if there were to be more debates.In an interview Sunday, Mr. Benenson didn't mention any such conditions and expressed optimism that differences would be resolved.""I assume they want a debate and we want a debate and it'll get worked out,"" Mr. Benenson said.He added that ""debates have been very good for Hillary Clinton. She loves debating and probably has done more debates than any presidential candidate in history"" between her 2008 and 2016 presidential bids.Mrs. Clinton eight years ago was in a position comparable to that of Mr. Sanders now. She was trailing then-Sen. Barack Obama in delegates and was eager for more debates, looking for a game-changing moment.In an interview she gave to a South Dakota newspaper in May 2008--one month before she withdrew from the race--she said a presidential candidate should be willing to debate ""anytime, anywhere"" given the supreme importance of the job.For the Sanders campaign, a debate isn't of much value if few viewers see it. Trailing in pledged delegates, Mr. Sanders wants the largest possible audience and a forum that might shake up the race and pry so-called superdelegates--party officials who are free to support any candidate--from the Clinton camp.So, an NBC News debate next Sunday would be an attractive forum for the Vermont senator.""This is by far the largest possible audience. That's what we want. I hope she does, too,"" Mr. Briggs said.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",4/4/16

Campaign-finance reports show thousands of individuals contributing that amount to the senator's cause.Brittany Hodge, a 25-year-old rap musician from Homestead, Fla., has donated a total of $511 to the Sanders campaign in small increments, inspired by campaign email pleas for support.""I find myself watching the election coverage and getting really into it, and I'll find myself donating $10 three times in one day,"" Ms. Hodge said. ""Whether he wins or he loses, both of those kind of motivate me to make donations.""Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",4/4/16

Sanders Steps Up Clinton Attacks,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761395396?accountid=12768,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders, closing out his campaign in Iowa, took a strategic gamble in hopes of notching a victory over Hillary Clinton in the state's Democratic caucuses Monday night: He went negative.The Sanders campaign ran a new TV spot that implies Mrs. Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street. And after refusing to talk about the Democratic front-runner's use of a private email server as secretary of state, Mr. Sanders on Sunday called her email practices a ""very serious issue"" that could render her unelectable.Similarly, a Clinton campaign that had once ignored the 74-year-old democratic socialist is now casting him as a pie-in-the-sky dreamer whose ideas are utterly impractical.""I don't want to over-promise and under-deliver. I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver,"" she said at a rally here. She added: ""I know what it's going to take.""This wasn't the way many thought the Democratic primary would conclude before the balloting began.When he jumped in the race in May, Mr. Sanders looked to many Democratic officials like a candidate who wanted a forum to talk about income inequality in America and who didn't really believe he could win. But the Vermont senator's success at raising money and attracting young voters has upended the race. The Sanders campaign announced Sunday it had raised $20 million in January alone.On the eve of the caucuses, Iowa was up for grabs. Given the stakes, both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns are offering some sharp assessments of the opposition.Assessing the new tone, Matthew Dowd, a former strategist to President George W. Bush, said: ""It's been ratcheted up. Hillary understands that if she wins Iowa, she basically begins to end the race. Bernie realizes that the whole premise of his race is contingent on winning Iowa, and he's trying to do whatever he possibly can at this point to get over the hump.""Spotlighting a vulnerability, Mr. Sanders is making the case that Mrs. Clinton is beholden to Wall Street. Speaking to reporters at a Bloomberg Politics breakfast last week, he mentioned that Mrs. Clinton had just attended a fundraising event at a Philadelphia investment firm.""That's how she has raised money throughout her political career,"" he said. ""Millions of dollars from Wall Street and from other very powerful special interests.""The combative posture poses risks for Mr. Sanders -- something his team acknowledges. He has pledged to usher in a more uplifting style of politics. He has said he would inspire voters and thus expand turnout on Election Day much as Barack Obama did eight years earlier.Recognizing the potential damage to the Sanders brand, his aides say there are lines he won't cross: He won't air the classic political attack ad complete with ominous music and unflattering pictures of Mrs. Clinton.""He's not going to go there; it's not in the cards,"" said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders campaign strategist.So, instead, some of Mr. Sanders's ads leave it to voters to connect the dots. The latest spot features Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and its role in the 2008 financial collapse. No pictures of Mrs. Clinton's face appear in the ad; her name is never mentioned. Yet she is the star.Mrs. Clinton and her husband have a long history of dealings with Goldman. Together, they have collected nearly $3 million in speaking fees from the company since 2005.In the spot, a narrator says that ""millions in campaign contributions and speaking fees"" enabled Wall Street firms to engage in reckless practices.In an interview with NBC News over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton said her opponent's method is to discredit her through ""insinuation and implication.""""That's disappointing,"" she added, ""because he's always prided himself on being a candidate, a politician -- he's been in politics a really long time -- not to go negative.""As the campaign unfolds Mr. Sanders has flashed increasing irritation at some of the criticism lodged by Team Clinton. Clinton allies have said that Mr. Sanders's socialist views would be exploited by Republicans in a general election.On Sunday, Mr. Sanders tried to turn the tables. Asked by ABC News if he would get ""slapped"" with the socialist label should he win the party's nomination, he pointed to recent disclosures that top secret information passed through Mrs. Clinton's private email server.Having memorably told Mrs. Clinton in a debate in October that Americans were ""sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,"" he said Sunday: ""Look at the front pages in terms of what Secretary Clinton is getting slapped with.""Mrs. Clinton dismissed the latest controversy over her email as an ""interagency dispute"" that pales next to the larger issues on voters' minds.For all the sparring, both campaigns are also taking pains to put out a positive message. But their core arguments are very different.Mrs. Clinton says that her strength is persevering in the face of setbacks. A biographical video that plays for crowds ahead of her appearances ends with Mrs. Clinton saying, ""I don't quit"" -- a theme of her campaign since it launched last April. She says she has the experience and stamina to both accomplish her goals and beat the Republican nominee this fall.Mr. Sanders is laying out a broader vision of a country that seeks to overturn a political system that favors the richest Americans.He is calling for a bottom-up ""revolution"" that will compel Washington officials to act in the interests of a struggling middle class.A huge rally he held Saturday in the college town of Iowa City captured the campaign's mood.As he finished his remarks, the rock band Vampire Weekend took the stage and invoked an optimistic spirit of America at its best.The band played Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land,"" and were joined by Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, who, together with the crowd sang along: ""From the redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters, this land was made for you and me.""---Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",4/4/16

"Clinton, Sanders Spar Over Who Would Be Stronger in General Election; In final pleas to Wisconsin Democrats, candidates issue similar warning: a vote for the other risks defeat in the fall",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778227115?accountid=12768,"MILWAUKEE--In final pleas to Wisconsin Democrats, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders issued a similar warning: A vote for the other risks defeat in the general-election showdown with Republicans.Campaigning in Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday's primary, both candidates cast themselves as better positioned to win in November.Mrs. Clinton suggested that Mr. Sanders is a gamble--a candidate who is new to the national stage and hasn't endured the scrutiny he would likely face if he were to capture the party nomination.""I think we need a nominee who's been tested and vetted already,"" the former secretary of state said at a Democratic dinner in Milwaukee over the weekend. ""For 25 years they've thrown everything they could at me, but I'm still standing.""Mr. Sanders said the enthusiasm he has generated on the trail is a recipe for keeping the White House in Democratic hands. Citing polls showing him outpacing Mrs. Clinton in head-to-head matchups with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, Mr. Sanders said in his speech at the dinner: ""There is one campaign that has created an enormous amount of excitement and enthusiasm. And that is our campaign.""Anticipating a tough night Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton has dropped in and out of Wisconsin in recent days. With 86 pledged delegates awarded proportionally, the state isn't likely to significantly alter the race's trajectory. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates by 1,243 to 980, with 21 contests remaining in the Democratic nomination fight.For his part, Mr. Sanders has hunkered down in Wisconsin, hoping for his seventh victory in the last eight contests.Polls show Mr. Sanders with a small lead in the state. Wisconsin is favorable terrain for the Vermont senator, as independents--among whom he typically outperforms Mrs. Clinton--are free to vote in the open primary, giving an edge to Mr. Sanders. Exit polls from Wisconsin's 2008 Democratic primary showed that Mrs. Clinton's most loyal supporters, African-Americans, were only 8% of those who voted.""We know it [Wisconsin] is close. We know it's competitive,"" said Mrs. Clinton's senior strategist and pollster, Joel Benenson, on CNN Monday. ""Our goal is to maintain our sizable advantage in pledged delegates.""Clinton aides have been skeptical of her spending too much time in the Badger State, particularly with the delegate-rich New York primary coming April 19. A loss in Mrs. Clinton's adopted home state would be an embarrassment she appears determined to avoid. On Monday, she attended an event with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo celebrating an agreement raising the state's minimum wage in New York City and its suburbs.Mr. Sanders campaigned in Janesville, Wis., where he criticized Mrs. Clinton over her support of free-trade agreements. ""I'm not a candidate who goes to the unions, goes to workers and then leaves and goes to a fundraiser with Wall Street,"" Mr. Sanders said.Seeking to blunt that line of attack, which Mr. Sanders has deployed in the past, Mrs. Clinton in her Milwaukee speech laid out her views on trade, noting she has come out against President Barack Obama's proposed 12-nation deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. ""I opposed it because I couldn't look in the eye of any American workers and say this deal will raise your wages,"" she said.When secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton had a more favorable view of TPP, calling it the ""gold standard"" of trade deals.The candidates found one area of agreement in the run-up to Tuesday: the state's GOP governor, Scott Walker. Mr. Walker angered Democrats and unions by pushing through measures ending most collective bargaining rights for public employees.""If you want to know what kind of president I would be, think about all of the things that Gov. Walker does and I will do exactly the opposite,"" Mr. Sanders said in Milwaukee.Mrs. Clinton said she would use her clout as a Democratic president to help defeat Mr. Walker should he run for re-election in 2018. ""I will have your back against Gov. Walker and the tea party legislature here in Wisconsin,"" she said at the party dinner.The two candidates also agreed Monday to another debate, on April 14 in New York City, ending protracted and sometimes contentious negotiations about when and where they would share a stage again.The Clinton and Sanders campaigns had disagreed on details large and small about the next Democratic match-up. The two campaigns each proposed and rejected several dates before agreeing on a prime-time debate to be hosted by CNN in partnership with NY1 News.The ninth Democratic debate will come five days before New York holds its Democratic primary.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",4/5/16
"New York a Coveted Apple for Sanders, Clinton; A Sanders win would slow Clinton's march to nomination; loss would prove devastating",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777345884?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--A New York primary that once looked like a sure thing for Hillary Clinton looms as a pivotal showdown in the Democratic presidential race, with rival Bernie Sanders hoping to embarrass her in her adopted state with a strong showing that would raise doubts about her electability.Both campaigns see New York as a prize with one of two potential outcomes: A Clinton victory that deprives Mr. Sanders of one of his best remaining chances to cut into her delegate lead, or a Sanders upset that would advance his argument to superdelegates that she is a risky bet in the general election.With 247 delegates up for grabs, New York carries the largest cache of the convention representatives of any state left on the calendar save for California. Mrs. Clinton now leads in pledged delegates by 1,243 to 980. If Mr. Sanders can't come out New York with a heavy majority of the state's delegates, the race effectively would be over, Clinton aides said.""There's very little evidence to date of their ability to win the big, diverse states like New York by the type of margin they would truly need to overcome the delegate edge,"" said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.Mindful of the stakes, each candidate figures to compete ahead of the April 19 contest in New York with an intensity not seen since Iowa and New Hampshire. Though the Wisconsin primary is Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton peeled away from the Badger State for three straight days of campaigning in New York that will culminate Friday with a pair of campaign stops in Syracuse.Related* Trump Rivals Jump on Abortion Comments* Kasich's Case for Staying in the RaceHer campaign rolled out a new 30-second TV spot that will air in New York and her husband on Thursday held several rallies in Manhattan. Earlier in the week, Bill Clinton took part in private meetings with African-American and Hispanic leaders who could help boost turnout in minority neighborhoods that favor Mrs. Clinton.One attendee was Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. In an interview, Mr. Diaz said the meeting with a small group of elected officials and business leaders covered both policy and political strategy. ""They're taking New York state seriously. They're not taking anything for granted,"" he said.Both candidates boast ties to the state that they will highlight in the run-up to the vote. Mrs. Clinton represented New York for eight years in the Senate and owns a home in Chappaqua; Mr. Sanders grew up in the state.At a rally Thursday at the State University of New York at Purchase, in the same county as her home, Mrs. Clinton, said: ""It is so good to be home....Westchester is more than a county to me. It's a community where Bill and Chelsea and I moved back in 1999,"" she said, rattling off some local restaurants she enjoys.At the university event, she had a brief, tense conversation with a Greenpeace activist on the rope line who asked about contributions she's gotten from the fossil fuel industry. Mrs. Clinton, pointing her finger at the woman, said: ""I am so sick, I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about this.""""I was honestly surprised by her reaction today. I wasn't expecting that,"" said 26-year-old Eva Resnick-Day, who said neither she nor Greenpeace has any affiliation with the Sanders campaign.Appearing in Harlem on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton showcased her ties to New York officials. She was accompanied at a stop at a cake shop by Rep. Charlie Rangel, who took aim at Mr. Sanders in a conversation with reporters. He congratulated the Vermont senator on making income inequality a priority.""Now I need some help as to what else he's made a priority,"" Mr. Rangel said.Mr. Rangel has been at the center of several ethics controversies over the years. In 2010 President Barack Obama suggested Mr. Rangel retire ""with dignity"" rather than seek re-election--advice Mr. Rangel didn't take.Mr. Sanders was raised in a 3_ room apartment in Brooklyn and despite having lived in Vermont for decades he has retained his New York accent. His campaign is planning events that will highlight his origins, including trips to his old neighborhood and even the running tracks where he competed as a high school athlete in the 1950s.""It's going to be difficult for us to win in her home state. But that's what we're going to try to do,"" said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders strategist. ""And I do think that if we can find a way to defeat her it would be a gigantic signal that Hillary Clinton is a weak front-runner.""A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday showed Mrs. Clinton beating Mr. Sanders in the state 54% to 42%. Still, the poll offered some hopeful news for the Vermont senator: New Yorkers seem to like him better.A total of 49% had an unfavorable view of Mrs. Clinton, compared with 45% who viewed her favorably. For Mr. Sanders, 54% had a favorable view, versus only 30% who had a negative opinion of him.Unlike some other states, New York holds a closed Democratic primary, meaning independents can't participate. That's not good for Mr. Sanders. ""When he doesn't have the independent voters, it's tougher for him,"" said Bruce Gyory, a Democratic consultant with no ties to either campaign.Mrs. Clinton may also be helped by the preponderance of women voters, he added. In New York statewide Democratic primaries, women typically constitute 56%-58% of the turnout, with big proportions of those highly educated, relatively affluent and middle-aged. In other states, Mr. Gyory noted, Mr. Sanders hasn't performed as well with women in that demographic as he has with younger women.Colleen McCain Nelson and Thomas MacMillan contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Erica Orden",4/5/16
"Wisconsin Voters Challenge Front-Runners; Exit polls show GOP groups swung to Cruz, while Sanders drew on his liberal base",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778524747?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin dealt a setback to the presidential campaign's front-runners, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but for different reasons in each party.Democratic voting patterns mirrored those of many prior contests, with Mrs. Clinton building large margins among African-Americans and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders carrying younger voters, independents and liberals. In a state heavy on liberals and light on minority voters, the voting pool included far more of Mr. Sanders's base voters than traditional Clinton supporters.The Republican story was different: Voting groups that had given only tepid support to Sen. Ted Cruz swung more squarely behind him in Wisconsin, enabling him to overcome Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, for example, had built big margins in prior contests among lower-income voters and those without college degrees. In Wisconsin, Mr. Cruz narrowly won those groups or tied his top rival, according to surveys of voters as they left their polling places.Mr. Trump had carried self-described conservative voters in Michigan, another big Midwestern state, which he won last month. But in Wisconsin, those voters backed Mr. Cruz, exit polls reported by CNN and other media showed.The Wisconsin exit polls suggested that Mr. Trump may have a growing problem with women. He won only 36% of their vote on Tuesday, while Mr. Cruz captured 48%.Mr. Trump's support among women was actually a slight improvement over the results from two other Midwestern states, Michigan and Ohio. But as the GOP field winnows, a 36% share of women would signal a weakness in his support.Mr. Cruz's 48% share of women in Wisconsin suggests that he may be consolidating support among those voters.Republican voters were asked to weigh in on one of the overriding questions of the GOP primary race: What should happen if no candidate wins a majority of delegates before the party's national convention?Under party rules, the only way to clinch the presidential nomination is to win support from more than half of the 2,472 convention delegates. But more than half of Republican voters in Wisconsin--some 56%--said that if no one meets that standard, then the candidate with the most primary votes should claim the nomination, according to exit polls reported by various media.By contrast, some 42% of Wisconsin Republicans endorsed the party's regular procedures and said the convention delegates should pick whomever they think would be the best nominee.Not surprisingly, supporters of Mr. Trump favored the scenario that would best suit their candidate, as did Mr. Cruz's backers. Mr. Trump's supporters were most likely to say that the candidate with the most primary votes should become the nominee, while Mr. Cruz's supporters were more likely to say that a contested convention should be decided by the delegates.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Think Tank: Political Strategists on What to Watch and What's at Stake in Wisconsin* Trump Faces Great Test Against Wisconsin's Conservative Political Network* Trump Loses Some Self-Confidence on Trail* Politics Counts: Trump, Clinton Margins of Victory Have Declined as Race Progresses* Sanders's Cash Keeps FlowingIn the Democratic race, each candidate drew on familiar voting blocs. Mr. Sanders retained his hold on young voters, carrying 81% of those ages 18 to 29, according to exit polls reported by CNN and other media.Mr. Sanders won 71% of independents who cast ballots in the primary while tying Mrs. Clinton among Democratic Party members. He carried 60% of voters who rated themselves ""very liberal.""The party's youngest and most liberal voters, as well as independents, have been pillars of Mr. Sanders's support in prior contests.Mrs. Clinton retained her hold on nonwhite voters, particularly African Americans.Those familiar voting patterns left Mrs. Clinton at a disadvantage. She won 74% of black voters, but they accounted for less than a tenth of the electorate--half the share that African-Americans accounted for in Ohio, the Midwestern state that Mrs. Clinton won last month.Some 84% of voters in Wisconsin's Democratic primary were white, exit polls showed, compared with 74% in Ohio.Some 66% of Wisconsin voters described themselves as liberal, a larger share than in 2008, during the last competitive Democratic primary. That year, only 47% rated themselves liberal. The share of Democratic voters calling themselves moderate or conservative fell from 53% to 32% over eight years. Those changes in the party helped Mr. Sanders.Wisconsin's Democratic electorate on Tuesday was also far more liberal than that of two other Midwestern states that voted recently, Michigan and Ohio. In Michigan, which Mr. Sanders won last month, 57% of voters rated themselves as liberal, while 59% of Democratic voters in Ohio called themselves liberal.Credit: By Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni",4/6/16
Bernie Sanders Notches Victory in Wisconsin Primary; Vermont senator gains further momentum against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton ahead of New York contest,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778511507?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders on Tuesday defeated Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin's Democratic primary, extending his recent string of victories and adding momentum heading into a pivotal showdown in two weeks in New York state.The Associated Press declared the Vermont senator the winner less than an hour after the polls closed. With more than 99% of precincts reporting, Mr. Sanders led Mrs. Clinton 56.5% to 43.1%.Speaking at rally in Wyoming--site of a Saturday Democratic caucus--Mr. Sanders told the audience about his solid victory in Wisconsin, prompting chants of ""Bernie! Bernie!""He thanked voters in Wisconsin and noted his victories have been coming ""with overwhelming, landslide numbers.""Read More on Election 2016* Wisconsin Primary: Live Coverage* Clinton, Sanders Agree to Debate Before New York Primary* Trump's Path to the Nomination NarrowsMrs. Clinton didn't make a public appearance but sent out a tweet congratulating Mr. Sanders. ""To all the voters and volunteers who poured your hearts into this campaign: Forward!"" Mrs. Clinton said.Trailing in pledged convention delegates, Mr. Sanders was hoping a resounding win in Wisconsin would affirm he remains a viable candidate with a chance to wrest the nomination away from Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator and secretary of state. He has now won seven of the past eight nominating contests, his best stretch since the race began.The Sanders camp now hopes party officials known as ""superdelegates"" will see these results and conclude he would be the stronger candidate in the November election. Most superdelegates are now backing Mrs. Clinton, but they are free to change their minds at any point and support someone else.At the same time, Mr. Sanders faces daunting delegate math and also more pointed questions about how he would achieve the sweeping goals he has laid out. As Wisconsin voters cast ballots, some prominent Democrats chided him over a recent interview in which he struggled to explain how he would break up large banks.Heading into the Wisconsin primary, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates by 1,243 to 980. With superdelegates thrown in, her lead stood at 1,712 to 1,011. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.Mr. Sanders has had trouble closing the gap. Democrats award delegates on a proportional basis, making it hard for him to cut into her lead short of blowout victories in big states. Preliminary tallies show he shrank Mrs. Clinton's lead by only 60 delegates after winning six of seven contests before Wisconsin.Polling had shown Mr. Sanders with a small lead in Wisconsin. With its liberal tradition and a format that allows independents to vote in the Democratic primary, the state looked like favorable terrain for Mr. Sanders.Exit polls showed that Mr. Sanders won handily among independents, who comprised more than a quarter of the electorate. Mr. Sanders won 71% of independents; Mrs. Clinton, 28%.Voting patterns from earlier contests held true in Wisconsin. As ever, Mr. Sanders did best with young voters. He won 81% of voters between the ages of 18-29, while Mrs. Clinton won only 17% of that age group.Mr. Sanders won white voters by 58% to 40%. Whites amounted to 84% of the electorate, and African-Americans just 9%--an unfavorable breakdown for a Clinton campaign that relies heavily on minority voters.Clinton aides anticipated a loss and seemed to be focused on New York, which has about three times as many delegates at stake. She campaigned up and down the state last week, and after a quick trip to Wisconsin on Saturday, she left and didn't return. As Wisconsin voters cast ballots, Mrs. Clinton appeared at a town-hall style event in Brooklyn with Chirlane McCray, wife of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.Mrs. Clinton didn't mention Wisconsin, focusing instead on the next contest and a potential November opponent: Republican Donald Trump.""The fellow who's from New York? I wish he'd get out of one of his towers and actually walk the streets,"" Mrs. Clinton said, addressing a crowd at Brooklyn's Medgar Evers College. ""Peddling prejudice and paranoia is not the New York way.""Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.Mr. Sanders hoped Wisconsin would be a sweet coda to a recent spate of victories. He has now shown he can beat Mrs. Clinton head-to-head whether vying for votes or campaign dollars. In March, Mr. Sanders outraised Mrs. Clinton by nearly $15 million .Having moved from a long-shot candidate to a viable threat to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, Mr. Sanders's policy stances have gotten more attention. In an interview with New York's Daily News, members of the editorial board questioned him on how precisely he would break up the large banks that he says pose a grave threat to the economy.Mr. Sanders told the editorial board he didn't know if the Federal Reserve has the authority to break up the banks. He added, ""I think the administration can have it.""Asked later if he was saying the president could ""order"" the breakup, Mr. Sanders said: ""No, I did not say we would order...The president is not a dictator.""Mr. Sanders also said the Treasury secretary would determine if certain banks were ""too big to fail,"" and if that was deemed to be the case, ""they will be broken up.""Mr. Sanders also was asked about a judge's ruling last week that quashed an attempt by federal regulators to label MetLife Inc. ""too big to fail.""He said, ""It's something I have not studied, honestly...""Austan Goolsbee, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration and is a Clinton supporter, tweeted Tuesday: ""The guy seems clueless on his own #1 issue.""Barney Frank, a former Massachusetts congressman and an architect of the Dodd-Frank law imposing stricter financial regulations following the 2008 economic collapse, said the transcript ""just reinforces that he hasn't given much thought to this other than banks are bad."" Mr. Frank also supports Mrs. Clinton.As in other states, Mr. Sanders drew large, enthusiastic crowds in Wisconsin. He spent election day morning in Milwaukee, having breakfast with the state's former lieutenant governor, Barbara Lawton. Later, he flew to Wyoming for his rally in Laramie.Pat Libecki, 60, who works in a bank, said she voted for Mr. Sanders in Wisconsin.""I think we need a change and I liked his answers to the issues that we're having in this country,"" she said.Colleen McCain Nelson and Erica Orden contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/6/16

""We have a choice, a real choice.""The GOP result was a hard-won victory for anti-Trump forces who had seen the Wisconsin primary as their last, best hope to slow the front-runner's momentum toward the Republican nomination.Mr. Trump's campaign issued a defiant statement in response to the outcome, saying Mr. Cruz was a tool of an establishment dead set against him.""Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet,"" the statement said. ""He is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump.""The Texas senator's victory followed one of the rockiest weeks of Mr. Trump's campaign. Trailing in the polls and under concerted attack from Republican leaders in the state, Mr. Trump also weathered a series of controversies over abortion and other issues that threatened to undercut his standing with women voters.Wisconsin will award its 18 at-large delegates to Mr. Cruz as the statewide winner. He's likely to also win a vast majority of the 24 delegates divided among the state's eight congressional districts, though district-by-district results weren't yet available.Mr. Cruz's strong showing will make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to wrap up the 1,237 delegates needed for the GOP nomination before the primary season ends on June 7, when California allocates the largest number of delegates.Next up on the GOP calendar is the April 19 primary in New York, Mr. Trump's home state, where polls show him with a commanding lead of more than 30 percentage points over Mr. Cruz, who in some surveys runs behind Ohio Gov. John Kasich.New York awards 95 delegates, most of which are allotted proportionately by congressional district. Mr. Trump plans to campaign on Long Island on Wednesday.""Trump has more support than anyone else in New York and always had,"" said state assemblyman Bill Nojay of Pittsford, in north-central New York. ""If the vote was held today, we expect he would win every single congressional district.""A week later, a swath of other East Coast states vote--Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Mr. Cruz's best hope is in states further ahead in the calendar--Indiana on May 3 and Nebraska on May 10.Wisconsin--with its GOP electorate dominated by the kind of working-class, white voters who have been drawn to Mr. Trump elsewhere--was long seen as fertile ground for the New York businessman. But it turned into a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment.""We have to stop Trump,"" said Mary Czarra, 65 years old, of Menomonee Falls, who voted for Mr. Cruz even though she preferred Mr. Kasich. ""He insulted our governor, for crying out loud. You can't do that if you're a Republican here.""Read More on Election 2016* Wisconsin Primary: Live Coverage* Clinton, Sanders Agree to Debate Before New York Primary* Trump's Path to the Nomination NarrowsMr. Cruz was endorsed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, still a hero to the state's conservatives even though his 2016 presidential campaign fizzled.Mr. Trump lambasted Mr. Walker and others in the state party establishment who opposed him, and their assault on the front-runner backfired among voters like Jim White, 62, of Milwaukee.""I see the GOP fighting this guy all the way, and I don't like it,"" Mr. White said. ""My feeling is this is about to destroy a lot of people; they won't vote ever again if Trump loses.""Holding out hope for a come-from-behind victory, Mr. Trump spent the past week stumping across the state, even skipping his grandson's bris Sunday to greet voters at a Milwaukee diner.""He cannot downplay the significance of Wisconsin, because he moved here for the final week,"" said Brian Fraley, a Republican operative based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. ""He went to every corner of the state. He was everywhere and he worked it hard, so he can't say that little Wisconsin didn't mean much. If it didn't mean much, he wouldn't be investing time and energy here.""Wisconsin's primary had been seen as a tough test for Mr. Cruz because he has struggled in other Midwestern industrial states including Michigan and Illinois. Most of his victories over Mr. Trump have come in states that hold caucuses--time-consuming events that play to his grass-roots organizational strength. Wisconsin's primary also is open to Democrats and independents, not just registered Republicans.Mr. Trump has done better in open primaries, while Mr. Cruz improves where balloting is limited to the party faithful. But with an equally competitive Democratic race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders for their party's nomination, it was unclear if Mr. Trump could pull away cross-party voters.Before Tuesday, Mr. Trump had 737 delegates, Mr. Cruz had 475. Even if Mr. Cruz ended up winning all 42 delegates from Wisconsin, it was unlikely there are enough bound delegates left for him to reach 1,237 before the convention.For Mr. Trump, locking up the nomination during the primary season is possible but increasingly difficult, raising the chances that Republicans will choose their nominee in Cleveland, in a contested convention.Messrs Cruz and Trump have played down suggestions that another candidate would be nominated if the convention deadlocked, and warned that grass-roots Republicans would rebel if that happened.Mark Meckler, a tea-party activist who hasn't endorsed any candidate, agreed. ""As for the chatter about a contested convention, if neither Cruz nor Trump are the nominee, the Republican Party will end in a fiery crash and Hillary Clinton will be our next president,"" he said. ""Many in the grass-roots movement say they will simply not vote.""The next several primaries are in East Coast states where Republicans are likely to be less receptive to Mr. Cruz's religious, antiestablishment brand of conservatism than they are in Wisconsin.""This is the last state in which Ted Cruz has any ability to win a state through the rest of April, and in some of them, he's going to be fighting for second place,"" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Trump adviser and daughter of former presidential rival Mike Huckabee. ""Moving forward, the momentum will all be on Trump's side.""In the run-up to Wisconsin, a series of controversies damaged his already-shaky standing among women. He admitted it was a mistake to have retweeted an unflattering photo of Mr. Cruz's wife Heidi. And he offered contradictory responses to questions about the sensitive abortion rights issue.He seemed to be trying to lessen the damage by bringing his wife, Melania, onto the campaign trail on the eve of the Wisconsin primary.Yet his mistakes helped Mr. Cruz pick up the endorsement of the National Right to Life Committee, the leading national antiabortion rights group.After a vote Saturday by its board of directors, the group said: ""Sen. Cruz is the only candidate for president who has always been pro-life, who has a 100% pro-life voting record with National Right to Life, who can win the Republican nomination, and who can defeat pro-abortion Hillary Clinton in November.""In an MSNBC interview Tuesday, Mr. Trump denied the week has reflected badly on his support for women. ""As far as women are concerned, nobody respects women more than I do, not even close,"" he said.Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications: Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a Donald Trump campaign adviser and the daughter of former presidential rival Mike Huckabee.

Democratic Superdelegates Pressured to Shift Stance After String of Sanders Wins; Vermont senator's recent victories have left some Democrats defending their decision to back Hillary Clinton at party's convention,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778509200?accountid=12768,"Along with his takeout from the vegan chain Native Foods Café, Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado received this note: ""The constituency has spoken. Use your power wisely. Feel the Bern.""Mr. Polis, a superdelegate who has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, acknowledged the pressure on him to change his position in a state where Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont handily won the Democratic caucuses. ""Even my food takeout is lobbying me for #FeelTheBern,"" Mr. Polis tweeted late last month.Mr. Sanders's recent victories in Colorado, Hawaii, Washington, Alaska and elsewhere have left some other Democrats defending their decision to back Mrs. Clinton at the party's convention in Philadelphia this July.And more could feel the pressure if Mr. Sanders continues to rack up wins. He won the Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, notching his seventh win in the last eight nominating contests. Democratic lawmakers in Wisconsin including Rep. Gwen Moore and Sen. Tammy Baldwin backed Mrs. Clinton. All Democratic members of Congress are superdelegates.Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who backs Mrs. Clinton, said he has had some ""robust conversations"" with constituents after Mr. Sanders won the state's Democratic caucuses on March 26, but doesn't plan to shift his stance.""A lot of my strongest supporters are on both sides of the presidential campaign, but I have no doubt we'll be able to hang together and come back together during the convention,"" Mr. Schatz said Monday, adding a vigorous primary would strengthen the process. ""I am not one of those people who has great heartburn about a contest going all the way to the convention.""As of Monday, Mrs. Clinton was leading the Democratic race in pledged delegates 1,243 to 980. When superdelegates are thrown in, her lead grows: 1,712 to 1,011. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.Mr. Sanders's campaign has said that those superdelegates--party leaders and elected officials free to back whomever they choose--should pay attention to Mr. Sanders's momentum and abandon Mrs. Clinton.""A lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Sanders said on CNN in late March. ""I think their own constituents are going to say to them, hey, why don't you support the people of our state, vote for Sanders?""So far, that doesn't seem to be happening. Mrs. Clinton has the backing of far more congressional lawmakers than Mr. Sanders and none have defected after Sanders victories.""I am supporting Hillary Clinton and I will continue to do that,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and superdelegate, said last week in her home state, whose primary Mr. Sanders won in early February.The Clinton campaign has said that the former secretary of state's victories in primaries demonstrate that more Democratic voters support her than Mr. Sanders, whose wins have largely come in caucus states with fewer participants.""For most of the campaign, Senator Sanders has criticized the role that superdelegates play in the nominating process, but as he now campaigns without a clear path [to] the nomination that relies on the voters, he's aggressively courting their support,"" Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, said in a memo Monday.Superdelegates supporting Mr. Sanders have occasionally found themselves in the reverse situation. Rep. Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was the first member of Congress to endorse Mr. Sanders. Last month, Mrs. Clinton won the Arizona primary. A superdelegate, Mr. Grijalva is still backing Mr. Sanders.Mr. Grijalva said he isn't facing a backlash from his district over his endorsement, though he has questions about the role of superdelegates. While they remain part of the system, however, Mr. Grijalva said he would continue to support Mr. Sanders. ""My resolve is as strong as his, which is to keep going,"" he said.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comCredit: By Kristina Peterson",4/6/16
Bernie Sanders Seeks to Extend Winning Streak With Wisconsin Primary; Rival and front-runner Hillary Clinton appears to be looking ahead to New York's Democratic contest,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778507372?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders on Tuesday looked to extend his recent string of primary victories with a win in Wisconsin, while his rival Hillary Clinton appeared to be looking ahead to the next Democratic contest in New York.The Vermont senator hoped a victory Tuesday would supply fresh momentum heading into the New York contest, on April 19, and that a resounding-enough win might even persuade party officials known as ""superdelegates"" that he would be the stronger general-election candidate. But he faced criticism by some Democrats over a recent interview in which he struggled to explain how he would break up large banks and achieve other parts of his ambitious agenda.Polling had shown Mr. Sanders with a small lead in Wisconsin. With its liberal tradition and a format that allows independents to vote in the Democratic primary, the state looked like favorable terrain for Mr. Sanders.Clinton aides anticipated a loss and seemed to be focused on New York, which she represented in the U.S. Senate and which has about three times as many delegates at stake. She campaigned up and down the state last week, and after a quick trip to Wisconsin on Saturday, she left and didn't return. As Wisconsin voters cast ballots, Mrs. Clinton appeared at a town-hall style event in Brooklyn with Chirlane McCray, wife of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.Read More on Election 2016* Wisconsin Primary: Live Coverage* Clinton, Sanders Agree to Debate Before New York Primary* Trump's Path to the Nomination NarrowsShe didn't mention Wisconsin, focusing instead on the New York primary and a potential future opponent: Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.""The fellow who's from New York? I wish he'd get out of one of his towers and actually walk the streets,"" Mrs. Clinton said, addressing a crowd at Medgar Evers College. ""Peddling prejudice and paranoia is not the New York way.""Mr. Trump's campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.However treacherous the path forward might be, Wisconsin stood to be a sweet coda to what has been Mr. Sanders's most successful stretch since the race began. A victory in Wisconsin would give Mr. Sanders victories in seven of the last eight contests. Though he trails Mrs. Clinton in pledged delegates, he has shown he can still beat her head-to-head whether they are vying for votes or campaign dollars. In March, Mr. Sanders out raised Mrs. Clinton by nearly $15 million.Having moved from a long-shot candidate to a viable threat to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, Mr. Sanders has been facing more pointed questions about how he would achieve the goals he has laid out. In an interview with the New York Daily News, members of the editorial board questioned him on how precisely he would break up the large banks that he says pose a grave threat to the U.S. economy.Mr. Sanders told the newspaper he didn't know if the Federal Reserve has the authority to break up the banks. He added, ""I think the administration can have it.""Asked later if he was saying the president could ""order"" the break up, Mr. Sanders said: ""No, I did not say we would order...The president is not a dictator.""Would the banks break themselves up?, Mr. Sanders was asked.Mr. Sanders said the Treasury secretary would determine if certain banks were ""too big to fail,"" and if that was deemed to be the case, ""they will be broken up.""Mr. Sanders also was asked about a judge's ruling last week that quashed an attempt by federal regulators to label MetLife Inc. ""too big to fail.""He said ""it's something I have not studied, honestly...""Austan Goolsbee, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, tweeted Tuesday : ""The guy seems clueless on his own #1 issue.""Barney Frank, a former Massachusetts congressman and an architect of the Dodd-Frank law imposing stricter financial regulations following the 2008 economic collapse, said the transcript ""just reinforces that he hasn't given much thought to this other than banks are bad.""Both Messrs. Goolsbee and Frank are Clinton supporters.As in other states, Mr. Sanders drew large, enthusiastic crowds in Wisconsin. He spent election day morning in Milwaukee, having breakfast with the state's former lieutenant governor, Barbara Lawton.Menomonee Falls, Wis., resident Pat Libecki, 60, who works in a bank, said she voted for Mr. Sanders.""I think we need a change and I liked his answers to the issues that we're having in this country,"" she said.Heading into the Wisconsin primary, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates, 1,243 to 980. With superdelegates thrown in, her lead stood at 1,712 to Mr. Sanders's 1,011. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.Mr. Sanders has had trouble closing the gap. Democrats award delegates on a proportional basis, making it hard for him to cut into her lead short of blowout victories in large, delegate-rich states.Preliminary tallies show he shrunk Mrs. Clinton's lead by only 60 delegates after winning six of the last seven contests before Wisconsin.Part of Mr. Sanders's argument is that he would be a stronger nominee in the general election matchup in the fall. While most superdelegates are backing Mrs. Clinton, he hopes that if he continues winning primary contests they will begin to abandon her candidacy.David Wasserman, a delegate expert for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, says Mr. Sanders will need to capture 57% of the remaining delegates to erase Mrs. Clinton's lead.Colleen McCain Nelson and Erica Orden contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/6/16

"Bernie Sanders Outlines Plan to Pare Down Big Banks; Proposal gives power to break up banks to Treasury secretary, but lets firms decide how",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778844784?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders's awkward explanation of how he would break up the nation's biggest banks reverberated on the campaign trail Wednesday, with his Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton chiding him for a hazy plan.""He hadn't done his homework and he'd been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn't really studied or understood,"" Mrs. Clinton said on MSNBC Wednesday, a day after Mr. Sanders trounced her in the Wisconsin primary.The Vermont senator's full interview with the New York Daily News, however, shows he offered a clearer vision than the political backlash suggests.Much of the criticism has centered on an exchange in which he was repeatedly questioned about the authority the government could use to pare down the biggest banks. Mr. Sanders said a bill he introduced in May 2015 would give the Treasury secretary authority to break up big banks but leave it up to the institutions to figure out how to restructure.""It is their decision as to what they want to do and how they want to reconfigure themselves,"" Mr. Sanders said during the April 1 interview, which was publicly released on Monday. ""That's not my decision.""Mike Konczal, a fellow at the liberal Roosevelt Institute, who published a blog post on Mr. Sanders's interview , said the confusion stems from a faulty assumption.""When people say, 'We have to break up the banks,' they do not have a specific way to restructure. They in fact have a destination and leave it to the banks to get there,"" he said.Under Mr. Sanders's plan, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, headed by the Treasury secretary, would have 90 days to compile a list of banks deemed to be too-big-to-fail. The list would automatically include institutions like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs, Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley, a point he reiterated during the interview. The firms are among the eight identified as institutions that could pose a threat to the financial stability of the country.After drawing up the list, the Treasury secretary, in consultation with the firm's regulator, would have one year to make sure the banks break themselves up so that a failure wouldn't require a taxpayer bailout to avoid a big blow to the U.S. or global economy.Mr. Sanders's proposal differs from the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law in two significant ways. His plan would give the authority to break up the banks directly to the administration through the Treasury secretary, and it leaves the decision on how to break up the banks to the institutions themselves, not the Federal Reserve.Today, that power rests with the Fed, which can start the breakup process only after a number of triggers.Critics still picked apart Mr. Sanders's plan.Tony Fratto, a partner at consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies, which advises large banks, said the senator's plan essentially was ""moving the authority from one sophisticated economic agency to another sophisticated economic agency.""Under the Dodd-Frank law, banks with $50 billion or more in assets are required to draw up credible bankruptcy plans, or ""living wills."" Failing to write a reliable plan opens the way for regulators to cap the size of the firm or limit its activities.Results of those living wills will serve as a litmus test on whether the Fed will exert that authority. Both the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are assessing which big banks drafted credible plans, and their verdicts are expected to be released soon.""The tools are there,"" said Cornelius Hurley, the director of Boston University's Center for Finance, Law and Policy and a former Fed official. ""They could break them up, but they don't have the willpower.""The banks could also be required to slim down if the FSOC now headed by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, identifies a firm as systemically important. If the council's 10 voting members--mostly heads of regulatory agencies--decide that is the case, a firm is placed under the Fed's supervision, and its size or activities could be limited.But last week's ruling by a federal district judge upending FSOC's designation of MetLife Inc. as ""systemically important"" puts a legal question mark over the council's authority, especially when it comes to big insurers.Notwithstanding the court challenge, the council has power to break up an institution if it decides by a majority vote that the firm presents a ""grave threat"" to financial stability--a power the council has yet to exert.Write to Donna Borak at donna.borak@wsj.comCredit: By Donna Borak",4/7/16
War of Words Escalates in Democratic Race; Sanders says Clinton is unfit to be president and a headline said she said the same about him,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779292234?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--The Democratic race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders detoured Thursday from high-minded debate over issues into a he-said-she-said squabble ahead of the presidential primary fight for New York, a contest with outsize importance to both candidates.For Mr. Sanders, the state is a must-win if he is to have any chance of catching the Democratic front-runner. For Mrs. Clinton, a loss in her adopted home state in the April 19 primary would be deeply embarrassing.Those stakes help explain the sharp exchanges in recent days as both campaigns launched aggressive New York campaigns, including new television ads with messages tailored to different parts of the state.Mr. Sanders charged that Mrs. Clinton wasn't qualified to be president--but only, he said, because she said the same about him. But Mrs. Clinton hadn't called him unqualified; she declined to answer when pressed on the matter in an earlier TV interview.""If Secretary Clinton thinks that just because I'm from a small state in Vermont...they're going to beat us up and...we're not going to fight back...they can guess again,"" he told reporters in Philadelphia on Thursday.Mrs. Clinton called the whole thing ""silly,"" even as her campaign sought to raise money off the claim that the former first lady, senator and secretary of state isn't prepared for the White House. In a second fundraising email Thursday, her campaign emphasized that she never called him unqualified.Later Thursday, in an interview with CBS, Mr. Sanders repeated that he was only making charges against Mrs. Clinton because he believed she leveled them first toward him. He said he will ""certainly"" support her if she's the Democratic nominee, but when asked directly if he believes she is ""unqualified to be president,"" he replied, ""Well, does Secretary Clinton believe that I am unqualified to be president?""Mrs. Clinton has 1,280 pledged delegates, the type awarded by voters, to Mr. Sanders's 1,030. When superdelegates--party leaders who can support anybody they like--are included she has 1,749 to his 1,061. A total of 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.After New York awards 291 delegates, there are just three large states left--California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania--and Mr. Sanders needs to win all four with large margins if he is to have any chance to catch her.Mrs. Clinton, who represented New York for eight years in the Senate and still calls the state home, begins with some clear advantages. New York primaries bar independent voters, who typically favor Mr. Sanders. And the electorate is expected to be about a third nonwhite, a group that has voted for Mrs. Clinton in previous contests.Recent public polling shows Mrs. Clinton with about a 10-point lead, but Mr. Sanders has shown he can catch up as voting approaches and more people get to know him.""Everybody in New York knows who Hillary Clinton is, so if you're undecided about her, then you probably don't want to vote for her,"" said Bill Cunningham, a political consultant who is unaffiliated with either campaign.Each side has tailored one campaign for the New York metropolitan area, which could account for as much as 70% of the electorate, and another for the rest of New York, known as upstate.On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton rode the subway alongside Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and began airing five television ads. ""I am so proud to have represented this state for eight years. I'm a proud New Yorker,"" she said before boarding the subway.Mrs. Clinton's New York City strategy centers on increasing turnout among black and Hispanic voters. On Sunday, she visited three African-American churches in Brooklyn, where she spoke about the importance of tackling ""systemic racism"" and the need for gun restrictions.On Tuesday, she held an event in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn that focused on African-American women, and included a panel featuring Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner. Mr. Garner, an African-American, died in 2014 after being held in an apparent police chokehold on Staten Island while unarmed. His death sparked a protests and political turmoil in New York.One of three Clinton ads airing in the New York metro area is narrated by actor Morgan Freeman and is focused on victims of police violence and on her relationship with President Barack Obama. A second ad celebrates New York's diversity and hits Republican Donald Trump for his comments about Muslims and plans to build a wall along the Mexican border, another spot meant to motivate minority voters.Upstate, her events and TV ads focus on her work to boost economic development when she was in the Senate, including advocating for the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and its thousands of high-tech jobs. On Friday, she will travel to Buffalo for an economic round table, and campaign in Rochester.Mr. Sanders, a Brooklyn native, is emphasizing his own New York roots. He pushed for a debate in Brooklyn, scheduled for next week. He drew 18,000 people to a rally in the Bronx last week and plans a large rally in Manhattan's Washington Square Park next week. Aides also note that eastern upstate New York borders Vermont, so people there have heard about him for years.In a New York City metro area that is home to some of the richest and the poorest Americans, Mr. Sanders will focus on income inequality, and on Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street, said Tad Devine, his senior strategist.The Sanders campaign is airing a TV spot featuring Erica Garner, Mr. Garner's daughter.One Sanders advantage is support of the Working Families Party, the state's minor but powerful leftist party. ""They are very good at grass roots ground game,"" said Steve Greenberg, a New York polling expert.Thursday's tiff over whether Mrs. Clinton is qualified or not began when the New York Daily News published an interview with Mr. Sanders. The Clinton campaign circulated the entire transcript and on Wednesday.Mrs. Clinton was asked three times on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" whether, in light of the interview, she thinks he is qualified to be president.""I think the interview raised a lot of really serious questions,"" she said. ""I will leave it to voters to decide who of us can do the job that the country needs.""The Washington Post, writing about the interview, included a headline that said she had questioned whether he was qualified. Mr. Sanders seized on that.""When you have headlines in the Washington Post--quote 'Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president,' my response is, well you know, if you want to question my qualifications let me suggest this, then maybe the American people might wonder about your qualifications, Madam Secretary,"" he said Thursday.He suggested her past support for trade agreements, her vote to authorize the Iraq war and support from Wall Street interests disqualified her for the job.Asked about his comments on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton told reporters in New York City, ""Well it's kind of a silly thing to say. But I'm going to trust the voters of New York who know me and have voted for me three times.""Mrs. Clinton needs to drive up her support among women, particularly suburban women, a campaign adviser said. Mr. Sanders's comment could help with that, said George Arzt, a New York City Democratic political consultant who is unaffiliated in the race.""I think there are many people who view Hillary--whether they like her or not--as the most experienced and qualified in the field,"" he said. ""There are many women who believe that the 'unqualified' title has been used too often against women looking for better jobs.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Erica Orden",4/8/16

Big animals get wounded and come back. The question is whether he's a big animal or something smaller that skittered around the forest and finally picked the wrong fight.Wisconsin almost certainly foreclosed his chance to walk into Cleveland with enough delegates to win on the first ballot. The convention will be open, and contested.There's nothing easy about Mr. Trump. He leaves his supporters' hearts in their mouths. He leaves his enemies happy then self-doubting, triumphant then fatalistic. But what we have witnessed the past few weeks is his deflation, a real one, and the worst kind: It was all his fault. It wasn't the anti-Trump forces and it wasn't Ted Cruz, it was his lax, louche indiscipline.But now we cut to New York. We are about to witness something of a Trump reinflation.The other night he drew some 10,000 people to a rally in Bethpage, Long Island, which the Daily News called ""riotous"" and Newsday called ""rousing."" I lived in Long Island from age 5 to 16 and go there often. My friends and their children are a generation or two from Brooklyn and Queens, and Brooklyn and Queens were one or two generations from the old country. Long Islanders carry within them, still and more than they know, a love for America tinged by family lore of the immigrant experience--an old and patriotic sense that gets mixed up, in the current way, with a nationalistic sense. Republicans who were amusing themselves on social media the night of the rally--as word spread of turnout they were sending out pictures of Joey Buttafuoco--look down on those rally-goers at their peril. They will be part of the base of whatever takes the place of the current Republican Party.Mr. Trump, in the video I saw, was masterly. ""We don't win anymore,"" he said. ""We don't fight like people from Long Island. We don't fight like people from New York."" He laid into Mr. Cruz: ""Remember when he started lecturing me on 'New York values' like we're no good?"" That was the authentic sound of working New York: ""Like we're no good.""And it felt fresh, because no one really campaigns for the presidency in New York anymore. Its primaries are in April, usually after everything's been settled. In the general election New York's in the bag for the Democrats, so why should they expend the energy or Republicans the time?Candidates for president only come here for major media interviews and for money. They pick Manhattan up and shake it like a big pink piggy bank--$60K at the downtown breakfast, $600K at the uptown cocktail party. They enter the homes of the great and powerful--the spacious rooms, high ceilings, plump sofas, shiny floors, important art, views of Central Park--and they think: ""Boy, they sure got it good. Maybe the economy isn't so bad!""The rich of New York thus hold an outsized place in the Republican and Democratic imagination. But the not-rich--the middle, the hanging-on and the poor--have no place at all.Republicans especially, the past 20 or so years, have no sense of them. They know the hedge-funders and the rooms with the Rothkos. Their vision of everything else comes from old movies like ""Dog Day Afternoon."" They're surprised we're not all running around in the streets shouting ""Attica! Attica!""What Republicans especially fail to appreciate is that New York more than ever is full of legal immigrants. If you sit on the side of a street fair in non-hipster Brooklyn--in Bay Ridge, for instance--you'll see all the world passing by: people from China, Ireland, Lebanon, Poland, South and Central America, Asia, Africa, Arabia. They are young. They're expending all their energy doing what people do to establish themselves--finding the job, keeping it, paying the rent, finding someone to love, making a family, making it all work.So far they have no time for politics--but they will. They're not aligned--but they will be. They are open to persuasion. They will consider your argument. All you have to do is be there and talk to them. If the Republican Party were thinking long-term, it would. Maybe when the party is reconstituting itself--trying to rebuild a damaged or destroyed party, or inventing a new one--they'll recognize these people too as a potential part of their base.In any case Mr. Trump is expected to win big. He's 31 points ahead in the polls. Is there any chance he can discipline himself and sustain the discipline, create a real campaign, professionalize his operation? Would it make a difference? Or are his reputation and his mess set so firmly in concrete nothing can change his outcome?On the Democratic side Bernie Sanders has turned tough. He seems to have come face to face with the fact that he really wants to win. He said Hillary Clinton is not ""qualified"" to be president because of her support for the Iraq War, ""disastrous"" trade policies, and taking Wall Street money. His campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, upped the ante by saying if Mrs. Clinton hits back unfairly, ""they're going to see how a real New Yorker fights back.""God bless New York for stripping the passive from the passive-aggressive campaign they were waging against each other until this week.I saw Mrs. Clinton at Harlem's Apollo Theater last week. The audience was appropriately enthusiastic but not wild. Soon after, I watched the Sanders rally in the Bronx--a crowd of at least 15,000 that was wild. A Hillary supporter I spoke to at the Apollo confessed she was there to reignite her excitement. In her life she was surrounded by Bernie supporters. It leaves you feeling defensive.If he dings her bad or wins in New York it will be a real setback for Mrs. Clinton, and an embarrassment.Everything on both sides is still so in play.Washington Republicans continue their fantasy of the white knight who comes to Cleveland and saves the day--the magical unifying figure who electrifies the convention and wins on the fourth ballot. But how would the large majority of Republicans who've voted for Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz feel about that? Not good!Again, if Mr. Trump wins, a significant part of the party splits off. If he doesn't, a significant part of the party likely isn't there in November. I was asked this week if Trump always intended to break the party. I don't think so; I think he set out to win. But whether he wins or not he has succeeded in demonstrating to the party that it is and was broken. He made the information unavoidable.A friend with whom I'd been discussing the convention, a former Romney bundler, this week sent me a gift: handsome two-inch heels, heavily padded on the sole so if there is trouble you could run in them. The outside fabric is rough camouflage, the kind a soldier would wear in the field.That's a fellow whose fantasy of what the convention will be like is probably closer to the mark.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",4/8/16
Unqualified vs. Un-Democratic; Danger: Clinton and Sanders contents under pressure.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779283693?accountid=12768,"The pillow fight that has been the Democratic nomination contest took a savage turn this week, as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders traded up for water balloons. Their little scuffle probably won't leave any marks, but it sure is entertaining.The former first lady apparently had enough after losing seven of the last eight primaries, and she lashed out at an activist on a rope line that ""I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me."" She told Politico in a passive-aggressive interview that the Vermont socialist is ""a relatively new Democrat, and, in fact, I'm not even sure he is one."" On MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Mrs. Clinton even said she had ""a lot of questions"" about whether ""this guy is ready to be President of the United States?""Mr. Sanders stopped being polite and started getting real, or at least snippy. ""Well, let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton: I don't believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super Pac, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds,"" he said in Philadelphia. ""I don't think you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super Pac."" Oh dear.If such umbrage-taking is what passes for negativity between Democrats, perhaps these scamps would benefit from a time-out. The truth is that Mrs. Clinton has moved so far left to accommodate Mr. Sanders's revolution that there are few policy differences to litigate. She'll move to single-payer health care a bit slower, create free college through loan forgiveness rather than a huge tax increase, and so forth. Since Mr. Sanders won't talk about Mrs. Clinton's emails, they're left with the non-drama of minor insults.",4/8/16
Trump and Sanders Rallies Highlight a Political Odd Couple; Events for Trump and Sanders show how different the two populist candidates really are,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779283278?accountid=12768,"ONALASKA, Wis.--The 2016 presidential campaign has unfolded as the year of the angry, disillusioned voter. Many analysts see this dynamic on both sides of the aisle, inviting odd-couple comparisons between Republican Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.Both men are defying their party's establishment, delivering populist messages, and drawing unusually large and passionate crowds of people upset with the status quo. Exit polls in Wisconsin's primary on Tuesday showed they both drew heavily from voters who want the country to take a less active role in world affairs and who are worried about trade taking U.S. jobs away.Mr. Sanders himself invited one point of comparison between himself and the celebrity New York businessman recently by invoking a signature Trumpism: He bragged about the ""YUUUUUGE"" crowds he has been drawing.But that's just about where the similarity ends, if a visit to recent rallies held by the two candidates in Wisconsin is any indication.Traveling from a Trump rally in Janesville, Wis., to a Sanders event here in Onalaska was like a trip from Venus to Mars, and the contrast helps illustrate the vast difference in the political forces that their expectation-defying campaigns are unleashing.Ask Sanders supporters what brought them to the rally and their first word was likely to be ""Bernie."" There is a real personal draw for Sanders supporters.And while there are things they are very angry about--the upper-income 1%, the corrupt campaign-finance system, Democratic Party bosses--they look to their candidate with hope.""I'm pretty excited about his ideas,"" said Gloria Kelbel, a 53-year-old high-school counselor from Hillsboro, Wis., who said the Onalaska event was the first political rally she had ever attended.Ask Trump supporters why they braved long lines and often drove long distances to be there, they were likely to talk about the troubling state of the world and the political system. They are angry both at the elites who ignore them and the underclass that is displacing them.""I want someone who gives a damn about the American worker,"" said Shawn Rickelman, 31, an unemployed trucker from Rockford, Ill.Both rallies saw thousands of people thronging large venues and waiting for hours for the main event. But there were chairs for the Trump crowd; people stood for Sanders. As a result, the biggest hazard at the Sanders rally was heat exhaustion. Two people needed medical attention. At the Trump rally, the hazard was outside, among the dueling protest groups: One anti-Trump protester got pepper-sprayed.The long wait for the candidates was filled with emblematic soundtracks. While Mr. Sanders played revolution-themed rock and folk, Mr. Trump's playlist was, like him, idiosyncratic, ranging from the Rolling Stones (""You Can't Always Get What You Want"") to Elton John (""Tiny Dancer"") to opera (""Nessun Dorma"" from act 3 of Puccini's ""Turandot"").Mr. Sanders delivered a stump speech that was so familiar when he asked who knew what the average contribution to the campaign was, many people did and shouted back ""$27!"" in unison. The topics they applauded, including decriminalizing marijuana and opposition to fracking, would never be cheered for at a Trump rally.Mr. Trump is famously unscripted, so no one ever knows for sure what will come out of his mouth--or out of the mouths of his supporters.Reading his audience like the skilled entertainer he is, Mr. Trump was able to rouse the previously calm Wisconsin audience into a jeering crowd at the mention of illegal immigrants. And to Mr. Trump's own surprise, the crowd booed the mention of a local GOP luminary, House Speaker Paul Ryan. Some called Mr. Ryan ""RINO,"" the conservative label for ""Republicans in Name Only.""Among all the differences, the two Wisconsin rallies did, however, identify one common enemy: Both Trump supporters and Sanders supporters booed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is a foe of the state's labor unions and endorsed Mr. Trump's GOP rival, Sen. Ted Cruz.Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.comCredit: By Janet Hook",4/8/16
War of Words Escalates in Democratic Race; Sanders says Clinton is unfit to be president and a headline said she said the same about him,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779283135?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--The Democratic race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders detoured Thursday from high-minded debate over issues into a he-said-she-said squabble ahead of the presidential primary fight for New York, a contest with outsize importance to both candidates.For Mr. Sanders, the state is a must-win if he is to have any chance of catching the Democratic front-runner. For Mrs. Clinton, a loss in her adopted home state in the April 19 primary would be deeply embarrassing.Those stakes help explain the sharp exchanges in recent days as both campaigns launched aggressive New York campaigns, including new television ads with messages tailored to different parts of the state.Mr. Sanders charged that Mrs. Clinton wasn't qualified to be president--but only, he said, because she said the same about him. But Mrs. Clinton hadn't called him unqualified; she declined to answer when pressed on the matter in an earlier TV interview.""If Secretary Clinton thinks that just because I'm from a small state in Vermont...they're going to beat us up and...we're not going to fight back...they can guess again,"" he told reporters in Philadelphia on Thursday.Mrs. Clinton called the whole thing ""silly,"" even as her campaign sought to raise money off the claim that the former first lady, senator and secretary of state isn't prepared for the White House.Mrs. Clinton has 1,280 pledged delegates, the type awarded by voters, to Mr. Sanders's 1,030. When superdelegates--party leaders who can support anybody they like--are included she has 1,749 to his 1,061. A total of 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.After New York awards 291 delegates, there are just three large states left--California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania--and Mr. Sanders needs to win all four with large margins if he is to have any chance to catch her.Mrs. Clinton, who represented New York for eight years in the Senate and still calls the state home, begins with some clear advantages. New York primaries bar independent voters, who typically favor Mr. Sanders. And the electorate is expected to be about a third nonwhite, a group that has voted for Mrs. Clinton in previous contests.Recent public polling shows Mrs. Clinton with about a 10-point lead, but Mr. Sanders has shown he can catch up as voting approaches and more people get to know him.""Everybody in New York knows who Hillary Clinton is, so if you're undecided about her, then you probably don't want to vote for her,"" said Bill Cunningham, a political consultant who is unaffiliated with either campaign.Each side has tailored one campaign for the New York metropolitan area, which could account for as much as 70% of the electorate, and another for the rest of New York, known as upstate.On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton rode the subway alongside Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and began airing five television ads. ""I am so proud to have represented this state for eight years. I'm a proud New Yorker,"" she said before boarding the subway.Mrs. Clinton's New York City strategy centers on increasing turnout among black and Hispanic voters. On Sunday, she visited three African-American churches in Brooklyn, where she spoke about the importance of tackling ""systemic racism"" and the need for gun restrictions.On Tuesday, she held an event in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn that focused on African-American women, and included a panel featuring Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner. Mr. Garner, an African-American, died in 2014 after being held in an apparent police chokehold on Staten Island while unarmed. His death sparked a protests and political turmoil in New York.One of three Clinton ads airing in the New York metro area is narrated by actor Morgan Freeman and is focused on victims of police violence and on her relationship with President Barack Obama. A second ad celebrates New York's diversity and hits Republican Donald Trump for his comments about Muslims and plans to build a wall along the Mexican border, another spot meant to motivate minority voters.Upstate, her events and TV ads focus on her work to boost economic development when she was in the Senate, including advocating for the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and its thousands of high-tech jobs. On Friday, she will travel to Buffalo for an economic round table, and campaign in Rochester.Mr. Sanders, a Brooklyn native, is emphasizing his own New York roots. He pushed for a debate in Brooklyn, scheduled for next week. He drew 18,000 people to a rally in the Bronx last week and plans a large rally in Manhattan's Washington Square Park next week. Aides also note that eastern upstate New York borders Vermont, so people there have heard about him for years.In a New York City metro area that is home to some of the richest and the poorest Americans, Mr. Sanders will focus on income inequality, and on Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street, said Tad Devine, his senior strategist.The Sanders campaign is airing a TV spot featuring Erica Garner, Mr. Garner's daughter.One Sanders advantage is support of the Working Families Party, the state's minor but powerful leftist party. ""They are very good at grass roots ground game,"" said Steve Greenberg, a New York polling expert.Thursday's tiff over whether Mrs. Clinton is qualified or not began when the New York Daily News published an interview with Mr. Sanders. The Clinton campaign circulated the entire transcript and on Wednesday.Mrs. Clinton was asked three times on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" whether, in light of the interview, she thinks he is qualified to be president.""I think the interview raised a lot of really serious questions,"" she said. ""I will leave it to voters to decide who of us can do the job that the country needs.""The Washington Post, writing about the interview, included a headline that said she had questioned whether he was qualified. Mr. Sanders seized on that.""When you have headlines in the Washington Post--quote 'Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president,' my response is, well you know, if you want to question my qualifications let me suggest this, then maybe the American people might wonder about your qualifications, Madam Secretary,"" he said Thursday.He suggested her past support for trade agreements, her vote to authorize the Iraq war and support from Wall Street interests disqualified her for the job.Asked about his comments on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton told reporters in New York City, ""Well it's kind of a silly thing to say. But I'm going to trust the voters of New York who know me and have voted for me three times.""Mrs. Clinton needs to drive up her support among women, particularly suburban women, a campaign adviser said. Mr. Sanders's comment could help with that, said George Arzt, a New York City Democratic political consultant who is unaffiliated in the race.""I think there are many people who view Hillary--whether they like her or not--as the most experienced and qualified in the field,"" he said. ""There are many women who believe that the 'unqualified' title has been used too often against women looking for better jobs.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Erica Orden",4/8/16
Panama Bernie; Bernie Sanders's politics produced the Panama Papers.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778847727?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders caused the Panama Papers . Bernie of Vermont didn't do it by himself, of course. The world's most famous socialist, and Hillary Clinton's albatross, had a lot of help. Spare me the crocodile tears over the immorality of tax avoidance. Panama is an indictment of government greed.After World War II, the governments of the West established tax regimes to support the reconstruction of their nations. Six decades later, that tax machinery, which runs the social-welfare states in the countries Bernie Sanders cites in every campaign stop as a model for America, has run totally amok--an unaccountable, devouring monster. Billionaires aren't the only ones who run from it.Most governments, including ours, overtax their citizens to feed their own insatiable need for money. Then the legal thieves running the government and their cronies, unwilling to abide the tax levels they created, move their wealth offshore to places like Panama. Arguably, all the world's people should be able to move their assets ""offshore"" to escape governments that are smothering economic life and growth, which has stalled in the U.S., Europe and Asia.Speaking of crocodile tears, Barack Obama spent Tuesday bragging that corporate tax inversions are akin to Panama Papers' tax avoidance. Mr. Obama said ""corporations,"" another swearword invoked by Bernie Sanders at every stop, are ""gaming the system.""Well what about that ""system?"" Mr. Obama is saying, with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in his echo chamber, that U.S. corporations should suck it up on the U.S.'s 35% corporate tax rate, the developed world's highest, and simply send that money to him. Why? Because he's gotta have it. To spend.Other than their national health-care systems, many of which are effectively bankrupt, most Europeans would be hard put to explain what it is their high-tax governments actually do with their money.Suppressed for generations by high tax rates and regulatory minutiae, most Europeans survive in an economic half-life of gray and black markets, with their assets protected by cash-only transactions, bartering, and endless hours devising off-the-books deals involving family real estate, inflated art prices and anything else they can hide from the taxman. The Beatles actually wrote a song about it in 1966--""Taxman,"" a grim ode to all this.Governments with unsated ""needs"" for revenue exist in Europe, Africa, Russia and South America. The Associated Press this week reported that in Russia today shell companies exist simply to pay the bribes that are the price of daily life.One way or another, most people living in the countries run on the Obama-Sanders-Clinton model eventually go searching for their own private Panama. When private capital is under public assault, it will hide. From the wealthiest to the poorest, it creates a world of chiselers, not productive citizens.Sen. Sanders gave his Wisconsin victory speech in Laramie, Wyo., backgrounded by the smiling, bobbing heads of his 20-something voter base. In Western Europe, which is Sanders Land, those 20-somethings are the subject of a permanent economic discipline called high youth unemployment.The Sanders campaign isn't about idealism. It's about the misallocation of capital. ""Misallocation of capital"" is a phrase utterly alien to socialists, and increasingly to most of the modern Democratic Party.In the now-extinct Democratic Party--the party of Hubert Humphrey, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton--room existed for the private sector to breathe. Not yet unhinged completely from economics, Democrats understood the symbiosis between healthy private production and public revenues. Both Presidents Carter and Clinton deregulated economic life.No longer. The deconstructed party of Barack Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and forced-recruit Hillary Clinton says: Just keep squeezing them.This week marked a historic moment in the Democratic drift toward low-growth Euro-socialism. Both California and New York raised the minimum wage to $15. California Gov. Jerry Brown, who in his career has been every Democrat that ever was, summarized the true meaning of the new party. ""Economically, minimum wages may not make sense,"" he said, but they make sense ""morally, socially and politically.""It has been my view for some time that to help her navigate Bernie's new Democratic world Hillary Clinton should bring in Lady Gaga as a consultant. An expert in magic realism.Sen. Sanders is getting mocked now by Hillary Clinton and her supporters for a catastrophic interview he gave this week to the New York Daily News, revealing he knows little about his own proposals. But France's Socialist President François Hollande knew everything about his economic proposals. What difference does it make?The day before losing to Bernie Sanders in Wisconsin, Mrs. Clinton argued: ""I think we need a nominee who's been tested and vetted already. For 25 years they've thrown everything they could at me, but I'm still standing.""Tested, vetted and still standing. On the available evidence so far, that isn't this year's criteria for the American presidency.Write to henninger@wsj.comCredit: By Daniel Henninger",4/8/16
Election 2016: Sanders Has Big Lead in New Hampshire --- Neither Democrat gets Iowa bounce in poll; millennials power Vermont senator,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762622730?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has a commanding and stable lead over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's Democratic primary, enjoying a 20-point edge that budged little after Iowa's closely contested caucuses, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds.Powered by lopsided support among millennials, Mr. Sanders is the first choice of 58% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, compared with 38% who favored Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state.That is about the same as the 57%-38% lead Mr. Sanders had in a Journal/NBC/Marist poll taken in New Hampshire last week, before the two candidates fought to a near draw Monday in Iowa's caucuses.The latest poll, conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, suggests that neither candidate gained any bounce from the results in Iowa, where Mrs. Clinton won by a fraction of a percentage point. Mr. Sanders portrayed the near-tie as a victory for his underdog campaign.The New Hampshire survey illustrates the huge advantage Mr. Sanders enjoys in the state that neighbors his Vermont home. A looming question is whether a victory in the Granite State would be Mr. Sanders' high-water mark, never to be matched again, or a springboard to gains in less-hospitable states that follow.The two states that hold Democratic nominating contests after New Hampshire -- in South Carolina and Nevada on Feb. 20 -- include far larger shares of minority voters, who in opinion surveys support Mrs. Clinton by large margins.""So far in New Hampshire, it's all Sanders, as Clinton faces an uphill fight,"" said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion.The poll found that Mr. Sanders leads Mrs. Clinton among almost all key voting groups in New Hampshire, especially the young. Among likely voters under age 30, Mr. Sanders is supported by 76%, while Mrs. Clinton has 24%.Mr. Sanders leads even among young women, a cornerstone of the coalition Mrs. Clinton is seeking to build. He has support from 64% of women under age 45, while Mrs. Clinton has 35%. Among women over 45, Mrs. Clinton leads by nine points.Interest in the Democratic primary is growing among independents. Asked which primary they would vote in, 42% said the Democratic election and 40% said the Republican race. A month ago, in a Jan. 10 poll, only 32% said Democratic and 47% said Republican.Independents are especially important in New Hampshire, because voters with no party affiliation can decide on Election Day to participate in either party's primary.Among independents who say they are likely to vote in the Democratic primary, Mr. Sanders leads 69% to 26%. Among primary voters who identify themselves as Democrats, his lead is narrower, 51% to 46%.Mrs. Clinton's backers have said Mr. Sanders is likely to win New Hampshire and hope to keep her margin of defeat to single digits. The Clinton camp banks on a much stronger finish in South Carolina, where the electorate is more diverse and the large share of African-American voters likely gives her an advantage.Among the Democratic primary voters in the New Hampshire poll, less than 1% were black and 1% were Latino.There aren't a lot of fence-sitters left for the candidates to persuade in New Hampshire, the poll found. Among those who say they are likely to vote in the Democratic primary, only 3% are undecided, and 6% say they might change their mind about their candidate preference.Overall, 79% of likely Democratic primary voters with a candidate preference said they strongly supported their choices. Among those who prefer Mrs. Clinton, 80% say they strongly support her; among Sanders backers, 77% express that high level of support.As the contest between the two Democratic candidates grows more contentious, several Democratic voters said Thursday that the more combative nature of the race in recent days had solidified their support of Mr. Sanders.""Bernie is doing a great job of differentiating himself as Hillary tries to sort of march into his territory and claim the progressive mantle,"" said David Whitten, 48, a stay-at-home dad who lives outside Portland, Maine. ""I thought it was inevitable it would get a little rough,"" he said before a get-out-the-vote rally in Rochester, N.H., for Mr. Sanders.The Democratic contenders tested their messages Wednesday night in a CNN forum. They didn't share the stage, but an escalating debate between them about Mrs. Clinton's credentials as a liberal played out during their separate appearances.Mr. Sanders pointed to past statements by Mrs. Clinton saying that she was a moderate. ""Some of my best friends are moderates,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""But you can't be a moderate and a progressive. They are different.""Mrs. Clinton questioned how her opponent had become the gatekeeper determining who counts as progressive. Using Mr. Sanders's definition, ""Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive,"" she said.""So I'm not going to let that bother me,"" Mrs. Clinton added. ""I know where I stand.""The Journal/NBC/Marist survey included 567 likely Democratic voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.Credit: By Janet Hook",4/8/16
"Clinton, Sanders Collide At Debate",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762622704?accountid=12768,"DURHAM, N.H. -- The Democratic presidential candidates clashed Thursday night over who is the true progressive at their first one-on-one debate, with Hillary Clinton saying Sen. Bernie Sanders has put forward an unrealistic agenda that would ultimately collapse.Mrs. Clinton spent much of the first hour defending her record, ideologically and in practice, after Mr. Sanders attacked her links to financial firms. ""What being part of the establishment is, is in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street,"" he said.She termed Mr. Sanders's ""insinuation"" that Wall Street donations would keep her from adequately policing the industry an ""artful smear.""A combative tone was set early on when Mrs. Clinton pushed back on Mr. Sanders's claim that she isn't a true ""progressive.""""I'm not making promises that I cannot keep,"" Mrs. Clinton said, drawing a distinction between her self-described ability to get things done and Mr. Sanders's campaign proposals with numbers that she said ""just don't add up.""The Vermont senator said Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, has at times described herself as a ""moderate"" who has a more incremental approach to solving economic problems that require bold action.The candidates sparred over health care, the financial struggles of middle class families and the influence of Wall Street political donations.The debate came five days before the primary in New Hampshire, where a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll shows Mr. Sanders maintains a comfortable lead. The fifth Democratic debate didn't include former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who dropped out of the race Monday after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses.Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, wrote in a stream of tweets on Wednesday that a genuine progressive wouldn't take millions of dollars in Wall Street donations, as Mrs. Clinton has done.In the debate, he noted that in a campaign event last fall in Ohio, Mrs. Clinton said that ""I plead guilty"" to ""being kind of moderate and center.""Mrs. Clinton chided him for ""cherry-picking"" quotes she had given, noting that more often she says she is a progressive who wants to get things done. She also accused Mr. Sanders of being the ""self-proclaimed gatekeeper of progressivism."" She said few Democrats would meet the standard he has set, including President Barack Obama who, she noted, also accepted campaign money from Wall Street.She also said that under Mr. Sanders's definition, Vice President Joe Biden wouldn't be considered a progressive. His support for the Keystone XL pipeline would disqualify him, she indicated -- a statement that appeared at odds with what is known about the vice president's views.The Obama administration rejected the pipeline last year, and as early as 2013, Mr. Biden reportedly told a supporter he opposed Keystone.During the debate, a Clinton campaign aide said she misspoke in citing Keystone as the example for Mr. Biden. He would fail the progressive test, her campaign said, because he supports the Asian free-trade agreement and the death penalty.After weeks in which Mr. Sanders has suggested that Mrs. Clinton is compromised because of Wall Street contributions and speaking fees, Mrs. Clinton hit back hard. ""Enough is enough. If you've got something to say, say it directly,"" she said.She added that she is proud of the job she's done representing her constituents as a former New York senator. ""I think it's time to end a very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks,"" she said.Mr. Sanders replied by speaking in general of contributions from pharmaceutical companies and oil companies, saying they get their way in Congress because of their donations. But he didn't cite anything in Mrs. Clinton's record.""There is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system,"" he said. ""It is undermining American democracy.""Mrs. Clinton countered by noting she's the one who is being attacked by special interests, in the past and during this campaign, and that she's introduced a comprehensive plan to change the way campaigns are financed. ""Today you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove who are running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you,"" she said.One of the lingering questions in the race is whether Mrs. Clinton will face legal trouble stemming from an FBI investigation into her use of a private email system when she served as secretary of state.Asked if she could reassure Democrats that no bombshell revelations were coming, she said yes, dismissing the entire exercise as partisan.""Before it was emails, it was Benghazi,"" she says. ""I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever,"" noting that the government earlier on Thursday also accused former Secretary of State Colin Powell of receiving classified emails on a personal email account.She added that she is ""100% confident"" that nothing would come of the FBI's investigation into her emails.Mr. Sanders was also asked about Mrs. Clinton's emails, but refused to be drawn into an attack. He said there is a ""process under way"" and that he ""will not politicize it."" He added that ""not a day goes by"" when he's not asked to attack her on the email issue, and said he has declined.On foreign policy, Mrs. Clinton was comfortable positioning herself to the right of Mr. Sanders. She cast him as naive for suggesting the U.S. should move aggressively toward normalizing relations with Iran.""If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior,"" she said. ""The president doesn't think we should. I certainly don't think we should.""Mr. Sanders pushed back, saying he doesn't support normalizing relations immediately but would like to work toward that goal. ""Please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We don't,"" he said. ""But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully someday that will happen.""Noting her experience on the world stage, Mrs. Clinton pointed to a statement from a number of national-security experts that raised concerns about her rival's understanding of foreign affairs. ""I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief,"" she said.---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas, Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",4/8/16
Bernie's Big (Last?) Moment,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762621960?accountid=12768,"Claremont, N.H. -- You can hear the whooping from the front door of the city opera house. Two stories up, on Tuesday night, an enormous crowd is packed in to hear Bernie Sanders at his first big event after the Iowa caucuses.It feels like a tent revival meeting. Bernie is keying up his crowd. Every time he brings up the banks, or ""special interests,"" or the ""billionaire class,"" someone in the audience pipes up with a rejoinder, followed by a roar from the crowd. ""You ever heard of Goldman Sachs?"" deadpans the Vermont senator. A voice shouts, ""Hillary has! She goes there!"" The masses scream: ""BOOOOO!!!"" The audience is amped; they love him. This is Bernie's moment.And likely his only one.Farther south, on that same Tuesday, another crowd of Democrats has assembled at Nashua Community College. This one isn't so electric. It looks more . . . determined. Those gathered also love Bernie. They love his ""enthusiasm"" and how ""bold"" he is and his ""truth."" Yet here they are, at a Hillary Clinton rally.Bernie ""is unelectable,"" says Darius Mohsenin, a Democrat from California who has flown all the way here to check out the contenders. ""I like Bernie's message. He's bringing up a lot of third-rail items."" The 56-year-old landlord particularly likes the Vermonter's focus on ""income inequality."" Is Hillary addressing that issue? ""She's hinting at it. It's embedded in her platform, but not as much."" The point is, he says, ""she can win.""Witness the triumph of the Clinton machine. The media are playing up the Iowa results as a Clinton-Sanders ""tie,"" pitching the possibility of a drawn-out fight for the Democratic nomination. In fact, Mrs. Clinton is hitting her stride, making electability a potent anti-Sanders message. She knows that the more voters tune in, the more they realize the stakes. So she's reminding them every chance she can that the White House and Barack Obama's legacy are on the line.That's why Mrs. Clinton is bear-hugging Mr. Obama, promising to protect and expand on his work. It's why she insists that Mr. Sanders's plan for single-payer health care will ""never, ever come to pass"" -- her way of warning Democrats that Bernie could never, ever get elected. It's why she keeps droning on about ""reality."" It's why the supposedly ""neutral"" Mr. Obama piled on to assure that Hillary could ""govern"" and ""start here, day one, more experienced"" than Bernie.Pundits keep weighing in on Mr. Sanders's demographic problems after New Hampshire, his difficulty attracting black voters in, say, South Carolina. But electability is rapidly becoming the bigger liability. Leading Democrats are now assisting Mrs. Clinton by openly questioning his age, his radicalism, his potential to fracture the party and keep moderate Democrats from the polls. When Mr. Sanders attacks Mrs. Clinton on Twitter as a ""moderate,"" he's helping their argument.Many Democrats are open to this message. They hail from states whose governments in recent years have become dominated by Republicans. They've witnessed the backlash to Mr. Obama's policies, and they know Mr. Sanders makes the current president look tame.And so they are eating their Clinton spinach. Not that they like it. Mr. Sanders promises his passionate crowds a revolution. At the Nashua rally, Bill Clinton by contrast introduces his wife with the leaden promise that she will ""show up every day."" This is the theme of every Hillary campaign: that she's the worker bee, the realist, the survivor. It's meant to be reassuring, but the attendees who are (dutifully) clapping and (dutifully) cheering also look as if they are embarking on a long march. Another Clinton presidency would be a daily grind. But at least it'd be a Democratic grind.The electability line has become so potent that Mr. Sanders is openly trying to refute it. He points to polls that show him faring better against Republicans than Mrs. Clinton. His team points out how much more favorably he is viewed by voters than she. Mr. Sanders even insists that Democrats need him if they want to keep the White House. ""Republicans win,"" he said in Iowa, ""when people become demoralized, when they give up on the political process, and when they don't vote."" His nomination, he promised, would raise excitement and turnout.The only point Mr. Sanders won't make is the one that would be most effective. He refuses to make a case that Mrs. Clinton is unelectable. While the Vermonter has notably sharpened his attacks on Hillary -- blasting her ties to big banks -- he still refuses to raise the scandal of the FBI investigation into her private email server. He's foregoing a powerful, and honest, argument that Mrs. Clinton remains a huge risk to her party -- particularly given how worried many Democrats are about a prosecution, and how little they trust Hillary.This is the story of the Sanders campaign: a continuing reluctance to play to win. The socialist keeps bragging that he's fighting the machine. But he isn't, really. The powers that early on anointed and sanctioned Hillary's candidacy are today undercutting Mr. Sanders, painting him as a modern George McGovern loon. You don't fight that machine with group singalongs. That's why next week's vote in New Hampshire may prove to be the apex of Bernie's career.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",4/8/16
"Election 2016: Clinton, Sanders Sharpen Their Rhetoric --- Democrats spar over who is 'progressive' and the senator's edge in a neighboring state",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762314534?accountid=12768,"DERRY, N.H. -- Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders stepped up their attacks before they meet for a one-on-one debate Thursday, campaigning aggressively in a state that her campaign says she may not be able to win.Trailing by double digits in New Hampshire polls, Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday rejected suggestions that she look past the state and focus instead on friendlier territory, as both campaigns sharpened their tones and sparred from afar.Mr. Sanders jabbed first on Tuesday when he said the former senator and secretary of state is a progressive on some days. ""Except when she announces she's a moderate,"" he added. ""Then she's not a progressive.""Mrs. Clinton responded at a get-out-the-vote event, calling her opponent's comments a ""low blow"" and saying she has delivered results for progressives. She said the race should focus on issues, but added that ""if it's about our records, hey, I'm going to win by a landslide.""The squabble over which candidate is more progressive ramped up online with a series of tweets from Mr. Sanders's account, including a long list of more moderate policy positions that Mrs. Clinton has taken in the past.The two Democrats continued to parse the definition of progressive during a town hall event Wednesday night. Mr. Sanders noted that the former secretary of state has described herself as a moderate in the past.""You can't be a moderate and a progressive -- they are different,"" Mr. Sanders said.When Mrs. Clinton took the stage, she said she was amused that her rival had cast himself as a gatekeeper determining who is a progressive. ""I don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons,"" she said.Earlier, Mrs. Clinton's campaign suggested that Mr. Sanders has built-in advantages in New Hampshire because he represents neighboring Vermont. Mr. Sanders parried, saying New Hampshire voters are serious about their role in the nominating process and that ""to repeatedly suggest otherwise is an insult"" to them.Mr. Sanders said on CNN that the Clinton campaign is financed by Wall Street and big-money interests. Mrs. Clinton countered by critiquing her rival's health-care plan.This intensifying tit-for-tat is playing out in a state where Mrs. Clinton is a decided long-shot. A Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Mr. Sanders with an 18-percentage-point advantage in Tuesday's primary, and some have suggested Mrs. Clinton should focus her resources on the states that will vote shortly after New Hampshire.""Not on your life,"" Mrs. Clinton told supporters Wednesday. ""I would never quit on New Hampshire.""The Clinton campaign has tried to lower expectations in recent days, saying that Mrs. Clinton's 2008 come-from-behind win in New Hampshire is unlikely to be replicated. Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton's communications director, said Mr. Sanders has a substantial lead but that the former secretary of state would stay in New Hampshire through the primary, trying to build support.""We don't know that we can win, but she is going to be here every day,"" Ms. Palmieri said.The Sanders campaign pushed back against the Clinton team's attempts to play down her prospects. ""They're overplaying their hand on this 'He's a neighbor' stuff,' "" said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders campaign strategist. ""Our view is we're up against the whole establishment again.""The battle for New Hampshire and the tonal shift in the Democratic campaign come on the heels of a hard-fought contest in Iowa that saw Mrs. Clinton eke out a razor-thin win.Some Democratic strategists said Mrs. Clinton remains in a stronger position for the long term. With the race soon moving to states with higher percentages of minority voters, Mrs. Clinton stands to do better, they said. Steve McMahon, a longtime Democratic consultant, said the Iowa result ""helped Bernie, but it wasn't enough of a 'Voila!' moment to change the dynamic in South Carolina and Nevada.""Mr. Sanders is telling supporters that the political establishment is growing nervous about his staying power. Winning the nomination won't be easy, the senator said, but he noted that in Iowa he took on the ""most powerful political organization in the country.""For her part, Mrs. Clinton is positioning herself as a fighter, not a front-runner, and is quick to remind voters that she is running against a ""neighbor."" She urges, ""New Hampshire, come with me.""---Jennifer Levitz contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Peter Nicholas",4/8/16
Bernie Sanders Will Visit the Vatican; Democratic candidate to leave the trail for a meeting on economic and social issues,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779542234?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will visit the Vatican next week to discuss themes of economic and social justice that are the centerpiece of his campaign.The Vermont senator said Friday that he would participate in an April 15 conference on social, economic and environmental issues at a Vatican academic organization, stepping off the campaign trail during the crucial last days before the New York primary.Mr. Sanders said he was ""moved"" by the invitation and said he deeply admired Pope Francis, whom he isn't expected to meet with on the trip. In an MSNBC interview Friday morning, he praised the pope's efforts to ""inject a sense of morality into how we do economics."" The pope has called for actions to address income inequality and has criticized American-style capitalism.The trip was announced as Mr. Sanders is looking to move past a tussle with his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, whom he denigrated this past week as ""unqualified"" for the presidency. He dialed back on those remarks Friday morning, saying ""of course"" Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, was qualified to be commander in chief.""On her worst day she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates,"" Mr. Sanders said on NBC, adding that the two Democratic candidates should focus on the issues instead of leveling personal attacks.Related Reading* Bernie Sanders Says 'Of Course' Hillary Clinton Is Qualified* Pope Francis Calls for Leniency Toward Divorced Catholics* War of Words Escalates in Democratic RaceMrs. Clinton, asked Friday in Buffalo, N.Y., if Mr. Sanders was qualified to be president, affirmed that he was. ""As I said, I would take him over Donald Trump and Ted Cruz any day,"" she said.Mr. Sanders's visit to the Vatican could carry a political benefit, coming just days before the primary in heavily Catholic New York. About 30% of the state's adult population is Catholic, according to the Pew Research Center, versus about 20% of Americans overall.""I am a big, big fan of the pope,"" Mr. Sanders said on MSNBC on Friday. ""Obviously, there are areas where we disagree--on women's rights or gay rights.""The contest in New York also has extra resonance for both candidates: Mrs. Clinton represented the state in the Senate for eight years before serving in the Obama administration, while Mr. Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn. Most polls show Mrs. Clinton with a lead in New York, and she has a sizable lead in convention delegates, although Mr. Sanders's recent primary wins have tightened that gap.Mr. Sanders is Jewish but hasn't made religion a centerpiece of either his campaign or his political identity, speaking only occasionally about his background.""I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being,"" he said at a Democratic debate earlier this year.The event at the Vatican will focus on creating an economy of ""dignity, social justice and environmental sustainability,"" the Sanders campaign said. Also listed on the program are Bolivian President Evo Morales and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa.The announcement of the trip was briefly the subject of a dispute between two officials within the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, the organization hosting the event.On Friday morning, Margaret Archer, the organization's president, told Bloomberg that Mr. Sanders had sought out the invitation to boost his campaign and accused him of a ""monumental discourtesy.""The Sanders campaign said it never sought the invitation, an account confirmed by Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, who is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.""The initiative did not come from the senator,"" he said in an interview. ""He was invited like all the other participants in the conference, in a letter from me as chancellor, writing in the name of the president."" Ms. Archer couldn't be reached for comment.The Sanders event was announced on the same day that Pope Francis urged a more lenient approach to divorced Catholics , effectively encouraging clergy to grant some divorced people Holy Communion and opening a new phase in a long-running struggle within the church over its moral teaching.""By thinking that everything is black and white, we sometimes close off the way of grace and of growth,"" the pope wrote in an apostolic exhortation titled ""On Love in the Family.""Francis X.

Bernie Sanders Wins Wyoming's Democratic Caucuses; Delegates to be distributed proportionally; Hillary Clinton maintains lead,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779687828?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Wyoming caucuses on Saturday, adding to a string of recent victories and giving his underdog campaign a shot of momentum heading into the more important New York primary this month.The Associated Press said Mr. Sanders beat front-runner Hillary Clinton. However, because the margin was close between the candidates, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton wound up with seven delegates each, the AP said.The victory means Mr. Sanders has come out ahead in seven of their last eight state contests. But in this case the win did nothing to dent Mrs. Clinton's formidable lead.Before the caucuses, Mrs. Clinton led the race with 1,749 delegates, compared with Mr. Sanders's 1,061, including both pledged delegates chosen by voters and superdelegates, who can support any candidate. A candidate needs 2,383 delegates to clinch the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.The Wyoming contest was made to order for Mr. Sanders. The state is overwhelmingly white, and white voters have been much more supportive of the Vermont senator than minorities. The caucus format, which tends to attract the most liberal activists, has often been an advantage for him as well.Mr. Sanders appeared in the state once, at a rally in Laramie that drew some 1,800 people. Mrs. Clinton didn't appear in Wyoming, though her husband, former President Bill Clinton, headlined an event in Cheyenne.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler",4/11/16

Rank-and-file Sanders activists have taken it upon themselves to assist, using social media, emails and phone calls in ways that have created a backlash among the very people Mr. Sanders is hoping to win over.A California superdelegate backing Mrs. Clinton, Bob Mulholland, wrote a letter to Mr. Sanders this week saying the outreach to superdelegates from Sanders voters has gotten offensive, including calls coming late at night. Other superdelegates said they have gotten unwanted calls at work from Sanders backers, or have seen their Facebook pages flooded with warnings of political repercussions for supporting Mrs. Clinton.Election Graphics* Even With Different Superdelegate Rules, Sanders Still Falls Short* Who's Winning the Delegate Race?Mr. Sanders is currently far behind among the superdelegates , most of whom get their convention votes by virtue of being elected officials and party leaders. At this point, a total of 469 superdelegates are backing Mrs. Clinton, and only 31 are supporting Mr. Sanders, according to an Associated Press tally. Another 214 have yet to express a preference.Overall, Mrs. Clinton leads the race by 1,749 delegates to Mr. Sanders's 1,061. With candidates needing 2,383 delegates to clinch, superdelegates have considerable influence in picking the nominee by dint of their numbers and because they can change their preference at any time. Their outsize role results from efforts by the party to head off long-shot candidates and avoid such landslide defeats as Sen. George McGovern's in 1972.Senior Sanders strategist Tad Devine said Thursday that, independent of the campaign's courtship of superdelegates, some Sanders enthusiasts have launched their own ""spontaneous"" effort to help the cause.""A lot of people are motivated to make the argument on behalf of Bernie,"" Mr. Devine said. ""We're not encouraging them in that; we're not organizing them,"" he said, adding that ""we're not discouraging them except if we hear of someone pushing a little too hard.""One argument the Sanders campaign is making to Clinton supporters: Superdelegates in states that voted for Mr. Sanders should back his candidacy so that they are in sync with voters. Yet the Sanders campaign also said it intends to court superdelegates in states that Mrs. Clinton won.A Clinton adviser said the Sanders strategy suggests the campaign recognizes it can't overtake her lead by any other means. ""The fact that they are articulating a path that relies on trying to wrest away superdelegates that have previously committed to us shows what dire straits they're in,"" said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.Mrs. Clinton's staff sends a regular email update to superdelegate supporters and arranges conference calls with senior aides. Having seen scores of superdelegates defect to then-Sen. Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, Mrs. Clinton is eager to keep her superdelegates in the fold this time around.One pro-Clinton superdelegate said a recent email message from her campaign included the line ""Feel the Math""--a play on the Sanders campaign's signature phrase, ""Feel the Bern,"" and a message that she enjoys a lead that Mr. Sanders will be hard-pressed to overcome.Mr. Sanders recently tapped Paul Kirk, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, to help court superdelegates. So far, Mr. Kirk said he is targeting the group who are as yet publicly uncommitted.Related Reading* Bernie Sanders Says 'Of Course' Hillary Clinton Is Qualified* Pope Francis Calls for Leniency Toward Divorced Catholics* War of Words Escalates in Democratic RaceThe overtures from grass-roots supporters are more freewheeling. Sen. Maria Cantwell is a pro-Clinton superdelegate from Washington, a state won by Mr. Sanders with 72% of the caucus voters. Her Facebook page is awash in comments from Sanders supporters asking her to abandon Mrs. Clinton for the Vermont senator. A recent post by Ms. Cantwell congratulating the University of Washington women's basketball team for making the Final Four was greeted with comments from Sanders supporters skewering her for backing Ms. Clinton.""We are watching you, Sen. Maria Cantwell,"" one person wrote. ""Don't even think about going against the majority and backing HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] when your state wants Bernie Sanders.""A Cantwell spokesman said she is backing Mrs. Clinton because of positions the former secretary of state has taken on issues that are helpful to the state economy.Peggy Schaffer is a superdelegate from Maine, a state also won by Mr. Sanders. A longtime Clinton supporter, she said she will back whichever candidate winds up with the most pledged delegates in the end. Ms. Schaffer said Sanders supporters have launched a full-court press in her state, using emails, phone calls, letters and tweets to get her to back Mr. Sanders.At times, it can be uncomfortable. As a state employee, Ms. Schaffer isn't permitted to engage in political activities while on the job. But Mr. Sanders's backers repeatedly have called her work phone and have sent letters to her office.She has asked them to stop, but some have persisted. ""I wish some of them would tone it down a little,"" she said.While she has been flooded with messages from Sanders supporters, Ms. Schaffer said she has heard from just one Clinton backer who urged her to ""stick to her guns.""Rep. Rick Nolan (D., Minn.) is an uncommitted superdelegate who has no plans to make a formal endorsement anytime soon. Mr. Sanders won the Minnesota caucus on March 1, and his supporters have been pressing the congressman.Joe Radinovich, the congressman's campaign manager, said Sanders backers have approached Mr. Nolan at political events, questioning why he hasn't sided with a candidate and making passionate pitches for their choice. One Sanders supporter who made a small donation to Mr. Nolan's campaign called and said he wouldn't make any more contributions unless the congressman supported Mr. Sanders. Mr. Nolan was unmoved by the threat, Mr. Radinovich said.Sanders supporters also have been a vocal presence on Mr. Nolan's Facebook page, responding to nearly every post with pleas for the congressman to back Mr. Sanders--and suggestions that his political future hinges on his decision.""Do you really think your constituents are going to vote you back in when 60% of your state voted for Bernie?"" one Sanders supporter asked.Mr. Nolan has said little on the subject, but after reports emerged describing the congressman as a Clinton superdelegate, his campaign moved quickly to clarify, releasing a statement saying that he hasn't endorsed either Democratic presidential candidate.Dennis Archer, the former Detroit mayor, has been bombarded with emails from Sanders supporters in Michigan and across the country, urging him to switch his allegiance as a superdelegate. But Mr. Archer's friendship and working relationship with former President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton span decades, and he remains firmly committed to her.""She is the best-qualified candidate to be president of the United States, and therefore I'm supporting her, and I'm not going to change,"" Mr. Archer said.The former mayor noted a recurring theme in the emails he has received, suggesting that if ""superdelegates don't change their mind [Sanders supporters] are not going to vote Democratic.""""Now, how's that going to be a winning argument?"" Mr. Archer asked.As more states vote, the Sanders campaign said it will ratchet up its outreach to superdelegates. For some, it will be the first time they have heard from Mr. Sanders.Ken Martin is a superdelegate from Minnesota who chairs the state's Democratic Party. A member of Mrs. Clinton's campaign fundraising team, he said he will support whoever ends up with the most pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders, he said, ""never reached out"" to him.

A recent post by Ms. Cantwell congratulating the University of Washington women's basketball team for making the Final Four was greeted with comments from Sanders supporters skewering her for backing Ms. Clinton.""We are watching you, Sen. Maria Cantwell,"" one person wrote. ""Don't even think about going against the majority and backing HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] when your state wants Bernie Sanders.""A Cantwell spokesman said she is backing Mrs. Clinton because of positions the former secretary of state has taken on issues that are helpful to the state economy.Peggy Schaffer is a superdelegate from Maine, a state also won by Mr. Sanders. A longtime Clinton supporter, she said she will back whichever candidate winds up with the most pledged delegates in the end. Ms. Schaffer said Sanders supporters have launched a full-court press in her state, using emails, phone calls, letters and tweets to get her to back Mr. Sanders.At times, it can be uncomfortable. As a state employee, Ms. Schaffer isn't permitted to engage in political activities while on the job. But Mr. Sanders's backers repeatedly have called her work phone and have sent letters to her office.She has asked them to stop, but some have persisted. ""I wish some of them would tone it down a little,"" she said.While she has been flooded with messages from Sanders supporters, Ms. Schaffer said she has heard from just one Clinton backer who urged her to ""stick to her guns.""Rep. Rick Nolan (D., Minn.) is an uncommitted superdelegate who has no plans to make a formal endorsement anytime soon. Mr. Sanders won the Minnesota caucus on March 1, and his supporters have been pressing the congressman.Joe Radinovich, the congressman's campaign manager, said Sanders backers have approached Mr. Nolan at political events, questioning why he hasn't sided with a candidate and making passionate pitches for their choice. One Sanders supporter who made a small donation to Mr. Nolan's campaign called and said he wouldn't make any more contributions unless the congressman supported Mr. Sanders. Mr. Nolan was unmoved by the threat, Mr. Radinovich said.Sanders supporters also have been a vocal presence on Mr. Nolan's Facebook page, responding to nearly every post with pleas for the congressman to back Mr. Sanders--and suggestions that his political future hinges on his decision.""Do you really think your constituents are going to vote you back in when 60% of your state voted for Bernie?"" one Sanders supporter asked.Mr. Nolan has said little on the subject, but after reports emerged describing the congressman as a Clinton superdelegate, his campaign moved quickly to clarify, releasing a statement saying that he hasn't endorsed either Democratic presidential candidate.Dennis Archer, the former Detroit mayor, has been bombarded with emails from Sanders supporters in Michigan and across the country, urging him to switch his allegiance as a superdelegate. But Mr. Archer's friendship and working relationship with former President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton span decades, and he remains firmly committed to her.""She is the best-qualified candidate to be president of the United States, and therefore I'm supporting her, and I'm not going to change,"" Mr. Archer said.The former mayor noted a recurring theme in the emails he has received, suggesting that if ""superdelegates don't change their mind [Sanders supporters] are not going to vote Democratic.""""Now, how's that going to be a winning argument?"" Mr. Archer asked.As more states vote, the Sanders campaign said it will ratchet up its outreach to superdelegates. For some, it will be the first time they have heard from Mr. Sanders.Ken Martin is a superdelegate from Minnesota who chairs the state's Democratic Party. A member of Mrs. Clinton's campaign fundraising team, he said he will support whoever ends up with the most pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders, he said, ""never reached out"" to him. ""Now at this late stage ... he's asking us for our support.""Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Colleen McCain Nelson",4/11/16
"New York's Vote Matters for a Change; Trump tries to recover from his Wisconsin deflation, while Sanders finally gets aggressive.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779532616?accountid=12768,"In Wisconsin and in the weeks leading up to it Donald Trump got wounded. Big animals get wounded and come back. The question is whether he's a big animal or something smaller that skittered around the forest and finally picked the wrong fight.Wisconsin almost certainly foreclosed his chance to walk into Cleveland with enough delegates to win on the first ballot. The convention will be open, and contested.There's nothing easy about Mr. Trump. He leaves his supporters' hearts in their mouths. He leaves his enemies happy then self-doubting, triumphant then fatalistic. But what we have witnessed the past few weeks is his deflation, a real one, and the worst kind: It was all his fault. It wasn't the anti-Trump forces and it wasn't Ted Cruz, it was his lax, louche indiscipline.But now we cut to New York. We are about to witness something of a Trump reinflation.The other night he drew some 10,000 people to a rally in Bethpage, Long Island, which the Daily News called ""riotous"" and Newsday called ""rousing."" I lived in Long Island from age 5 to 16 and go there often. My friends and their children are a generation or two from Brooklyn and Queens, and Brooklyn and Queens were one or two generations from the old country. Long Islanders carry within them, still and more than they know, a love for America tinged by family lore of the immigrant experience--an old and patriotic sense that gets mixed up, in the current way, with a nationalistic sense. Republicans who were amusing themselves on social media the night of the rally--as word spread of turnout they were sending out pictures of Joey Buttafuoco--look down on those rally-goers at their peril. They will be part of the base of whatever takes the place of the current Republican Party.Mr. Trump, in the video I saw, was masterly. ""We don't win anymore,"" he said. ""We don't fight like people from Long Island. We don't fight like people from New York."" He laid into Mr. Cruz: ""Remember when he started lecturing me on 'New York values' like we're no good?"" That was the authentic sound of working New York: ""Like we're no good.""And it felt fresh, because no one really campaigns for the presidency in New York anymore. Its primaries are in April, usually after everything's been settled. In the general election New York's in the bag for the Democrats, so why should they expend the energy or Republicans the time?Candidates for president only come here for major media interviews and for money. They pick Manhattan up and shake it like a big pink piggy bank--$60K at the downtown breakfast, $600K at the uptown cocktail party. They enter the homes of the great and powerful--the spacious rooms, high ceilings, plump sofas, shiny floors, important art, views of Central Park--and they think: ""Boy, they sure got it good. Maybe the economy isn't so bad!""The rich of New York thus hold an outsize place in the Republican and Democratic imagination. But the not-rich--the middle, the hanging-on and the poor--have no place at all.Republicans especially, the past 20 or so years, have no sense of them. They know the hedge-funders and the rooms with the Rothkos. Their vision of everything else comes from old movies like ""Dog Day Afternoon."" They're surprised we're not all running around in the streets shouting ""Attica! Attica!""What Republicans especially fail to appreciate is that New York more than ever is full of legal immigrants. If you sit on the side of a street fair in non-hipster Brooklyn--in Bay Ridge, for instance--you'll see all the world passing by: people from China, Ireland, Lebanon, Poland, South and Central America, Asia, Africa, Arabia. They are young. They're expending all their energy doing what people do to establish themselves--finding the job, keeping it, paying the rent, finding someone to love, making a family, making it all work.So far they have no time for politics--but they will. They're not aligned--but they will be. They are open to persuasion. They will consider your argument. All you have to do is be there and talk to them. If the Republican Party were thinking long-term, it would. Maybe when the party is reconstituting itself--trying to rebuild a damaged or destroyed party, or inventing a new one--they'll recognize these people too as a potential part of their base.In any case Mr. Trump is expected to win big. He's 31 points ahead in the polls. Is there any chance he can discipline himself and sustain the discipline, create a real campaign, professionalize his operation? Would it make a difference? Or are his reputation and his mess set so firmly in concrete nothing can change his outcome?On the Democratic side Bernie Sanders has turned tough. He seems to have come face to face with the fact that he really wants to win. He said Hillary Clinton is not ""qualified"" to be president because of her support for the Iraq war, ""disastrous"" trade policies, and taking Wall Street money. His campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, upped the ante by saying if Mrs. Clinton hits back unfairly, ""they're going to see how a real New Yorker fights back.""God bless New York for stripping the passive from the passive-aggressive campaign they were waging against each other until this week.I saw Mrs. Clinton at Harlem's Apollo Theater last week. The audience was appropriately enthusiastic but not wild. Soon after, I watched the Sanders rally in the Bronx--a crowd of at least 15,000 that was wild. A Hillary supporter I spoke to at the Apollo confessed she was there to reignite her excitement. In her life she was surrounded by Bernie supporters. It leaves you feeling defensive.If he dings her bad or wins in New York it will be a real setback for Mrs. Clinton, and an embarrassment.Everything on both sides is still so in play.Washington Republicans continue their fantasy of the white knight who comes to Cleveland and saves the day--the magical unifying figure who electrifies the convention and wins on the fourth ballot. But how would the large majority of Republicans who've voted for Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz feel about that? Not good!Again, if Mr. Trump wins, a significant part of the party splits off. If he doesn't, a significant part of the party likely isn't there in November. I was asked this week if Trump always intended to break the party. I don't think so; I think he set out to win. But whether he wins or not he has succeeded in demonstrating to the party that it is and was broken. He made the information unavoidable.A friend with whom I'd been discussing the convention, a former Romney bundler, this week sent me a gift: handsome two-inch heels, heavily padded on the sole so if there is trouble you could run in them. The outside fabric is rough camouflage, the kind a soldier would wear in the field.That's a fellow whose fantasy of what the convention will be like is probably closer to the mark.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",4/11/16
A Vast Email Conspiracy; Hillary's biggest problem isn't Bernie. It's the Freedom of Information Act.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779280827?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is good at imagining partisan plots, and to listen to her team, no less than several inspectors general, the intelligence community, and the entire Republican ecosphere are colluding to turn her home-brew email system into a fake scandal. To this conspiracy, she must now add the federal judiciary.In recent weeks, not one, but two, esteemed federal judges have granted an outside group--Judicial Watch--the right to conduct discovery into the origins and handling of her private email system. It's a reminder that Mrs. Clinton's biggest problem this election isn't Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump. Her problem is a 1966 statute known as the Freedom of Information Act, and the judges who enforce it.The judges have taken unprecedented steps to resolve this case. It is exceedingly rare--almost unheard of--for a judge to allow discovery in a FOIA proceeding. This is a testament to how grave Mrs. Clinton's email problem is. In the usual course of things, an outside group demands documents, a judge requires a federal department to hand them over, and the public learns something.In this case--as we all know--the problem is that the State Department doesn't have the documents. Or rather, it can't confirm that it has them all, because State left it to Mrs. Clinton and her aides to possess them, and then to unilaterally decide what to hand over. To Judge Royce Lamberth, this is cut and dry ""evidence of government wrong-doing and bad faith,"" and the law demands a full accounting of how this situation came to be, what records exist, and where they are now.Speaking of the judge's words, they too are a testament to Mrs. Clinton's mess. Judge Lamberth was unplugged in his order, calling the former secretary of state's email set up ""extraordinary,"" and slamming ""constantly shifting admissions by the government and former government officials"" about the setup. Judge Emmet Sullivan, the first to allow discovery, referred in his own hearing to Mrs. Clinton's ""totally atypical system"" and noted that it ""boggles the mind that the State Department allowed this circumstance to arise in the first place. It's just very, very, very troubling.""Fueling the judges' suspicions has been new evidence that Mrs. Clinton didn't turn everything over. Judicial Watch recently obtained emails showing that State Department and National Security Agency personnel had big concerns with Mrs. Clinton's early demands that she be allowed to use a BlackBerry for secure correspondence. They wanted her to sit at a computer in a secure facility--as everyone else does. These documents include a February 2009 email from then-Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills to her boss, crowing that State was coming around to Mrs. Clinton's demands, and a return email the same day from Mrs. Clinton saying, ""That's good news.""These are clearly work-related emails. They speak to the question of Mrs. Clinton's communications while at the State Department. They aren't about yoga routines. And yet, guess what? That email chain was not included in the 55,000 pages of documents Mrs. Clinton turned over. Perhaps it was an oversight, but far more likely, the Clinton team--knowing the firestorm over a home-brew system--chose to withhold documents showing that State and NSA considered Mrs. Clinton's email demands unsafe and unreasonable. What else did Mrs. Clinton choose to withhold from the public?One other aspect of these new emails: Mrs. Clinton sent her ""good news"" email to Ms. Mills via her private hdr22@clintonemail.com account in February 2009. And yet the former secretary of state has publicly claimed she didn't start using that address until March 2009, well after she was sworn in as secretary of state.Judicial Watch is hoping to use discovery to interview eight current and former State Department officials, including Ms. Mills, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, top State Department official Patrick Kennedy, and former State IT employees Bryan Pagliano (who is reported to have recently been granted immunity by the FBI). And yet in a hearing this week in Judge Sullivan's court, State Department officials were already moving to limit or shut down what questions Judicial Watch could ask--including those pertaining to how classified information was handled on the system.Put another way, State wants to put off-limits the questions that are at the heart of the Clinton email scandal. And no surprise. The Judicial Watch discovery holds the potential to expose the many and varied ways Mrs. Clinton may have skirted the rules, and in turn to put enormous pressure on the FBI to act. These depositions meanwhile are currently set to happen this summer, right before the Democratic convention.The beauty of FOIA is that it is designed to bring things to light. Mrs. Clinton has grown talented at outfoxing investigators, Congress, inspectors general, the press. But she made the error this time of playing games with a law that federal judges take seriously, and that gives outside watchdogs real leverage.Write to kim@wsj.com.Credit: By Kimberley A.

Democrats' Shift Left Aids Sanders --- Candidate's liberal positions attract young as Socialism loses its sting,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762932391?accountid=12768,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Then-Sen. Barack Obama had to spend precious days at the close of his 2008 presidential campaign to defend against charges of socialism after he casually suggested his tax plan would ""spread the wealth around.""Today, seeking the same job in the same party, Sen. Bernie Sanders proudly wears the democratic socialist label and touts a sweeping plan designed to spread the wealth. He calls for a ""political revolution"" to vastly expand the government's role in American life and sharply cut the power of Wall Street and the role of money in politics. And he draws voters too young to care about socialism's Cold War stigma and who came of age during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.Mr. Sanders, so liberal he resisted joining the Democratic Party for decades, hasn't changed his views since his first election to office 35 years ago. Yet he now represents a substantial swath of his party's left flank.What has changed is the Democratic Party, whose voters have moved to the left over the course of both Republican and Democratic administrations, and, like the Republican Party, are responding to a rising populist tide.Mr. Sanders's proposals amount to a more significant expansion of government than any viable presidential candidate has proposed in years, supported by more new spending than many Democrats would like.Three ideas in particular -- on Social Security, college subsidies and health care -- show how his thinking and the party's most liberal voters have aligned.On Social Security, Mr. Sanders, age 74, wants to increase benefits for everyone, a position barely discussed a few years ago, as most Democrats focused on maintaining the program's long-term solvency and defending it from Republican privatization proposals.On college, he proposes a $750 billion program to make tuition free at all public colleges and universities -- paid for by a new tax on financial transactions.And on health care, Mr. Sanders wants to go far beyond the Affordable Care Act by replacing private insurance companies with government-run coverage. Here, he speaks for many liberals who have long supported a universal, single-payer health-care system but haven't seriously pushed it in years.All three proposals would require congressional approval, considered highly unlikely with the current GOP majority. Mr. Sanders says a political revolution is needed to pressure lawmakers.Socialism appears to carry far less of a stigma than it once did, particularly among young people who form the base of Mr. Sanders's support. A Boston Globe poll of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire released Saturday found 31% said the term ""socialist"" described them; among those ages 17 to 34, it was just over half.In the Iowa caucuses, voters under age 30 supported Mr. Sanders over rival Hillary Clinton, 84% to 14%.Growth of the party's left wing has taken a toll on Mrs. Clinton, who for years was tagged as an ultra-liberal but must now prove her credentials as a progressive and explain her long ties to Wall Street. Mrs. Clinton narrowly won the Iowa caucuses last week, and now trails in polls ahead of the primary Tuesday in New Hampshire, which borders Mr. Sanders's home state of Vermont. Nationally, she is first in polls.Mrs. Clinton's campaign proposals are less sweeping and less expensive, though she argues they are more effective and far more realistic in an era of wide ideological divisions.Mr. Sanders's surprising success -- and Mrs. Clinton's travails -- highlight how far the party has moved leftward since her husband, former President Bill Clinton, steered it to the center in the early 1990s.The Republican Party, meanwhile, has veered to the right.Polls illustrate the shift in both parties. In 1990, just 13% of Democrats called themselves ""very liberal,"" while 12% of Republicans identified as ""very conservative,"" according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. By last year the number was 26% for Democrats and 29% for Republicans.When Mr. Clinton was elected president in 1992, Democrats were coming off 12 years of Republican control of the White House, and many in the party were determined to show voters they were tough on crime, friendly to business, concerned about the federal budget and careful with taxpayer money. Mr. Clinton was chief spokesman for the party's centrist agenda.""It was considered good politics for Democrats to show people on Wall Street approved of their economic plans,"" said Peter Beinart, who has studied the evolution of the Democratic Party at the City University of New York. ""In the 1990s, Wall Street had a lot of prestige.""President George W. Bush's election in 2000 sparked a revival of the Democratic Party's left wing: His tax plan, for example, yielded significant cuts for the wealthy, and, in 2002, he won congressional approval to invade Iraq.Both measures passed with the help of Democratic lawmakers, stirring fury among liberal Democrats, who found new outlets for their anger -- from the liberal blog Daily Kos and MoveOn.org to the presidential campaign of Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who ran in 2004 against the war and the tax cuts.The seeds of a progressive movement inside the party appeared to flower with Mr. Obama's 2008 election, but many liberals soon chafed. On health care, Mr. Obama failed to secure a government-run option to compete with private insurance companies in the new insurance marketplaces, they complained. The president enraged many liberals when he suggested he was willing to cut Social Security benefits to win a grand budget bargain in 2011.Such swelling voices served as the backdrop for Mr. Sanders's suggestion that a candidate on the left challenge Mr. Obama in the 2012 election.""There are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president; who believe that, with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president,"" Mr. Sanders told a radio interviewer in 2011.The party was also becoming more liberal as conservative Democrats were defeated or retired, and Republican lawmakers took hold of the South. The shift left the Democratic base concentrated in the Northeast, upper Midwest and West Coast, reliant on a more liberal voting bloc compared with the working-class white voters who once formed an important party foundation.Anger mounted during the Obama years over growing income inequality, particularly after Wall Street bailouts rescued some of the country's richest people while many Americans struggled financially in a tepid job market.Statistics explain voter fury. The top 3% of households had more than twice as much wealth in 2013 as the bottom 90% put together, according to the Federal Reserve. The top 400 taxpayers' share of U.S. income doubled in two decades, according to the Internal Revenue Service. While top incomes rose, every other group was stagnant.Much like the tea party, which grew out of anger on the political right over Wall Street bailouts, anger on the left surfaced in the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests. The movement fizzled, but not before raising income inequality to national debate.In 2011, Elizabeth Warren, a formerly obscure Harvard bankruptcy professor, became a national sensation on the left by challenging wealthy Americans to recognize that public investment -- in roads and education, for example -- helped enable their success. ""There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody,"" she said, in an oft-repeated quote.Ms. Warren was elected to the Senate in 2012, and her supporters later urged her to run for president in 2016. She declined, but Mr. Sanders picked up many of her supporters and then some.The Occupy Wall Street movement opened the door for Sen. Warren, who paved the way for Sen. Sanders, said Jeremy Varon, a history professor at the New School in New York, who has studied the movement.""Here's a guy who owns the label of socialist. It's inconceivable that a major candidate would have done that prior to Occupy,"" Mr. Varon said. ""Occupy gave a new prestige to a set of ideas that were normally considered quite marginal.""As a candidate, Mr. Sanders's proposals would cost some $17 trillion over 10 years, according to his campaign, which amounts to a one-third increase in the total size of government and the largest peacetime expansion in modern U.S. history.His most expensive proposal, about $1.4 trillion annually, is for a ""Medicare for all"" government-financed health care system, which he said was needed to ensure all Americans have affordable health coverage and to control costs. His plan would disconnect health insurance from employment; businesses and individuals would no longer pay premiums.Mr. Sanders said he would pay for the plan with a new 6.2% payroll tax on employers, a 2.2% income tax on all taxpayers and new taxes on high-income households. Under Mr. Sanders's plan, the top federal income-tax rate would exceed 50% for the first time since 1980.The last Democratic presidential candidate to propose a single-payer health care program was California Gov. Jerry Brown in 1992. Yet support for the idea dates back decades. More than 60 House Democrats currently back single-payer legislation.Social Security provides way too little for retirement, Mr. Sanders said, citing elderly people trying to get by on payments of $12,000 or so a year. He would increase benefits and pay for them, he said, applying the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax -- paid by employers and employees -- on income over $250,000. The tax is currently applied only to the first $118,500 of wages.His proposal would have been jarring until recently. Democrats opposed GOP efforts to privatize the program, but few talked about expanding the program. Democrats focused on the issue typically worried about the program's long-term shortfall, and hoped for a bipartisan agreement to bolster the program, likely a combination of higher taxes and reduced benefits.Mr. Obama proposed a small benefit cut during the 2011 budget negotiations, prompting an outcry from the left. The idea sank, but liberals concluded their best defense against cuts was a good offense: They began advocating for benefit increases.Now, a group favoring expanded benefits counts 141 Democratic House members supporting their cause, and, in the Senate, 42 Democrats voted for a nonbinding resolution calling for a ""sustainable expansion of benefits.""Mrs. Clinton has long said she supported increased benefits for the poorest seniors. But on Friday, Mr. Sanders pressured Mrs. Clinton to say whether she would promise not to cut the program. In response, she tweeted, ""I won't cut Social Security. As always, I'll expand it, & I'll defend it.""Mr. Sanders's proposal to eliminate tuition at public colleges has gained steam at a time when many students face heavy debt loads -- now approaching $1.3 trillion, nationally -- and state budget cuts to higher education have driven up tuition. The recession prompted many people to go back to school, and many emerged with heavy payments and few prospects.As recently as 2012, Mr. Obama proposed more modest assistance to college students: lowering rates on federal loans, which he pushed among younger voters during his re-election campaign. Last year, he proposed tuition-free community college, an idea that died in Congress.Liberal groups pitched something bolder: debt-free four-year college, which charged families only what they could afford. Mrs. Clinton backed that idea, but Mr. Sanders took it further and proposed free college altogether. Public college should be free, he said, like high school is.""In the last 30 years, when people say to me, 'Bernie you're coming up with these ambitious ideas. How can you afford them?'"" Mr. Sanders told the crowd at a campaign rally Sunday. ""The answer is in the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the pockets of working families to the top 1/10th of 1%. And we can afford these programs because we're going to transfer some of that wealth back.""Enlarge this image.Credit: By Laura Meckler and Richard Rubin",4/11/16
The Windmills of Bernie's Mind,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762931722?accountid=12768,"Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders in December introduced a sweeping renewable-energy plan that would, among other things, require tens of thousands of new wind turbines. Sen. Sanders's ""people before polluters"" proposal may help rally his followers, but it won't be so well received in rural America, where resistance to wind farms has been building. Nowhere is the backlash stronger than in Mr. Sanders's state.On Jan. 5, Vermont state Sens. John S. Rodgers and Robert Starr, both Democrats, introduced a bill (S. 210) that would ban wind projects above 500 kilowatts (an average industrial wind turbine has a capacity of 1.5 megawatts or more). Twenty-four co-sponsors filed an identical bill in Vermont's lower chamber on Jan. 20.Mr. Rodgers called the growing resistance to wind projects ""a rebellion"" at a news conference in Montpelier, the state capital. ""I know of no place in the state where we can place industrial wind turbines without creating an unacceptable level of damage to our environment and our people.""Wind-generated electricity in the U.S. has more than tripled since 2008, but opposition to the gigantic turbines, which can stand more than 500 feet, has been growing. In Vermont several protesters were arrested in 2011 and 2012 while trying to stop work on a wind project built on top of Lowell Mountain.In March 2015 the Northeastern Vermont Development Association, a regional planning commission that covers 21% of the state's land area, voted unanimously in favor of a resolution that said ""no further development of industrial-scale wind turbines should take place in the Northeast Kingdom.""In October residents of Irasburg overwhelmingly voted down, 274-9, a proposed five-megawatt wind project near their town. In November residents of Swanton met to consider a seven-turbine wind project proposed to be built atop nearby Rocky Ridge. The tally: 731 votes against, 160 in favor. And in December the town select board in Fairfield, a few miles southeast of Swanton, declared its opposition to the same project.Mr. Sanders's target is for the U.S. to get 80% of its energy from renewables by 2050. The plan calls for 25% of Vermont's energy needs to be produced from wind -- a giant expansion. In 2014, according to the American Wind Energy Association, Vermont's 119 megawatts of installed turbine capacity generated about 4% of the electricity produced in the state.Vermont's bill appears to be the first effort by state legislators to outright ban large wind projects, but dozens of governmental entities have rejected or restricted such developments over the past year. In May 2015 commissioners in Stark County, N.D., rejected a $250 million wind project being pushed by Florida-based NextEra Energy, America's biggest wind-energy producer.In July the town board of Somerset, N.Y., voted to oppose a proposed 200-megawatt project known as Lighthouse Wind. And the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a ban on large wind turbines in the county's unincorporated areas.""Wind turbines create visual blight,"" said Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. Skyscraper-size turbines, he added, would ""contradict the county's rural dark skies ordinance which aims to protect dark skies in areas like Antelope Valley and the Santa Monica Mountains.""In Iowa, a three-turbine wind project pushed by a company called Optimum Renewables has been rejected by three different counties, most recently in August by the Black Hawk County Board of Adjustment, after more than 100 local residents expressed concerns.And in December Maine's Partnership for the Preservation of the Downeast Lakes Watershed, a tiny group that had been fighting a $100 million, 40-megawatt project known as Bowers Wind, prevailed when the Maine Supreme Judicial Court upheld a ruling by the state's Board of Environmental Protection, which had previously rejected the project.Why are so many Vermonters opposed to wind energy? The Sanders presidential campaign did not respond to questions. But Sen. Rodgers told me by email that the state must protect its tourism industry. ""People come here from around the world for our scenic vistas and rural working landscape."" Asked whether concerns about climate change should trump the concerns of rural communities, Mr. Rodgers was frank: ""Destroying the natural environment in the name of climate change is moronic.""---Mr. Bryce is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Election 2016: Sanders Tests Hollywood Loyalty --- The senator draws more supporters but has yet to peel off Clinton's big donors,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762931460?accountid=12768,"LOS ANGELES -- Hillary Clinton has richer Hollywood friends, but Bernie Sanders's entertainment-industry supporters are doing what they can to help him win the Democratic presidential nomination.Late last month at the Laugh Factory on the Sunset Strip, a lineup of comedians performed at a fundraiser for Mr. Sanders before a packed audience that included many younger people, a core constituency for the 74-year-old. The event generated a fresh batch of mostly small donations, which has become a bedrock of the insurgent candidacy. The Sanders campaign wouldn't disclose the amount raised from the show, which was streamed online.Mr. Sanders's enthusiastic support among some Hollywood celebrities mirrors the chord he has struck with liberals and younger voters elsewhere. Iowa entrance poll results showed the Vermont senator won 84% of voters under 30. Among those between the ages of 30 and 44, he had 58% support, compared with 37% for Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton managed to eke out a win in Iowa, but the Sanders campaign is relying on similar lopsided margins of support among young voters to help him in New Hampshire on Tuesday.California's primary is deep in the primary calendar, but campaign cash raised here will help Mr. Sanders stay in the race when the terrain shifts to Southern states thought to be more favorable for Mrs. Clinton. In January, Mr. Sanders collected more campaign cash that the party front-runner for the first time. On Friday, the Red Hot Chili Peppers headlined a Los Angeles fundraiser concert for the Sander's campaign.One of the Laugh Factory performers, Sarah Silverman, said she sees parallels between Mr. Sanders and President Barack Obama, whom she supported in 2008 against Mrs. Clinton.Though Mr. Obama is a ""cool-as-a-cucumber speaker"" and ""Bernie has more of a cranky old man vibe,"" she said, ""their spirits are similar in that they engage the people.""However, Mr. Sanders hasn't yet shown Mr. Obama's ability to peel away Hollywood heavy hitters. Mr. Obama, in an early coup, won away two top industry figures, DreamWorks Animation SKG Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and billionaire music mogul David Geffen, on his way to upsetting Mrs. Clinton eight years ago.This year, Mr. Katzenberg is firmly back in the Clinton column, having given $1 million to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing her candidacy.In a recent interview, Mr. Katzenberg said some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters were getting nervous about Mr. Sanders's challenge, but he remains confident she will win the nomination.""This is the time when everyone gets anxious,"" he said. ""And I'm not.""Mr. Geffen, who in 2007 publicly accused the Clintons of being liars, has given each of the two candidates $2,700, the maximum amount an individual can donate directly to a candidate's primary campaign.""I am not supporting anybody,"" he said in an email.Federal election data through the end of 2015 tracked by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics shows the former senator and secretary of state's campaign received nearly $1.9 million from donors in the movie, television and music industries. Mr. Sanders had received $219,000.The comparison is even more lopsided when counting money for super PACs, or independent political-action committees, which Mr. Sanders has eschewed. Priorities USA Action has received $9 million from the entertainment industry. Haim Saban, head of Saban Capital and a longtime television producer and executive, and his wife, Cheryl, gave $5 million. Director Steven Spielberg and Legendary Entertainment Chief Thomas Tull each contributed $1 million, as did J.J. Abrams, director of the recent ""Star Wars"" blockbuster, with his wife, Kathleen McGrath.Still, Mr. Sanders has been finding other sources of money. In last year's fourth quarter, his campaign raised $33.6 million, compared with $37.4 million by Mrs. Clinton's.Laugh Factory founder Jamie Masada said his club is looking at doing another Sanders fundraiser using Latino comedians to target that segment of the electorate.Several of Mr. Sanders's Hollywood supporters have big social-media followings among younger voters. They include actor Ryan Gosling, actor and singer Ezra Miller and rapper Michael ""Killer Mike"" Render.To be sure, Mrs. Clinton has also attracted some Hollywood heavy hitters with youth appeal, such as singer Katy Perry and actress Lena Dunham.---Brody Mullins and Hannah Karp contributed to this article.Credit: By Erich Schwartzel and John R.

"Election 2016 -- Analysis: Clinton, Sanders Pitches: Doer or Dreamer",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762768256?accountid=12768,"Thursday night's Democratic debate in New Hampshire was the clearest illustration yet of how the party's presidential race is now defined: It is a battle between a doer and a dreamer.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton portrays herself as the doer. She stressed her experience, her desire to set achievable goals and her ability to work the system successfully to achieve them. There are limits to what can be done, she seemed to be saying, and it is better to work all the way to those limits rather than play Don Quixote, tilting at windmills, and ultimately fail.""Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do,"" she said. ""A progressive is someone who makes progress. That's what I intend to do.""Sen. Bernie Sanders plays the role of the dreamer. If the system sets limits, he argued, don't accept the limits, but instead smash the system.Wage a political ""revolution"" -- a word he uses without reservation, and repeatedly -- for government-guaranteed health care for all, for free college education, for a giant leap in the minimum wage.And he has a simple unifying theory of why this all hasn't happened already: a ""corrupt"" campaign-finance system that allows corporate interests who would lose in a changed world to stand in the way. Change campaign finance and all becomes possible.""What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors,"" he said. ""When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.""The sheer simplicity of the Sanders message is what gives it its greatest appeal to frustrated older voters and idealistic younger ones. Yet it also was clear Thursday night that the simplicity of it also is what exasperates Mrs. Clinton.She described herself more as a battle-scarred veteran who has learned the hard way that it is best to do the work without, as she said, ""making promises that I cannot keep.""So her goal is to make college more affordable, not to promise that it can be free. She wants to expand and improve the health-care law known as Obamacare, not toss it aside in pursuit of some dubious goal of Medicare for all.At one point she argued that she has the ability to work together with Republicans and independents to achieve such things: ""We'll get things done together.""Mr. Sanders said his approach wouldn't be to negotiate compromise with, say, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell but rather to bring an army of citizens to his doorstep to make him accept their demands.""No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell,"" he said. ""Mitch is going to have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, 'Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.' ""The Sanders approach seemed to put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive during the first part of the debate. But the tables turned later, when the discussion turned to national security, as she painted his approach as not idealistic but rather dangerously naive.That area is where she, as the nation's former top foreign-policy cabinet official, is the more nimble candidate.She argued that it is a mistake to suppose, as Mr. Sanders has suggested, that it would be acceptable to invite Iranian troops into Syria to help police put an end to the civil war there, or to fully normalize relations with Iran more broadly.""If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior,"" she said. Better to ""take this step by step to try to rein in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.""On that front, she got Mr. Sanders to argue that he, too, could be realistic, and that he was talking of normalizing relations eventually, not immediately.Overall, though, Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire and beyond have two quite different approaches to choose between: a candidate who stresses achievement and one who prefers aspirations.Credit: By Gerald F.

Democrats' Fight Intensifies as New York Primary Nears; Clinton says Sanders has struggled under media scrutiny; he emphasizes opposition to fracking,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780026585?accountid=12768,"Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton ripped into presidential rival Bernie Sanders on Monday, saying he has been unable to answer questions about his key policies, while he played up his opposition to fracking in a state where the practice has been banned.Speaking to reporters, Mrs. Clinton suggested that Mr. Sanders had withered under the media scrutiny in New York, which holds its primary April 19 and a debate this week.""I have noticed that under the bright spotlight and scrutiny here in New York, Sen. Sanders has had trouble answering questions,"" she said at a stop in Queens. ""He's had trouble answering questions about his core issue, namely dealing with the banks. He's had trouble answering foreign-policy questions. So I look forward to a debate that is in New York with people asking the kinds of questions that New Yorkers ask.""Aides to Mr. Sanders didn't respond to a request for comment on Mrs. Clinton's remarks.Mr. Sanders, addressing a packed, raucous rally in Albany, harshly went after his opponent for her Wall Street ties, and mocked her six-figure speeches to financial firms. ""Not a bad day's work,"" the Vermont senator said.His campaign also released a TV ad highlighting his opposition to the fossil fuel extraction technology known as fracking.Polls show Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Sanders in her adopted home state. She had support of 55% of likely Democratic primary voters in New York, compared with 41% for Mr. Sanders, in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Monday. She is also far ahead of him in delegates. But she showed no signs of coasting, hitting Mr. Sanders from several angles over the span of just a few hours.At a forum on gun violence in Port Washington on Long Island, she targeted his opposition to some gun restrictions and dismissed his defense that gun control is unpopular among his constituents in rural Vermont.""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state,"" she said. ""And the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""The campaign cited data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs replied by pointing to comments from Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, in response to similar Clinton comments, that New York cannot blame its crime problems on Vermont. ""I don't know why Secretary Clinton would be so critical of the governor of Vermont who strongly supports her candidacy,"" Mr. Briggs said in a statement.Earlier in the day, Mrs. Clinton held a round-table discussion at the Jackson Diner, an Indian restaurant in Queens. The venue and her companions--natives of Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Indonesia and Afghanistan--appeared chosen to represent the diversity of New York's Queens borough. She used the setting to swipe at Republican Donald Trump, who she said was born in Queens but doesn't respect the diversity that makes it strong.Much of Mrs. Clinton's attention was trained on Mr. Sanders, who continues to mount a vigorous challenge for the Democratic nomination. She pointed to a recent Sanders interview with the New York Daily News where he struggled to answer some questions and said, ""Sen. Sanders couldn't even answer questions about whatever his [Wall Street] plan is.""Mrs. Clinton also tossed in a dismissive comment about the Sanders campaign when talking about reports of Sanders supporters pressuring Clinton backers. ""There seems to be a growing level of anxiety in that campaign, which I hope doesn't spill over into the way that his supporters treat other people, who have every right to support whomever they chose,"" she said.Still, Mrs. Clinton made clear that she isn't pressuring Mr. Sanders to leave the race. ""Let's remember, I went all the way to the end in 2008 and I'm not making any comment about how hard anybody competes. I'm for a good, tough contest,"" she said.Earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders's campaign went after Mrs. Clinton on the issue of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, pointing to supportive comments she made about the process while secretary of state. He also repeated his call for a nationwide ban on the practice, which is used to extract natural gas and oil from deep in the ground and which is opposed by many environmental activists.At the rally in Albany on Monday, Mr. Sanders described the issue as one where he and Mrs. Clinton have ""very significant differences"" but he didn't detail them as he explained his own opposition to the practice.He also released a new TV ad focused on the issue.""Do Washington politicians side with polluters over families?"" actress Susan Sarandon asked in the spot. ""They sure do, because Big Oil pumps millions into their campaigns. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate for president who opposes fracking everywhere.""The Clinton campaign also released a new TV spot on Monday focused on Mr. Trump. She highlights some of Mr. Trump's most controversial comments--on Mexicans, Muslims and abortion--as a way of pumping up support for her among Democrats who are offended by him.""Donald Trump says we can solve America's problems by turning against each other. It's wrong, and it goes against everything New York and America stand for,"" Mrs. Clinton says in the spot. An announcer adds: ""With so much at stake, she's the one tough enough to stop Trump.""Mr. Trump said in a statement: ""The ad is a lie...I look so forward to winning the Republican nomination so I can aim my firepower at her. She will be easier to beat than any of the people I have already taken down.""Byron Tau and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler",4/12/16

Six percent said none of the candidates was a real New Yorker, while 5% were unsure, the poll found .Still, Mr. Trump is struggling for support among registered voters in Democratic-heavy New York City. In a hypothetical matchup, Mrs. Clinton beats him 78% to 17% in the five boroughs.When likely Democratic primary voters were asked to choose between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders on the real New Yorker question, 42% chose Mrs. Clinton and 39% picked Mr. Sanders.Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have been trying to play up their New York ties.

Bernie Sanders Ups Anti-Clinton Rhetoric; Senator says his rival's husband's presidency imposed hardships on African-Americans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779789398?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--A new rift in the Democratic race has opened up, with Bernie Sanders making the case that Bill Clinton's two-term presidency was harmful to the African-American voters who are among the most loyal groups in the Clinton family's political base.The Vermont senator is vying to win over African-American voters in advance of the April 19 New York primary, and is seizing on a dust-up last week between the husband of his rival, Hillary Clinton, and a pair of protesters over crime and social-welfare policies dating back to the 1990s.Mr. Sanders's campaign also released a new TV ad produced by movie director Spike Lee that will air soon in New York. The ad features entertainer Harry Belafonte and civil-rights activists vouching for Mr. Sanders as someone who is sensitive to the struggles of racial and religious minorities.Targeting Mr. Clinton carries certain perils. Polls show the 42nd president is popular among Democrats, and he enjoyed a particular bond with African-Americans during his time in office. And Mrs. Clinton has, in the primaries so far, carried overwhelming majorities of the African-American vote, with Mr. Sanders heavily dependent on white voters.But racial politics are shifting, breaking along similar generational lines that have left Mrs. Clinton garnering more support from older women voters than younger ones.Both of the Clintons have been on the defensive over tough-on-crime policies enacted when he was president. Hoping to expand his coalition, Mr. Sanders is advancing the argument that the Clinton presidential years imposed certain hardships on African-Americans.In the exchange with protesters in Philadelphia on Thursday, Mr. Clinton defended his wife's use of the term ""super predator"" in a 1996 speech as an apt description for gang leaders preying on black neighborhoods. (She has apologized in the past for using the term.) Mr. Clinton also sought to justify signing a welfare overhaul that same year that imposed new work requirements and limitations on federal assistance.Speaking at a campaign event at the Apollo Theater in Harlem over the weekend, Mr. Sanders called on Mr. Clinton to apologize for defending her use of the term.When someone in the audience at the Apollo shouted that the ""super predator"" reference was code for ""black people,"" Mr. Sanders said: ""That's exactly right.""Mr. Sanders was unsparing in his criticism of the welfare legislation, casting it as a cynical ploy to win votes. ""Do you all remember that?"" he asked the audience. ""The premise, which was a right-wing Republican premise, was that the problem was all these people were really living high off the hog."" A consequence of the new law, he said, was that ""extreme poverty...went up.""Mr. Clinton did his part to help boost black turnout for his wife, visiting a trio of African-American churches on Sunday. He stressed his affection for Harlem--where he opened his personal office after leaving the White House--during a stop at the Abyssinian Baptist Church. He recalled that in trips to New York he would ""go by the old Cotton Club and I'd come back to the Apollo (Theater)....In my imagination I always thought I'd become a jazz musician."" The crowd laughed, according to a pool report.Asked about the welfare law Sunday following a rally in Queens, Mr. Clinton said: ""There's no question, as every independent analysis has shown, it led to a big drop in poverty. It's just that the people who were left should never have been abandoned, but it happened essentially after I left office.""No candidate wants a surrogate to dominate the discussion. But Mr. Clinton has always cast a large shadow over his wife's political ambitions. Stumping on her behalf he routinely talks up her credentials, but he is also eager to discuss his own record, presenting it as a model for helping people across the spectrum improve their financial condition. He follows the race closely and occasionally mixes it up with his wife's rivals.During a debate in the 2008 campaign, then-Sen. Barack Obama complained about Mr. Clinton's campaign tactics. ""I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes,"" Mr. Obama told Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders, too, seems vexed by the former president.Last week, Mr. Sanders questioned whether the former secretary of state was ""qualified"" to be president, comments he later backed off. Asked by a reporter if Mr. Sanders would have said that about a male candidate with a similar resume, Mr. Clinton said: ""Well, of course it wouldn't happen.""He added: ""I think there are some different standards for women. Some of them are subconscious.""In a CNN interview that aired Sunday Mr. Sanders was asked about those comments. ""Well, I appreciate Bill Clinton being my psychoanalyst. It's always nice,"" he said.For her part, Mrs. Clinton gave no indication that she is about to rein in her husband as he campaigns on her behalf.She told CNN that ""he does take defending me and protecting me very seriously, and I appreciate that.""Erica Orden contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",4/12/16
Bernie Sees Panama Red; The 2011 U.S. trade deal enhanced tax transparency.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780010814?accountid=12768,"When you're a protectionist hammer, everything looks like a free-trade agreement to pound. So it shouldn't surprise that Bernie Sanders is using the disclosures in the Panama Papers to assail the 2011 U.S.-Panama trade accord for making secret bank accounts possible. As usual, the Vermont socialist has it backward.""What the Panamanian free-trade agreement did is enable large corporations and the wealthiest people--not just in this country but around the world--to participate in massive tax-avoidance schemes,"" Mr. Sanders said in Philadelphia Thursday.But there is no evidence to support his claim, and the opposite seems to be true. U.S. tax law requires confidentiality regarding requests that the U.S. might make of foreign governments. But what we do know is that U.S. negotiators made the signing of a separate bilateral tax agreement with Panama a condition for signing the larger trade deal. It was ratified by Panama ahead of the trade deal.This tax accord is known as a tax information exchange agreement, and it essentially obliges the two governments to share tax information, a practice that helps track down tax evaders. As the Obama Treasury puts it, these agreements ""increase transparency between the U.S. and financial centers around the world.""By the way, U.S. goods exports to Panama increased from 2012-2014, though last year they fell below the 2011 total in part due to a slowdown in Panama's economy. The deal also gives U.S. businesses access to Panama's $20.6 billion market in services. All of which is to say that the Panama free-trade deal is a net benefit for the U.S. even if it doesn't fit Bernie's political narrative.",4/13/16

Mr. Sanders has said he opposed the 2007 bill because of the details of a guest-worker program that was included and that the minutemen bill simply codified existing law.She has long been on the defense over her ties to Wall Street, but on Monday she pointed to the Daily News interview in trying to turn the issue against Mr. Sanders. ""Sen. Sanders couldn't even answer questions about whatever his plan is,"" she said.Mrs. Clinton also tossed in a dismissive comment about the Sanders campaign when talking about reports of Sanders supporters pressuring Clinton backers.""There seems to be a growing level of anxiety in that campaign, which I hope doesn't spill over into the way that his supporters treat other people who have every right to support whomever they chose,"" she said.She added that she's ahead in the popular vote total as well as in the race for pledged delegates. She didn't mention superdelegates, who can vote for whoever they choose. Sanders supporters have been pressuring Clinton superdelegates to switch sides .Still, she made clear that she isn't pressuring Mr. Sanders to leave the race.

"Campaign 2016: Not Servicing National Debt; Promises by Trump, Cruz, Sanders all raise prospects of more red ink, outside experts say",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779945954?accountid=12768,"As part of Donald Trump's effort to move his presidential quest from insurrection into a more-conventional campaign, he is considering making some serious speeches that would put more meat on his skeletal policy proposals. One possibility to consider: reconciling his wildly conflicting signals on the national debt.In a nutshell, here is the disconnect: Mr. Trump has said he can eliminate the $19 trillion federal debt in eight years. At the same time, he has proposed a giant tax-cut plan that the conservative Tax Foundation says would, even after accounting for the economic growth it would create, reduce government revenues by $10 trillion over the next decade.Taken together, that's a hole of some $30 trillion to fill--and actually more, considering the debt would continue to climb in the interim. Add in promises not to touch Social Security and Medicare benefits and to build up the military, and the task is nearly impossible.For perspective, the entire federal budget for nondefense discretionary spending--programs outside of entitlement programs and interest on the debt--now runs about $600 billion annually. You would have to eliminate every penny of that spending--on roads, education, law enforcement and scientific research--for 25 years to fill that hole.Or, alternately, as the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, you would have to cut all government spending outside of Social Security by 93%.This disconnect is symptomatic of a broader failure of the 2016 campaign debate to seriously engage on questions of deficit and debt.Before going further, a bit of a primer is required. The federal deficit is the amount of money the federal government spends each year over and above its revenues. Borrowing makes up the difference. The debt is the total accumulated over years of such borrowing.To pay down the debt, you would need to not only balance the budget but create a surplus to be able to buy up all the old debt--an idea that many economists say would create its own economic shocks.Mr. Trump's main Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, brings some of the same disconnects to this issue, simply on a smaller scale. While Mr. Cruz proposes passing a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that his economic proposals--which combine a big tax cut with increased military spending, the end of Affordable Care Act taxes and much smaller domestic spending cuts--would increase the national debt by $12.5 trillion over the next decade. To put that in perspective, the debt has risen about $9 trillion during the course of the Obama presidency.On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders outbids everybody on both spending and tax increases--and would add to the debt. He proposes raising the rates across personal tax brackets, establishing a top federal tax rate of 54.2% and boosting taxes on capital gains.While all that would pay for some of his expanded social spending, which would drive up federal spending by an estimated 33%, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget still estimates that his plan would add somewhere between $2 trillion and $15 trillion to the federal debt, depending on how much his plan for national health insurance would end up costing.In terms of debt management, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Hillary Clinton are the most responsible. Her programs would increase federal spending by an estimated 2%, and she proposes tax increases to pay for them. The Tax Foundation estimates that her proposals for tax increases would raise $498 billion in federal revenue over a decade--though it also estimates those tax increases would decrease the gross domestic product by 1% in the long run by suppressing economic activity.This all should be grist for a detailed campaign discussion, because the economic stakes are enormous. But it isn't, in part because many voters have stopped taking seriously plans put forth by political figures of all stripes. Who can blame them? Washington has become the capital of dysfunction, where even the most well-crafted policy proposals go to die.So the pressure on, say, Mr. Trump to explain his ideas has been minimal. When pressed, he has talked about closing the gap by going after waste in the Social Security system and elsewhere, but such savings would pale beside the task of finding some $30 trillion in deficit and debt reduction. Some advisers have suggested selling federal assets, but the Financial Statement of the United States Government shows that the government's total assets amount to $3.1 trillion. Mr. Trump has said renegotiating trade deals would lower the deficit, though the amount of government revenue from trade is small.Which leaves roaring economic growth to generate more revenue.

"Sanders Says U.S. Helped Panama as a Tax Haven But Skips Over Tax Pact; Track record of 2011 tax accord is murky, but experts say such deals generally help with getting information on tax evasion",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779259586?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders said Washington put its seal of approval on Panama's tax-haven status, but he avoided mentioning a key effort officials made to crack down on secret offshore holdings.""What the Panamanian free-trade agreement did is enable large corporations and the wealthiest people--not just in this country but around the world--to participate in massive tax-avoidance schemes,"" Mr. Sanders said at a labor event Thursday in Philadelphia. ""I was on the floor of the United States Senate in opposition to the Panama free-trade agreement for precisely that reason.""An Obama administration official said Mr. Sanders's argument has ""zero merit.""The full story is more complex. Democrats used the 2011 free-trade agreement as leverage to force Panama to agree to a separate tax accord, which was aimed at improving taxpayer disclosure and discouraging secretive offshore holdings--at least those of U.S. investors. Mr. Sanders voted against the U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement, citing concerns about Panama's status as a tax haven.More on Panama Papers* France Wants Details From Its Banks on Tax Havens* Panama Papers Scandal Claims Austrian Bank Head, Norwegian Chemical Company* Panama Papers: A History of Tax Evasion from Ancient Rome to the French Revolution to 19th-Century New JerseyThe fresh flurry of interest in Panama comes after a group of journalists around the world released a series of reports on offshore dealings based on records from a giant law firm in Panama, Mossack Fonseca. The firm, which denies wrongdoing , appeared to establish and help manage offshore holdings linked to senior officials around the globe, with some clients engaging in practices resembling asset seizure or money laundering, according to the news reports. The contents of the records couldn't be independently confirmed.Mr. Sanders sought to connect the individuals linked to offshore schemes in Panama to companies' efforts to avoid taxes in the U.S. and other countries. President Barack Obama made that connection this week after his administration cracked down on so-called inversions, transactions in which corporations move their headquarters overseas to lower their tax burden.""What I was concerned about then, and what turned out to be true, is that that trade agreement will give large corporations in this country--and, in fact, corporations around the world--a capability of avoiding paying taxes to their own governments,"" Mr. Sanders said.Whether the 2011 tax agreement has been successful is murky, largely because of a different kind of secrecy: U.S. tax law bars the government from both discussing individual taxpayers and requests made under tax treaties.Although the government can't provide data on the nature and number of its contacts with Panama under the tax accord, current and former U.S. officials say tax-information exchange agreements in general have been useful for obtaining evidence in tax-evasion investigations.More on Election 2016* Sanders Questions if Clinton Is Qualified to Be President* Clinton Endures Subway Crush to Win New York Votes* Trump's Delegate Czar Gets Bigger Role* Veterans' Charities Await Funds Raised by Trump* Rudy Giuliani Says He'll Vote For, But Not Endorse, TrumpOn Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass) and another Senate Democrat asked the Treasury Department to investigate any U.S. companies that had used the Panamanian law firm.""The U.S. has led the charge in combating international tax evasion using offshore financial accounts and is supportive of [Tax Information Exchange Agreements], which increase transparency between the U.S. and financial centers around the world,"" a Treasury spokeswoman said.Still, the issue of secrecy was raised earlier this week by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D., Texas), who said in a written statement that he ""reluctantly voted for the FTA, feeling that we made at least some progress"" on the tax agreement and a Panamanian law to crack down on ""bearer shares,"" which allow stakes in companies to be exchanged via physical certificates without informing authorities. He added: ""Once the FTA was approved, it is unclear what the administration has done to ensure compliance.""Former Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), who spent years investigating offshore tax evasion through the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and was a top proponent of the Panama trade pact, said: ""We know that the only way that you can nail tax evaders and avoiders is if you can get information. And the only way you are going to be able to get information from tax havens like Panama is if there is an agreement reached that they will give you information.""Tax experts say the deal likely helped a bit with bilateral tax issues with Panama.""By putting this in place they have a better opportunity--if they get wind of something--to go looking for it,"" said Catherine Schultz, vice president for tax policy at the National Foreign Trade Council in Washington.As for the underlying trade agreement with Panama, it has had little effect on trade in goods between the two countries, which totaled just $8.2 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau . That is down from $8.6 billion in 2011, the year before the agreement went into effect.Still, U.S. officials cite another outcome of the trade agreement: increased access to Panama's financial-services market.Write to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.comCredit: By William Mauldin and Aruna Viswanatha",4/13/16

Verizon's Political Strike; Sanders and Clinton join picket lines on behalf of the rotary-phone era.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780668568?accountid=12768,"As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders chase each other further to the left, it was only a matter of time before somebody decided to capitalize on their competition. The Democrats have now helped inspire the largest domestic strike in years--and it's pure political performance art.On Wednesday, more than 36,000 Verizon workers on the East Coast walked off the job after their unions rejected the telecom's latest contract offer in a 10-month negotiation. The Communication Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers wanted a public spectacle, and did they ever get one.Mr. Sanders joined a picket line in Brooklyn and began, ""Brothers and sisters, thank you for your courage and standing up for justice against corporate greed."" He went on to accuse Verizon of ""trying to destroy the lives of working Americans,"" and that was the subtle part. Mrs. Clinton demanded that the company ""do the right thing"" and tender ""a fair offer to their workers.""The Democrats are not exactly Bobby Kennedy communing with Cesar Chavez and destitute grape pickers. How's this for ""fair""? The walk-offs enjoy an average annual pay and benefits package of $130,000. Management is offering a 6.5% cash wage increase, the same health coverage as its other domestic employees and an industry-competitive 401(k) match.Yet Verizon and the unions have largely agreed about compensation. The unions preferred to make a political statement about expanding the ranks of the Americans lucky enough to have decent-paying jobs, which apparently means showing solidarity with an increasingly obsolete business model.Some 99% of the strikers work for Verizon's legacy ""wireline"" business, or its traditional fixed phone service plus its fiber optic Internet service. This unit generates only 7% of Verizon operating income, down from 60% in 2000--wireless is more profitable--and as more customers ditch land lines, it is only natural that these old-fashioned networks will require fewer workers to operate and maintain.But Verizon isn't even looking to shed jobs. It is merely seeking more flexibility to manage its workforce, such as consolidating under-used call centers and the ability to hire more outside contractors. ""Nostalgia for the rotary-phone era won't save American jobs,"" Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam wrote in a LinkedIn post.Mr. McAdam also called Mr. Sanders's rhetoric ""contemptible,"" publishing a detailed rebuttal. Credit is due to the rare executive willing to defend economic reality and stand up to political intimidation.",4/14/16
Notable & Quotable: Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam; On Bernie Sanders's 'outrageous' views about big corporations.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780637596?accountid=12768,"From a LinkedIn post by Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam, April 13:I read with interest Jeff Immelt's spirited response to Sen. Bernie Sanders putting GE on his hitlist of big corporations that are ""destroying the moral fabric"" of America.In fact, I feel his pain. Verizon is in Sanders's bull's-eye, as well. The senator's uninformed views are, in a word, outrageous. Here's why.His first accusation--that Verizon doesn't pay its fair share of taxes--is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we've paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years--that's a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who's counting. . . . The senator has started to fudge his language--talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified ""given year""--but that doesn't make his contention any less false.Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn't use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure--virtually all of it in the U.S.--and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock.",4/14/16
"After Hillary Beats Bernie, She'll Need Him; Clinton may be uninspiring, but her competence could be what 2016 voters want.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780342571?accountid=12768,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, and there is nothing that Sen. Bernie Sanders can do about it.The Vermont senator's campaign is reportedly planning an all-out assault on the democratic legitimacy of the party's 712 superdelegates, who make up about 15% of the total. But on what basis? As of today, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders by 250 among delegates won in primaries and caucuses. She has received 2.4 million more popular votes than he has. A recent synthesis of exit polls shows that of 27 demographic categories, Mr. Sanders has the edge in three. Despite his recent winning streak, she has prevailed in more states, and his string of victories has narrowed her edge by only 79 delegates.That's the good news for Mr. Sanders, and it is about to end. Between now and the end of April, Democrats will hold primaries in six states--New York, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Unless a late Sanders surge reverses Mrs. Clinton's lead, she will win the majority--perhaps all--of these states, and her lead among delegates and in the popular vote will expand significantly. By the end of April, she will have upward of 90% of the delegates she needs to claim the nomination.The pace of the campaign slows significantly in May, with fewer than 200 delegates at stake. Unless Mr. Sanders wipes her out on June 7 in California and New Jersey--and there is no evidence that he will--she will end the nominating contest with more than enough delegates to claim victory, including a majority of delegates earned in primaries and caucuses as well as a margin of millions in the popular vote.So how exactly will the Sanders forces make the case that Mrs. Clinton's nomination would violate the people's will?Recently, Mr. Sanders has been arguing that he would make a stronger general-election candidate, and he has a fair amount of survey evidence to back his claim. But using this argument to sway the superdelegates would be an appeal to their judgment, not to democratic legitimacy.Besides, it won't work. Democrats who have been around the track a few times understand that while Mrs. Clinton has been subjected to unrelenting scrutiny for a quarter of a century, Mr. Sanders's record has been left virtually untouched. The Clinton campaign has been reluctant to antagonize voters whose support they will need in the general election, and Republicans are holding their fire in the vain hope that they will have the opportunity to run against Mr. Sanders in the fall.The real question is how well Mrs. Clinton will do in November. The answer depends on a few things she can control and many more that she cannot. She can try--within limits--to placate Mr. Sanders's backers at the nominating convention. She could decide to choose a populist-tinged figure--Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, for example--as her running mate. If the Democrats emerge from their convention unified and energized, Mrs. Clinton's fall prospects will rise--all the more so if Mr. Sanders campaigns vigorously on her behalf.Because every presidential election comes down to a choice, the identity of the Republican nominee will make a big difference. Although Donald Trump is the ultimate wild card, there is no evidence that he would prevail in a general election. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is focused, strategic and well-organized, but his hard-edge conservatism would make it difficult for him to expand his support beyond his party's base. Ohio Gov. John Kasich runs well ahead of Mrs. Clinton in national surveys, but rank-and-file Republicans appear in no mood to nominate someone from their party's moderate-conservative wing.Mrs. Clinton is not a visionary, and her candidacy has done little to inspire Democrats not already committed to her. She is cautious and self-controlled, not a risk-taker. By her own admission, she is not a natural politician. Contradicting Mario Cuomo's famous maxim, she campaigns in prose.On the other hand, few have ever questioned her intelligence or work ethic. She understands how politics and policy-making really work. She believes that political leaders should under-promise and over-perform--an eminently defensible thesis in this era of rock-bottom public trust.In most democracies, the head of government is separate from the head of state. In the U.S., they are fused in a single office. Our presidents are called on to perform both as prime ministers and as symbols of the nation. Rarely are they equally skilled at both tasks.Hillary Clinton has the qualities of a first-rate prime minister. At a time when the American people are yearning for an end to political dysfunction and a return to government that works effectively on their behalf, what she offers will probably be enough to prevail in November.Credit: By William A.

"SEC Alleges 'Ponzi-Like' Fraud at Ski Resort Praised by Sanders, Other Politicians; Sens. Bernie Sanders, Patrick Leahy saw company as helping corner of Vermont through visa program",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781242632?accountid=12768,"A Vermont ski resort accused of ""Ponzi-like"" fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission had been championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and other politicians as a way of helping to revitalize a northern corner of the state.The SEC on Thursday filed a civil lawsuit alleging a ""massive eight-year fraudulent scheme"" involving a series of real-estate developments by Jay Peak ski resort and a federal program known as EB-5 that offers green cards to foreign investors.Mr. Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, had praised the resort's use of the EB-5 program, as did Sen. Patrick Leahy and Gov. Peter Shumlin, both Democrats, and other politicians.The Sanders campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.Mr. Leahy said in a statement Thursday that he was ""shocked and saddened"" by what investigators had found. ""I have supported the EB-5 Regional Center Program because it can generate significant investment and create real jobs in rural areas...But there is no question that the program is in dire need of reform,"" he said. At a Friday news conference, Mr. Leahy said the charges could help persuade lawmakers to support changes to the EB-5 program.Vermont's financial regulation department also sued the resort and two of its executives, alleging violations of state fraud laws. Mr. Shumlin said at a Thursday news conference announcing the case: ""We all feel betrayed.""""The dream that we could finally create hundreds and hundreds of jobs in a part of the state that has been struggling for jobs, is something that any reasonable person would wish to pursue...obviously this is an extraordinary disappointment,"" the governor said, according to a video of the news conference posted on the Burlington Free Press website.In an interview Friday, the top federal prosecutor in Vermont, Eric Miller, said his was investigating ""whether or not there have been any violations of federal criminal law in connection with the EB-5 projects in the Northeast Kingdom.""Messrs. Sanders and Leahy had attended a 2012 news conference during which Jay Peak announced more than $500 million in EB-5 investments, according to news reports at the time. The announcement came days after President Barack Obama signed a three-year extension of the visa program, which Mr. Leahy helped usher through.""Perhaps the most important reasons I support this program are standing right here in this room,"" Mr. Leahy spoke at the 2012 event, identifying three executives from the company by name, among others, according to remarks posted on his website.Mr. Sanders also praised the program at the 2012 news conference: ""The most popular sport in America is complaining about the federal government. What you are seeing here is a marriage and partnership between private business and federal, state and local government.""Jay Peak; its owner, Ariel Quiros; and its president, William Stenger, ""systematically looted"" more than $50 million of $350 million raised from foreign investors to fund various projects, the SEC said in a lawsuit filed in federal court . It described the scheme as ""Ponzi-like"" and said new investors' funds were being used to fund deficits on earlier projects. The court on Thursday froze the company's assets and appointed a receiver to control its funds.Mr. Stenger previously told a Vermont news website, vtdigger.org , that he had followed the terms of his agreement with investors and said he apologized for poorly communicating with them.A lawyer identified by the SEC as defense counsel in the case didn't respond to requests for comment Friday.Messrs. Quiros and Stenger couldn't immediately be reached for comment.Mr. Quiros has given $30,000 to the Vermont State Democratic Committee since 2012, according to public records.Jay Peak posted a notice on its website that said its day-to-day operations wouldn't be affected by the investigation .The SEC accused Mr. Quiros, 58 years old, of misappropriating the funds to finance $22 million of his purchase of the resort, back a personal line of credit and purchase a $2.2 million luxury condo at Trump Place in New York, among other uses. Mr. Quiros also used $4.2 million to pay the company's income taxes, the SEC said. The lawsuit accuses Mr. Stenger, 66, of helping facilitate that misappropriation by improperly moving funds and creating a ""web of transfers"" to hide that projects were subsequently experiencing shortfalls.At the Friday news conference, Mr. Leahy said he considered Mr. Stenger a friend and said he was disappointed by the allegations.Mr. Leahy ""has no real relationship with Mr. Quiros and has met him only briefly on a few occasions,"" a spokeswoman for the senator said.Investors had been told their funds would be used only to finance one of six projects related to the ski resort, or for the creation of a biomedical research center, the SEC said.The purported $110 million center appears to be ""nearly a complete fraud,"" the SEC said. Investors have provided nearly three-quarters of the funds, and the men claimed in offering documents in 2012 and 2013 that they were in the process of obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval for certain products, but hadn't actually begun the process and haven't submitted any products for FDA review, the SEC said.The SEC said the two men continued to travel to solicit new investors, including in the last few months to Vietnam, Dubai, Istanbul, Hong Kong, Singapore and South America, without mentioning the ""significant shortfall in funds"" they need to finish the research facility.The SEC said it is seeking financial penalties and a return of profits, in addition to court orders on the two man that bar them from some activities.Write to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.comCredit: By Aruna Viswanatha",4/15/16

But both supported the landmark 1994 law that critics say helped foster the system they now attack.The eruption of the 22-year-old crime law into the 2016 presidential campaign highlights a striking shift in the nation's priorities and political landscape over the past two decades. That is creating particular challenges for Mrs. Clinton, the spouse of a president who approved the law two decades ago.""I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and have had a very unfortunate impact on peoples' lives,"" Mrs. Clinton said during Thursday's Democratic debate in New York.Mr. Sanders said during the debate that ""what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.""A testy exchange in Philadelphia recently between President Bill Clinton and a protester from the Black Lives Matter movement highlighted the issue. The protester blamed the crime law for the rise in incarceration, primarily of young black men, that critics say has left millions of people struggling to recover economically and socially.Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said anger over the criminal justice system's impact on minority communities is well-placed. ""We've sort of blithely gone along all these years and let our prison population get bigger and bigger, and the impact has been felt most acutely by communities of color, particularly African-American men,"" said Mr. Travis, who directed the Justice Department's research arm in the Clinton years.But Mr. Travis said it is simplistic to blame Mr. Clinton and the 1994 crime bill for the growth in the prison population. ""I am not sure there is a singular villain in this drama,"" he said.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Clinton, Sanders Hit Hard in New York Debate* Hill Republicans to Bolster Trump's Delegate Push* Candidates Court New York Republicans* Poll: Clinton Leads Sanders in New York by 17 PointsFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who pushed for even tougher measures at the time, said the environment was completely different in the early 1990s. ""It's easy to forget what was going on,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Look at the current Chicago shooting and murder rate--that was across the whole country."" Chicago has recently seen a jump in homicides.Mr. Gingrich, a Republican, defended Mr. Clinton's initial response to the Philadelphia protester, in which he pointed out that many of the crime wave's victims were black. ""The people being killed in Philadelphia and New York were overwhelmingly minorities,"" Mr. Gingrich said.The term ""super-predator"" also entered the lexicon at the time, describing a group of young people who ostensibly were particularly remorseless. Many have since questioned the concept, and Mrs. Clinton recently expressed regret for using the term.The issue is becoming especially heated as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders appeal for minority votes. But the Clinton crime bill was only one of the era's tough laws spawned by fear of crime. By 1994, the prison population was already growing, in part because of changes to state laws that increased the severity of sentences.Congress had also enacted laws with a similar impact, including the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which abolished parole in the federal system, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which created mandatory minimum drug sentences.From 1980 to 1993, according to Justice Department estimates, the total corrections population--those on probation, parole, in state and federal prisons or in jail--rose from 1.8 million to 4.9 million. The prison population alone nearly tripled, to 969,300 from 329,800.That reflected the national mood. By 1994 the nation was inundated with news footage of yellow crime-scene tape, blanket-covered bodies and grieving families, primarily in inner-city minority neighborhoods, as battles erupted over control of the crack cocaine trade.The FBI estimated that over 72,000 people, nearly half of them African-American, were murdered between 1991 and 1993. Politically, ""soft on crime"" became an epithet to be avoided at all costs.In contrast, the past two decades have seen plummeting crime rates, along with the rise of competing national priorities, especially terrorism and the economy. At the same time, black leaders, and officeholders across the political spectrum, have become alarmed at the high incarceration rate and at relations between police and minorities.As a result, the view is now widespread among Democrats and liberals that the 1994 law was deeply flawed.Ronald Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore School of Law, said the legislation had attracted a clash of competing interests, creating ""this ill-considered parade of ideas often not vetted through the committees of jurisdiction."" Mr. Weich was then counsel to Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), a key player on criminal justice issues who supported the final measure.The finished product had good and bad points, Mr. Weich said, and Mr. Clinton urgently sought its passage as he headed into tough midterm elections. ""President Clinton needed a crime bill,"" Mr. Weich said. ""His health care bill was failing in separate committees of the Congress.""Mr. Clinton wanted 100,000 more police officers on the street. Democrats including Mr. Kennedy sought gun-control provisions. Republicans wanted stiffer penalties. Then-Sen. Joe Biden (D., Del.) and others championed the Violence Against Women Act.Many of these provisions, including an assault-weapons ban, became part of the crime law, as did a measure giving some sentencing relief to minor participants in drug enterprises.But the law also created new criminal offenses and expanded the federal death penalty. More significantly, it provided grants for states that required prisoners serve more time by reducing parole and early release, an approach supporters called ""truth in sentencing.""More than two dozen states and the District of Columbia changed their laws as a result, said Thomas Blomberg, dean of the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University. ""The 1994 crime bill facilitated the continued growth in the use of prison by providing major funding for new prison construction,"" he said.Rep. Bobby Scott (D., Va.) supported certain parts of the law but opposed it overall. While the 1986 mandatory minimum law was the catalyst for today's incarceration rate, he said, the 1994 bill continued the trend.""On balance, it was a lock-em-up bill,"" he said.Twenty-two years later, the effect of the period's tough-on-crime laws can be measured in a variety of ways. The Justice Mapping Center and others have assessed the impact of high incarceration rates on specific neighborhoods and how it increased social costs for families.One of the most recent comprehensive looks at incarceration, ""The Growth of Incarceration in the United States"" by the National Research Council, the operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences, in 2014 confirmed that criminal justice efforts have generally targeted minority communities.""As a consequence, the effects of harsh penal policies in the past 40 years have fallen more heavily on blacks and Hispanics, especially the poorest,"" the report said . ""In 2010, the imprisonment rate for blacks was 4.6 times that for whites.""Moreover, 71.2 million people, nearly 30% of all adults, are included in the master criminal file maintained by the FBI. A spokesman said the file grows by an average of 10,000 to 12,000 first-time arrestees each day.Another impact, said Thena Robinson Mock, a project director at the Advancement Project, a civil rights group examining discipline procedures, is the so-called school-to-prison pipeline.Funding from the 1994 bill helped finance a rise in police officers assigned to schools and ""issues that were school behavior became criminal behavior,"" she said. ""Although it passed in '94, we are still living with the collateral consequences of this.""Write to Gary Fields at gary.fields@wsj.comCredit: By Gary Fields",4/15/16
"Family Splits Over Primary Endorsements; Gwen Carr, Eric Garner's mother, is working with Hillary Clinton while her granddaughter supports Bernie Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781036448?accountid=12768,"Gwen Carr was at a ""Black Lives Matter"" protest last summer in honor of her son, Eric Garner , when a young woman approached her and handed her a business card with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's name on it.""'Madam Secretary said if there's anything you need, please reach out,'"" Ms. Carr recalled the aide from Mrs. Clinton's campaign saying.In the months since, Ms. Carr, whose son was unarmed when he died after being placed in a chokehold by a New York City police officer during an arrest on Staten Island in 2014, has become a frequent fixture on the campaign trail with Mrs. Clinton, appearing at rallies and talking to voters.In a twist that mirrors a generational divide among many Democrats, her granddaughter, Erica Garner, has endorsed Mrs. Clinton's opponent, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Ms. Garner has joined Mr. Sanders at campaign events and appeared in an ad for him.Ms. Garner isn't registered with any party, so she won't be able to vote in Tuesday's primary, according to the city Board of Elections.The intense wooing and dispatching of Ms. Carr and Ms. Garner by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders illustrates the pivotal role of black voters in the Democratic primary, where African-Americans are expected to play a crucial role in a tightening race. It also reflects the anxieties of black voters, who won't see President Barack Obama on the ballot for the first time in nearly a decade.Mr. Garner's death--and a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict the officer involved--sparked protests across New York City and around the country. Now, ahead of Tuesday's primary in New York, the Democratic candidates are hoping Ms. Carr's and Ms. Garner's endorsements will help sway voters.Ben LaBolt, a longtime adviser to Mr. Obama and a Democratic strategist, said the Garner family and others like them could help motivate voters not only in the primary but in the general election as well.""For a Democrat to succeed in the general they've got to turn out many of President Obama supporters as possible,"" Mr. LaBolt said. ""The Garners serve as an emotional clarion call to address the issue and to understand the severe impact that this has had on families across the country.""Mrs. Clinton's campaign pursued Ms. Carr for months, calling her at home in New York numerous times before inviting her to a private meeting in Chicago with the former first lady and other mothers whose children had died in gun violence or high-profile encounters with police.In Chicago, Ms. Carr said Mrs. Clinton sat with the mothers for more than two hours, listening to them tell stories about their children and offer her policy ideas. Also at the table: the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice.""She listened to us, asked us what we think she could do to help. She wrote it down. She didn't have her staff write it down. She did it herself,"" Ms. Carr said.""The other mothers and I, we all looked at each other and sort of said, 'I thought nobody cared.'""Ms. Garner, 25, said she decided to consider Mr. Sanders after Mrs. Clinton was endorsed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio last year. She said she feels betrayed by Mr. de Blasio, who has tempered his criticism of police since thousands of officers turned their backs on him in the weeks after the grand jury declined to indict the officer involved in Mr. Garner's arrest.The officers were angry because the mayor, talking about the Garner case, said he and his wife had to teach their biracial son to be careful when interacting with police.Ms. Garner said the mayor stood with black voters and put his biracial son on display to win election in 2013, but ""turned his back on us"" after drawing criticism from police officers.A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio said the mayor ""respects her views and concerns.""Ms. Garner said she soon reached out to a Sanders campaign aide on Twitter. ""I said, 'What can I do to help?'""We Want to Hear From YouHave something to say about an article in Greater New York? Email us, along with your contact information, at gnyltrs@wsj.com . Letters will be edited for brevity and clarity. Please include your city and state.The response, she said, was almost immediate. Since then, she has stumped for Mr. Sanders in Chicago, South Carolina, North Carolina, Ohio and elsewhere, with her 6 year-old daughter in tow.Ms. Garner and Ms. Carr said they didn't talk about their dueling endorsements with one another, and preferred to keep politics and family separate.Christina Greer, a political-science professor at Fordham University, said endorsements from Ms. Garner and Ms. Carr lend legitimacy to the presidential candidates' campaigns.""This sends a message to black voters: 'We're with you,'"" she said.Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.comCredit: By Mara Gay",4/15/16
The Wall Street I Have Known; Bernie Sanders should ask people like me--refugees from collectivist paradises--about income inequality.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781034076?accountid=12768,"It takes an immigrant like me to parse the poison that Bernie Sanders is peddling to the naive youth of this country. It takes someone who has experienced socialism's failures firsthand--as I did, initially as a small child, later as a young adult--to see why Sen. Sanders is succeeding: We elders, immigrants and native-born alike, have failed to teach our children and grandchildren about the economic history and false promises of the myriad forms of socialism that infest our world.More than 75 years ago, I landed at Ellis Island as a 6-year-old child. My family had fled the despotism of National Socialism that had been foisted onto the gullible (albeit literate) German people. We were far from the only victims of collectivism. As all of us know but some refuse to admit, collectivism destroyed the economies of places like China, Russia and Cuba, and ruined the lives of millions of people.Nine years after I arrived in America, the new state of Israel came into existence, making Jews like me both proud and curious. When I was 18, imbued with idealistic fervor, I decided to help the young nation grow and prosper by working the soil. Off I went to further the goals of social justice by joining a kibbutz, or communal farm. There the painful reality of the maxim Karl Marx popularized, ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,"" hit home.As an example of kibbutz ideology: Does it make sense for a person running the washing machines in the laundry to be receiving exactly the same pay and living benefits as someone who might be the community doctor after going to medical school? That may sound like an extreme example, but the same principles apply throughout the economic structure of a collectivist economy. Unlike Chinese or Russian collectivism, Israel's was voluntary--but insane nonetheless.I left Israel three years later, in 1954, because I was an American citizen and the time had come for me to serve my country. I was drafted and inducted into the U.S. Army. After two years of active duty, stationed back in my native Germany, I realized that my future lay in the capitalist U.S., not in Israel.I came to see that I needed a college degree to get ahead in the competitive society of my home country. Because I had to work during the day to support myself and my family, I attended classes in the evening, taking eight years to get a bachelor's degree in finance and an M.B.A. While going to night school, I got my first Wall Street job.My Wall Street is the real Wall Street--not the imaginary one that Bernie Sanders demonizes daily. My Wall Street is a place filled with opportunities to succeed, even for an immigrant like me without any connections or relatives in the business. Here, I could reach the pinnacle of my profession based on merit.Unlike a certain politically ambitious Brooklynite-turned-Vermonter, I did not have to denigrate others to advance my career. To the contrary, I found wonderful mentors who were happy to reward me for hard work. Much of the job was difficult and far from fun. But I rose--and occasionally fell a bit--based on what I produced, not how many people I could get to toe some party line.My experience is far from unique. I have many colleagues who left supposed paradises, socialist countries like China, Russia and Greece, and now strive to succeed on Wall Street. They're seeking not a handout but a piece of the American Dream, just as I did. When I entered the business Wall Street was a far clubbier place than today. It has increasingly become a meritocracy open to people of every background.Sen. Sanders ought to ask some of the immigrants who work on Wall Street what they think about the opportunities that this country affords, rather than going to college campuses and attacking the financial industry to further his own political ends. He should ask some recent immigrants from India and the emerging world what the true meaning of income inequality is.Bernie Sanders and I are poster children for what poor Jews from Brooklyn or Germany can accomplish in this great land of opportunity. So I ask him: Please stop tearing down the country that has been so good to both of us.Mr. Rosenberg has worked on Wall Street for more than 50 years, most of that time at Loews Corp., where he is now the chief investment strategist.Credit: By Joe Rosenberg",4/15/16

But the new poll shows that most primary voters already have settled on a candidate, with roughly 70% of each candidate's supporters saying they strongly back their pick.Age, more than race, appears to be the defining feature in what looks like a winning coalition for Mrs. Clinton. She outpaces Mr. Sanders by a more than two-to-one margin among likely Democratic primary voters age 45 and older. He has a three-to-one advantage among likely primary voters 29 and younger.Mrs. Clinton also dominates the Vermont senator in and around New York City, a critical advantage, because that is where most of the voters live. The two are essentially tied upstate.The Journal/NBC New York/Marist poll was conducted April 10-13 and included 591 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin of error was plus or minus four percentage points.Write to Patrick O'Connor at patrick.oconnor@wsj.comCredit: By Patrick O'Connor",4/15/16
"Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders Both Backed Crime Law Critics Blame for Unfair System; The Democrats attribute what they call unfairness in the criminal-justice system on a 1994 law they both supported.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780982794?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, embroiled in a contentious New York primary, have been calling for changes to a criminal-justice system they say unfairly targets minorities. But both supported the landmark 1994 law that critics say helped foster the system they now attack.The eruption of the 22-year-old crime law into the 2016 presidential campaign highlights a striking shift in the nation's priorities and political landscape over the past two decades. That is creating particular challenges for Mrs. Clinton, the spouse of a president who approved the law two decades ago.A testy exchange in Philadelphia recently between President Bill Clinton and a protester from the Black Lives Matter movement highlighted the issue. The protester blamed the crime law for the rise in incarceration, primarily of young black men, that critics say has left millions of people struggling to recover economically and socially.Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said anger over the criminal justice system's impact on minority communities is well-placed. ""We've sort of blithely gone along all these years and let our prison population get bigger and bigger, and the impact has been felt most acutely by communities of color, particularly African-American men,"" said Mr. Travis, who directed the Justice Department's research arm in the Clinton years.But Mr. Travis said it is simplistic to blame Mr. Clinton and the 1994 crime bill for the growth in the prison population. ""I am not sure there is a singular villain in this drama,"" he said.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who pushed for even tougher measures at the time, said the environment was completely different in the early 1990s. ""It's easy to forget what was going on,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Look at the current Chicago shooting and murder rate--that was across the whole country."" Chicago has recently seen a jump in homicides.Mr. Gingrich, a Republican, defended Mr. Clinton's initial response to the Philadelphia protester, in which he pointed out that many of the crime wave's victims were black. ""The people being killed in Philadelphia and New York were overwhelmingly minorities,"" Mr. Gingrich said.The term ""super-predator"" also entered the lexicon at the time, describing a group of young people who ostensibly were particularly remorseless. Many have since questioned the concept, and Mrs. Clinton recently expressed regret for using the term.The issue is becoming especially heated as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders appeal for minority votes. But the Clinton crime bill was only one of the era's tough laws spawned by fear of crime. By 1994, the prison population was already growing, in part because of changes to state laws that increased the severity of sentences.Congress had also enacted laws with a similar impact, including the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which abolished parole in the federal system, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which created mandatory minimum drug sentences.From 1980 to 1993, according to Justice Department estimates, the total corrections population--those on probation, parole, in state and federal prisons or in jail--rose from 1.8 million to 4.9 million. The prison population alone nearly tripled, to 969,300 from 329,800.That reflected the national mood. By 1994 the nation was inundated with news footage of yellow crime-scene tape, blanket-covered bodies and grieving families, primarily in inner-city minority neighborhoods, as battles erupted over control of the crack cocaine trade.The FBI estimated that over 72,000 people, nearly half of them African-American, were murdered between 1991 and 1993. Politically, ""soft on crime"" became an epithet to be avoided at all costs.In contrast, the past two decades have seen plummeting crime rates, along with the rise of competing national priorities, especially terrorism and the economy. At the same time, black leaders, and officeholders across the political spectrum, have become alarmed at the high incarceration rate and at relations between police and minorities.As a result, the view is now widespread among Democrats and liberals that the 1994 law was deeply flawed.Ronald Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore School of Law, said the legislation had attracted a clash of competing interests, creating ""this ill-considered parade of ideas often not vetted through the committees of jurisdiction."" Mr. Weich was then counsel to Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), a key player on criminal justice issues who supported the final measure.The finished product had good and bad points, Mr. Weich said, and Mr. Clinton urgently sought its passage as he headed into tough midterm elections. ""President Clinton needed a crime bill,"" Mr. Weich said. ""His health care bill was failing in separate committees of the Congress.""Mr. Clinton wanted 100,000 more police officers on the street. Democrats including Mr. Kennedy sought gun-control provisions. Republicans wanted stiffer penalties. Then-Sen. Joe Biden (D., Del.) and others championed the Violence Against Women Act.Many of these provisions, including an assault-weapons ban, became part of the crime law, as did a measure giving some sentencing relief to minor participants in drug enterprises.But the law also created new criminal offenses and expanded the federal death penalty. More significantly, it provided grants for states that required prisoners serve more time by reducing parole and early release, an approach supporters called ""truth in sentencing.""More than two dozen states and the District of Columbia changed their laws as a result, said Thomas Blomberg, dean of the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University. ""The 1994 crime bill facilitated the continued growth in the use of prison by providing major funding for new prison construction,"" he said.Rep. Bobby Scott (D., Va.) supported certain parts of the law but opposed it overall. While the 1986 mandatory minimum law was the catalyst for today's incarceration rate, he said, the 1994 bill continued the trend.""On balance, it was a lock-em-up bill,"" he said.Twenty-two years later, the effect of the period's tough-on-crime laws can be measured in a variety of ways. The Justice Mapping Center and others have assessed the impact of high incarceration rates on specific neighborhoods and how it increased social costs for families.One of the most recent comprehensive looks at incarceration, ""The Growth of Incarceration in the United States"" by the National Research Council, the operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences, in 2014 confirmed that criminal justice efforts have generally targeted minority communities.""As a consequence, the effects of harsh penal policies in the past 40 years have fallen more heavily on blacks and Hispanics, especially the poorest,"" the report said . ""In 2010, the imprisonment rate for blacks was 4.6 times that for whites.""Moreover, 71.2 million people, nearly 30% of all adults, are included in the master criminal file maintained by the FBI. A spokesman said the file grows by an average of 10,000 to 12,000 first-time arrestees each day.Another impact, said Thena Robinson Mock, a project director at the Advancement Project, a civil rights group examining discipline procedures, is the so-called school-to-prison pipeline.Funding from the 1994 bill helped finance a rise in police officers assigned to schools and ""issues that were school behavior became criminal behavior,"" she said.

Bernie's Wall Street Slander,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763312899?accountid=12768,"Last Friday a crane collapsed in lower Manhattan, killing a man named David Wichs. The next day the papers told the story of his life: a Jewish immigrant from Czechoslovakia; a math whiz with a degree from Harvard; a thoughtful neighbor and husband; ""the nicest, most trustworthy person that I have known,"" according to his boss, Mark Gorton, of Tower Research Capital. Mr. Wichs was just 38 when he died.I never met Mr. Wichs, but reading about him reminded me of so many people I know in his industry -- prodigiously bright and slyly funny, reasonably wealthy but rarely ostentatious, family men of the type who show up at school auctions and United Jewish Appeal dinners. Maybe they voted for Barack Obama the first time, probably not the second. They're the people who, even now, make American finance the envy of the world.They're the most demonized people in America.That's the import of Bernie Sanders's remark, in his debate last week with Hillary Clinton, that ""the business model of Wall Street is fraud."" The senator from Vermont went on to say that ""corruption is rampant"" in the financial sector, his evidence being that ""major bank after major bank has reached multibillion settlements"" with the feds.This wasn't the first time Mr. Sanders has accused Wall Street of fraud, and it surely won't be the last. No political or social penalties attach, in today's America, to the wholesale indictment of this entire industry and the people who work in it. Had another presidential candidate made a similarly damning remark about some other profession -- public-school teachers, say, or oil-rig workers -- there would have been the usual outcry about false stereotypes, the decline of civility and so on. When Bernie says it about Wall Street there's a collective shrug, if not nodding agreement.Some six million people work in financial services in America, according to Commerce Department figures. Take only the securities and investment end of the business, and you're still talking about 900,000 people, a population that considerably exceeds Vermont's 626,000. Is Mr. Sanders suggesting that some large proportion of those 900,000 is in on the fraud; that every man among them is a Madoff -- including David Wichs? And if they are the criminals he alleges, does he mean to put a few thousand of them behind bars?Those are questions that ought to be put to Mr. Sanders, and ones his supporters might also want to ask themselves. The strength of the Sanders candidacy is said to lie in the purity of his idealism, especially in contrast to the morally flexible and ideologically ambidextrous candidacy of Mrs. Clinton.But the reason Mr. Sanders is drawing his big crowds is neither his fanatical sincerity nor his avuncular charm. It's that he's preaching class hatred to people besotted by the politics of envy. Barack Obama, running for president eight years ago, famously suggested to Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher that ""when you spread the wealth around it's good for everybody.""Mr. Sanders dispenses with the niceties. ""I do not have millionaire or billionaire friends,"" he boasts, as if there's an income ceiling on virtue. That's telling the 10,100,000 American households with a net worth of at least $1 million (excluding the value of their homes) to buzz off.It is also telling any intellectually sentient voter that the drift of the modern Democratic Party runs in the same illiberal direction as the Trumpian right, only with a different set of targets. Mr. Sanders thinks Wall Street's guilt is proved by its capitulation to the demands of a government that could barely prove a single case of banker fraud in court.Another interpretation is that a government with almost unlimited powers to break, sue, micromanage or otherwise ruin an unpopular institution is not a government banks are eager to fight. The problem with capitalism isn't that it concentrates excessive economic power in the hands of the few. It's that it gives political power ever-tastier treats on which to feast. Covering for that weakness is the reason Wall Street plows money into the pockets of pliable Democrats like Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker -- and Mrs. Clinton.That's something Mr. Sanders will never understand, being the sort of man whose notion of wisdom is to hold fast to the angry convictions of his adolescence. That may be why he connects with so many younger voters. But it's also why his moral judgments are so sweeping and juvenile. Wall Street remains one of America's crowning glories. To insinuate that the people who make it work are swindlers is no less a slur than to tag immigrants as criminals and moochers.My colleague Holman Jenkins once cracked that some plausible ideas vanish in the presence of thought. I would add that some widespread beliefs vanish in the presence of decency. That goes as much for Bernie Sanders's economic prejudices as it does for Donald Trump's ethnic ones, a thought that ought to trouble the placid consciences of this column's more liberal readers.---Write bstephens@wsj.com.Credit: By Bret Stephens",4/15/16
Presidential Candidates Court New York Jews; Republicans Ted Cruz and John Kasich visit Orthodox Brooklyn neighborhoods; Bernie Sanders faces criticism over remarks on Israel,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781242634?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--It was a sight that even those anticipating a competitive New York presidential primary on Tuesday hadn't expected to witness: Republican candidate Ted Cruz in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn belting out ""Dayenu,"" the traditional Passover Seder song.With New York's many delegates in play this year, candidates from both parties have sought to court Jewish voters, a population known for its high turnout. New York contains the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside Israel.""It's part and parcel of New York being in play--when was the last time you saw a presidential primary candidate in Brooklyn baking matzos?"" said Ester Fuchs, a professor of political science at Columbia University who worked as a special adviser to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""I can't remember in a primary, in my voting lifetime, seeing this.""In the past week, both Mr. Cruz and GOP rival Ohio Gov. John Kasich have made pilgrimages to Brooklyn matzo bakeries. The Texas senator graces the cover of the current issue of Ami Magazine, a publication that caters to the Orthodox Jewish community.The Cruz campaign's outreach to New York Jews ""has been very systematic and very well-concentrated and very targeted over the last year,"" including reaching out to former Sen. Marco Rubio voters, said Michael Fragin, a New York-based Republican political operative whose work focuses on the Jewish community. He is unaffiliated with any campaign.Of the magazine cover, Mr. Fragin said: ""He will be on [the] Shabbos reading list of many Orthodox Jewish families this weekend.""On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's campaign has had a helping hand from Avi Fink, an Orthodox Jewish senior political aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has taken a leave of absence from City Hall to assist the front-runner.On Tuesday, a group of 12 Jewish New York City Council members announced their support for Mrs. Clinton, saying ""she helped build an international coalition to put in place the toughest sanctions in Iran's history, and at every turn, she has been a steadfast supporter of Israel's right to defend itself against Jihadist threats.""Her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has encountered a backlash over his recent comments to the New York Daily News editorial board in which he overstated the number of Palestinians killed in the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, as well as for his absence at this year's American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference.His campaign suffered another setback this week after it suspended his national Jewish outreach coordinator, Simone Zimmerman, over social media posts containing derogatory references to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mrs. Clinton.And during a Brooklyn debate on Thursday, Mr. Sanders broke from the language that most major Democratic and Republican candidates use on the campaign trail when he questioned the actions of the Israeli government and expressed his sympathy for Palestinians. ""I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people,"" he said. ""That does not make me anti-Israel.""Among likely Jewish Democratic primary voters in New York, Mrs. Clinton holds a wide lead over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist College poll released Thursday. Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Sanders by 65% to 32%, the poll found. Jewish voters, who are predominantly Democrats, constituted about 16% of the likely Democratic primary voter sample.In the 2008 Democratic presidential primary in New York, Jews constituted about 16% of voters, according to Ms. Fuchs.Mr. Sanders has also raised eyebrows for what some in the community perceive as his failure to publicly embrace his Jewish identity. Some of his supporters, however, say such criticism is hypocritical.""I think it's unfair, in some ways, that this is the way he's being cast,"" said Daniel Sieradski, founder of the PAC Jews for Bernie. ""The vast majority of American Jews are secular.""David Greenfield, an Orthodox New York City councilman who is one of those backing Mrs. Clinton, said he believes Mr. Sanders's religion has worked against him in the Jewish community. ""I think identity politics only matter if the person shares your values and beliefs as well, and I think in this case he doesn't share them, especially in the case of supporting Israel,"" Mr. Greenfield said. ""It's even more offensive that he's Jewish and hasn't been supportive of Israel.""Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Recap: Thursday's Democratic Debate in Brooklyn* Hillary Clinton Leads Bernie Sanders in New York by 17 Points Ahead of Primary, Poll Finds* Racial Issues Take Center Stage for Sanders, Clinton in New York* Prosecutors Won't Charge Trump Campaign Manager With Battery* John Kasich Sees a Path Through the Northeast""Given that more than 70% of American Jewish voters support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, he's confident that message isn't just our best hope for lasting peace and responsible foreign policy, but also one that will resonate with a broad swath of voters in New York and across the country,"" said Karthik Ganapathy, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders.Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Thursday met privately with representatives of Jewish media outlets for interviews in his Trump Tower office in Midtown.Unlike his GOP opponents, he hasn't been campaigning in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods, though many political operatives believe his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who helped write Mr. Trump's AIPAC speech, has been doing outreach in such communities.On the GOP side, Mr. Fragin expressed surprise that most candidates had flocked to the areas of Borough Park, Midwood or Brighton Beach, which contain large numbers of Jewish registered Democrats, instead of traveling to the south shore of Long Island, Rockland County or the village of Kiryas Joel, where there are thousands of registered Orthodox Republicans.Leah Winner, the youth program director at Chabad Neshama Center, where Mr. Cruz made his appearance, said it had been ""very important"" for a presidential candidate like Mr. Cruz to have visited.Asked if Mr. Cruz was familiar with Jewish traditions, she said: ""I'm not going to lie.

Each said that they would force financial institutions deemed to be too big to fail to be broken apart--each in their own way.Mrs. Clinton reiterated that she would follow the road map in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, while Mr. Sanders pressed for new legislation that would leave it up to the banks to figure out how they would shrink their operations.""We have the law,"" said Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner and former secretary of state, referring to the Dodd-Frank Act, which gives regulators the power to shrink the largest banks. ""We've got to execute under it. I will move immediately to break up any financial institution.""Mr. Sanders fired back that fraudulent practices by Wall Street banks were enough reason to break them up.""I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks,"" Mr. Sanders said, pointing to a recent $5 billion settlement between Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the government over subprime mortgage loans.""If elected president, I will break them up,"" the Vermont senator said. ""We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion,"" said Mr. Sanders, referring to a bill he introduced in May 2015.Under Dodd-Frank, banks with $50 billion or more in assets are required to draw up credible bankruptcy plans, or ""living wills."" Failing to write a reliable plan opens the way for regulators to cap the size of the firm or limit its activities.The banks could also be required to slim down if the Financial Stability Oversight Council, headed by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, identifies a firm as systemically important. If the council's 10 voting members--mostly heads of regulatory agencies--decide that is the case, a firm is placed under the Fed's supervision, and its size or activities could be limited.During an often testy exchange, Mr. Sanders once again found himself defending his plan to allow banks that are deemed too big to fail to break themselves up . Pressed further, Mr. Sanders drew loud applause when he said he didn't think it was ""appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions. What we need is to make sure that they are safe.""The debate over how and when to force banks to shrink activities comes ahead of Tuesday's New York primary, and only a day after five large U.S. banks were told by regulators their living wills didn't meet the standard laid out in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. found that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., and State Street Corp. submitted flawed plans to go through bankruptcy at no cost to taxpayers.Mr. Sanders again brought up political contributions and payments for speeches that Mrs. Clinton has received from Wall Street. Asked to point to an example of how Wall Street contributions influenced Mrs. Clinton's policies, he referred to the decision not to break up the big institutions after the financial crisis pushed the nation into the deepest recession since the Great Depression. At the time, however, Mrs. Clinton was no longer in Congress.""Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example,"" Mrs. Clinton said, addressing Dana Bash, a debate moderator. ""I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator. I called them out on their mortgage behavior.""Her response elicited a sarcastic jab by Mr. Sanders. ""Secretary Clinton called them out,"" he said. ""Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.""Write to Donna Borak at donna.borak@wsj.comCredit: By Donna Borak",4/16/16
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Make Their Closing Arguments to New Yorkers; Front-runner reaches out to minorities and women; Vermont senator attracts massive crowds ahead of Tuesday primary,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781648453?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton closed out the race for New York with an aggressive outreach to women and nonwhite voters, as she labored to put rival Bernie Sanders in the rearview mirror.Polls showed the former New York senator with a solid lead in her adopted state ahead of Tuesday's primary, though her aides cautioned the race may be tighter than those surveys would suggest. Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, is drawing the most energetic signs of support, with 28,000 flocking to a rally in Brooklyn on Sunday, after a similar number showed up in Manhattan last week.""I never count any chickens before they hatch,"" Mrs. Clinton said from the trail.With just a few large states left to vote, Mr. Sanders needs a victory here Tuesday if he is to have any chance of catching up to Mrs. Clinton's substantial delegate lead.Both candidates focused their final days around New York's five boroughs, where most of Tuesday's Democratic votes are expected to be cast. In Queens, Mrs. Clinton visited a group of mostly Hispanic carwash workers who recently formed a union, and she tried her first bubble tea as she greeted Asian voters at a food court in Flushing.Her strongest support has come from African-American voters. At weekend events, both Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were accompanied by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who repeatedly vouched for her.Clinton aides said the issue of gun violence was particularly important in motivating black voters to the polls, and the former secretary of state hit on the topic repeatedly.At a rally aimed at women on Monday in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton cited Mr. Sanders's support for a bill that gave gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. She and then-Sen. Barack Obama voted against it, she said. ""Bernie Sanders voted for it!""""Sen. Sanders talks a lot about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street,"" she said. ""But what about the greed and recklessness of the gun manufacturers?""Mr. Sanders said in a CNN interview on Monday that lawsuits, including one filed by parents of children killed in Newtown, Conn., should be allowed to proceed, but he isn't sure if they have merit. ""If I sell you a legal product, am I liable for the crazy thing that you do with it? I think not,"" he said.More on Election 2016* Republican Voters Want Say in Choosing Nominee, Poll Finds* Trump Continues to Attack GOP Over Delegate System (April 16)* Pope Has Brief, Impromptu Meeting With Sanders (April 16)* Donald Trump Holds 29-Point Lead Before New York Primary, Poll Shows (April 15)* Ted Cruz Poised to Notch More Delegates in Wyoming (April 15)* Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders Hit Hard in New York Debate (April 15)It isn't a topic he typically addresses on the stump. At a huge rally Sunday, he made only oblique reference to the matter. ""Our job is to give kids jobs, not guns,"" he said.Mr. Sanders has worked to cut into Mrs. Clinton's support among nonwhite voters, and his aides say he has made progress with younger African-Americans. In New York, he held events devoted to racial issues and showcased endorsements from prominent black leaders, including entertainer Harry Belafonte. On Monday, he held a roundtable discussion on Puerto Rican issues, including his view that creditors must be forced to accept lower payments to resolve the island's debt crisis.But on the eve of the New York vote, Mr. Sanders seemed to be relying more on a shock-and-awe strategy, staging huge outdoor rallies that demonstrated the grass-roots enthusiasm that his campaign has generated.On Monday, Mr. Sanders also led a somewhat chaotic procession through the streets of Queens, where he ambled along greeting everyone from teenage twin boys to a woman who emerged from a beauty salon, dye still in her hair.The Clinton events were generally smaller and tamer, but the campaign covered twice the ground as it deployed the former president, who put particular focus on turning out minority voters.Mr. Clinton spoke at three African-American churches on Sunday in Queens and on Long Island. Sitting in the pews at Antioch Baptist Church in Queens were six black women who lost family and loved ones to gun violence. He then led a trio of outdoor rallies in some of New York City's most diverse neighborhoods.He touched several issues of particular importance to the black community. He said police forces should more closely mirror the racial and ethnic makeup of the neighborhoods they patrol. He highlighted rising incomes for African-Americans when he was president. And Mr. Clinton called for tougher gun laws and shorter prison sentences for nonviolent offenders.At a housing complex in Queens, he was introduced by Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a leader of the civil-rights movement who was beaten during a 1965 march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala.Mr. Lewis dramatically cast the election in terms of racial progress. ""I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Alabama, for the right to vote,"" Mr. Lewis said.Erica Orden contributed to this article.Credit: By Laura Meckler and Peter Nicholas",4/18/16
"The Damage Bernie's Hillary Bashing May Do; Damage from attacks is starting to matter, especially in Clinton's standing with independent voters",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781567176?accountid=12768,"As the big New York primary election arrives, it would be a mistake to say the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination is dragging on with no end in sight. Despite tightening poll numbers, it's dragging on with a likely end still in sight: Hillary Clinton prevailing, both in New York and nationwide, because the delegate math works inexorably in her favor.So the question increasingly is this: How much damage is she absorbing at the hands of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the meantime?The answer: The damage is hardly fatal but it is starting to matter, especially in Mrs. Clinton's standing with crucial independent voters. The specific problem isn't merely that Mr. Sanders's tone has turned more harsh in attacking her. The particular problem is that his critique increasingly focuses on declaring she can't be trusted because she takes campaign contributions from big banks and big business. That is a line of attack that seems almost designed to hit Mrs. Clinton in her area of greatest vulnerability, which is voter doubts about her honesty and trustworthiness.Of course, this is the stage of a tough election race when it's common for partisans in either party--or this year, in both parties--to lament that a bruising primary season is hurting their chances for victory in the general election. And frequently those concerns turn out to be overblown. Certainly Democrats lamented the length and tone of the long Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton fight in 2008, and that fight turned out to be, if anything, helpful in tuning up Mr. Obama for a big November win.More* Poll: Clinton Lead Over Sanders Narrows* Front-Runners Increasingly Unpopular* The Place That Most Wants Trump* Trump Card: GOP Voters Don't Want a 'White Knight'""I think Sanders is hurting Clinton with Republicans--but they wouldn't have voted for her anyway,"" says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ""With Democrats and independents the effect is minimal. So real impact is marginal at best.""Still, there is impact, as suggested by some readings inside a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. In that survey, the share of voters who hold a negative view of Mrs. Clinton continues to grow.Perhaps of most concern to Democrats are the signs of souring views among independent voters. In January, the share of independent voters who had positive views of Mrs. Clinton stood at 35%, while 54% had negative views. In the new survey, just 20% of independent voters had positive views, while 62% had negative views.There even is evidence of damage among soft Democrats--that is, people who lean Democratic but aren't core partisans. Among that group, the share holding negative views of Mrs. Clinton grew to 32% this month from 21% in January.Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster, thinks the ""aggressive"" Sanders tone is likely to backfire with Democratic women, who make up 59% of the party's primary voters. But she also worries it is eroding one of the party's key advantages this year.""Originally I think Sanders played an important role mobilizing voters and articulating an important economic and change message,"" she says. ""I think voters found refreshing the contrast with the Republicans of two candidates engaged in serious conversation about our country's future and offering a real platform. Now with ridiculous, overstated attacks like Hillary isn't qualified it makes us look as bad as the Republicans and turns off voters.""The tone problem for the party was on full display at a big Sanders rally in New York City last week, where one speaker, health-care activist Dr. Paul Song, said liberals' goal of achieving Medicare for all won't happen ""if we continue to elect corporate Democratic whores who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry.""Dr. Song later apologized and said he was referring to Democrats in Congress, not to Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Sanders said the remarks were ""inappropriate.""Still, the tone is the sort of thing that could give moderate Republicans who might otherwise never vote for businessman Donald Trump a reason to think about doing exactly that.It's also rhetoric consistent with Mr. Sanders's broader critique--she's a captive of special interests who will abandon average folks, on their behalf--which threatens to exacerbate Mrs. Clinton's biggest problem, which is that many voters suspect she isn't to be trusted. In the new Journal/NBC News poll, just 19% gave her good marks for being ""honest and straightforward.""Mrs. Clinton appears to have the upper hand in a general-election matchup against either Mr. Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But in either case, she'll need Sanders voters to show up for her in the fall. And it appears that in a matchup against Mr. Trump, a fair share of her vote would come from people embracing her as the lesser of two evils.The problem with the Sanders attacks is he is close to portraying her as at least representing a kind of evil in the system, which threatens to erode that particular advantage.Write to Gerald F.

"Pope Has Brief, Impromptu Meeting With Sanders; Pontiff plays down the encounter, saying he merely shook the candidate's hand as a courtesy",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781347825?accountid=12768,"ROME--Pope Francis met with Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday during the presidential candidate's visit to Rome, but the pontiff played down the brief encounter, saying he had merely shaken Mr. Sanders's hand out of politeness after finding him in the foyer of his residence early that morning.""This morning when I came out there was Senator Sanders,"" the pope said. ""He knew I was going to come out at that hour and he was kind enough to greet me."" The pope was speaking to reporters Saturday afternoon on his flight back from the Greek island of Lesbos, where he had gone to draw attention to Europe's migrant crisis.Earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders's representative had discussed the short encounter with the pope at Domus Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse, where the pontiff lives.Mr. Sanders and his wife had been staying overnight there after a conference at a Vatican academy at which Mr. Sanders had been a guest speaker. The candidate's unusual break from the campaign trail, before the crucial New York Democratic primary, had surprised observers and many of his allies in the U.S.The visit had also created awkwardness for the pope, who usually avoids even the appearance of involvement in the electoral politics of other countries. After Pope Francis canceled plans to greet conference participants Friday evening, it appeared that the two leaders wouldn't cross paths, since both would be leaving Rome early Saturday.""Bernie was honored to spend some time with the pope, whom he considers to be one of the extraordinary figures in modern world history,"" Mr. Sanders's spokesman Michael Briggs said of the Saturday meeting.Pope Francis' account, in response to a reporter who asked about possible political implications, made clear the encounter was an impromptu one.""When I came down, he greeted me, we shook hands and nothing more. It's common courtesy, it's called common courtesy, not getting mixed up in politics. If someone thinks that greeting somebody means getting mixed up in politics, he should go see a psychiatrist,"" the pope said.Mr. Sanders was to return to the campaign trail in New York on Saturday.Credit: By Francis X.

Bernie Sanders Addresses Academic Conference at the Vatican; Democratic presidential hopeful says he is unfazed by political risks of taking break from the campaign trail,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781239129?accountid=12768,"VATICAN CITY--Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders took an unusual break from the campaign trail Friday to lecture about Catholic teaching on economic justice--more than 4,000 miles away from a New York primary that he needs to win.Coming off an overnight flight following a contentious debate with rival Hillary Clinton, Mr. Sanders addressed an academic conference at the Vatican.His voice hoarse yet forceful, the Vermont senator touched on topics familiar from his campaign, including the problem of income inequality and the need for campaign finance reform.He also quoted some of Pope Francis' severe criticisms of capitalism, including his denunciations of a ""cult of money"" and a ""globalization of indifference"" to the needy.Mr. Sanders's decision to leave the campaign trail days before Tuesday's primary was a bit of a gamble . Though the trip received widespread press coverage, he relinquished a full day of campaigning in a state where he trails Mrs. Clinton by double digits, polls show. New York is one of the best chances left for Mr. Sanders to cut into his opponent's lead of 250 pledged delegates for the Democratic nomination.Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist not aligned with either candidate, said in an interview before Mr. Sanders departed: ""He's going to perhaps lose a little bit of momentum in New York and come back very tired going into the home stretch. I don't see the political benefit they [the Sanders campaign] apparently see.""Mr. Sanders suggested the invitation was simply an opportunity he couldn't resist . He long has said he admires Pope Francis' critiques of unfettered markets and obsession with money.During a discussion with other conference participants, the Vermont senator said he didn't ""choose to politicize the pope"" but was a ""fan of the pope's clarity, his humility, his vision and his courage"" in addressing urgent problems ranging from youth unemployment to climate change.Meeting separately with reporters, Mr. Sanders said he was unfazed by any political risks.""I know it's taking me away from the campaign trail for a day, but ... it was so moving to me that it was something that I could just simply not refuse to attend,"" he said.In his short stay at the Vatican, it appeared he wouldn't cross paths with Pope Francis. Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, chancellor of the Vatican body sponsoring the event, read a message from the pope that said he had planned to visit the conference site and greet the participants.But, Pope Francis added in his note, he ultimately couldn't make it because of preparations for his Saturday visit to the Greek island of Lesbos , where he is scheduled to meet asylum seekers and address the European migration crisis .That announcement seemed to resolve the major question hanging over Mr. Sanders's trip: whether his visit to Rome, scheduled to last less than 24 hours, would yield at least a brief moment with the pope.It would have been highly unusual for the pope to meet a presidential candidate such as Mr. Sanders, even for a photographed handshake, since the Vatican ordinarily avoids even the appearance of involvement in the electoral politics of foreign countries.Pope Francis' remark in February that Donald Trump's stands on immigration mean that the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination was ""not Christian"" was a notable departure from that policy.Yet the pope's low regard for protocol had raised expectations that Mr. Sanders might a get a moment with the pontiff after all.Even the pope's written admission that he would have met with a group including the senator was a significant concession. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, had said on Thursday that there were no plans for Pope Francis to meet conference participants.Mr. Sanders's speech was part of an academic conference dedicated to the 25th anniversary of an encyclical by St. John Paul II, ""Centesimus Annus,"" which is best known for its qualified praise of free market economics--a breakthrough in papal teaching.Yet the conference was notable for the participation of two prominent critics of globalization, the populist presidents of Ecuador and Bolivia, Rafael Correa and Evo Morales. Mr. Correa, who spoke shortly before Mr. Sanders Friday afternoon, spoke of the need to restrain the ""excesses of savage capitalism.""Mr. Sanders's indictments of economic inequities were welcomed by other participants. During the discussion session, the senator reiterated his calls for improving inner-city schools and making public colleges tuition free, and he stressed the need to protect individual privacy from surveillance by governments and corporations even while fighting terrorism.""I think in my country there is a lot of fear about the future,"" he said. ""Politicians play on that fear.""Write to Francis X. Rocca at francis.rocca@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Francis X. Rocca and Peter Nicholas",4/18/16
Bernie's Spinal Surgery on CEOs; A few firms are finally standing up to defend themselves from the left's nonstop attacks.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781034269?accountid=12768,"Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam is receiving hosannas for his takedown Wednesday of Bernie Sanders, in which he rapped the presidential candidate's views on corporate America as ""uninformed,"" ""contemptible,"" and ""wrong""--among other things. He'd be worthy of even more praise had he also applied those words to the ""Not I"" business community that helped create this moment.Mr. McAdam is right that Mr. Sanders is wrong. American businesses aren't immoral. They create jobs, prosperity, investment and tax revenue. They are the essence and the requirement of a democracy. Far from an immoral system, U.S. capitalism is the wonder and envy of the world. The greater wonder is that it remains so, despite the pusillanimous behavior of its most prominent representatives.It has been many a year since corporate America could claim to have an intact spinal system, though its retreat into nervelessness has accelerated over the past decade. We've reached a moment at which Mr. Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren can daily tar companies as the villains of the world, and receive applause from voters both left and right. Blame it on the great recession; blame it on a litigious environment; blame it on President Obama. But mostly blame it on the companies themselves. When asked time and again who among them would stand up for the American way, they mumbled ""Not I.""This is the corporate America (Alcoa, Duke Energy, Pacific Gas and Electric, General Electric) that rushed to curry favor with the green left, forming the Climate Action Partnership in 2007 in hopes of rigging any coming carbon caps in its favor. It's the corporate America (Exelon, Nike, Apple) that folded like an accordion when the Chamber of Commerce questioned President Obama's plan to impose a climate program by EPA fiat. It's the corporate America (Google, Facebook, eBay) that ditched the free-market American Legislative Exchange Council when that group came under fire from environmental activists. Who will stand up for low-cost energy, or consumers, or principle? ""Not I.""It's the corporate America (Pfizer, the American Medical Association, America's Health Insurance Plans) that sold out health care to the Obama administration, each company and trade organization hoping to cut its own special deal. It's the Solyndras and Fisker Automotives and A123 Systems that sucked up stimulus money and left taxpayers with the bill. It's the Boeings and Caterpillars that insist on subsidies from the Export-Import Bank. It's the car companies that folded to higher mileage standards, the Internet companies that folded to net neutrality, the agribusinesses that finagled expensive ethanol mandates, and the big retailers that push for Internet taxation to hobble smaller competitors. Who will stand up for free markets? ""Not I.""True, trade groups are often to be found in the trenches of Congress, fighting the worst regulations or bills, maybe even running a TV ad or two. Then again, trade groups are also convenient places for CEOs to hide their policy efforts, a way of outsourcing the dirty job to an acronym.Who was the last prominent CEO to go on an extended public riff about the evils of Dodd-Frank, or the ridiculousness of the ""equal pay"" debate, or the nonsense that is Obama energy policy? ""Not I, not I, not I.""These are the companies that play the 55-45 game, dividing their political giving nearly equally between the party that supports their free-market interests and the party that routinely refers them to the Justice Department. Some firms--particularly in finance--believe it is better to try to buy off the enemy with contributions (beat us only gently, please) than to draw criticism for supporting a free-market candidate.So today, on the stump, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton routinely call for the jailing of executives. Bernie pitches single-payer health care as a fix to ObamaCare. Hillary calls for expanding paid vacation and maternity leave. Both candidates want to double regulations on Wall Street, hike taxes, raise the minimum wage, increase union payoffs, and make energy unaffordable. They brand companies that do business overseas as traitors and sellouts.Mr. McAdam is now speaking out. He follows General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who recently refuted Mr. Sanders's assertion that companies are ""destroying the moral fabric of this country."" Exxon Mobil this week filed in state court a forceful rejoinder to the state attorneys general who are pursuing the bogus claim that the oil company suppressed climate science. This is all positive movement, though it comes only at extreme moments. The usual business behavior is to sit quiet, while expecting the free-market activists and congressmen (their Little Red Hens) to step up and defend them in proxy fights, or Congress, or the public sphere.Businesses have long justified this by noting that capitalism is rooted in self-interest, and that corporations are simply pursuing that interest when they dodge fights or engage in crony capitalism. But there's short-term self-interest and long-term self-interest. The long-term is now here, in the form of Bernie Sanders.Write to kim@wsj.com.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",4/18/16
"Trump, Sanders Roll in N.H. --- Cluster of GOP Rivals Leaves Field Muddled",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764093390?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Donald Trump won the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary by a decisive margin Tuesday, claiming his first victory of the 2016 campaign and leaving the rest of the GOP field as murky as ever.The billionaire businessman received 35% of the vote -- more than double his nearest competitor -- allowing him to regain momentum in a race that he has led since the summer on the strength of his blustery, tradition-defying style.Lagging far behind was a cluster of rivals, none of whom broke from the pack enough to establish himself as a singular alternative to Mr. Trump.The biggest beneficiary was Ohio Gov. John Kasich, buoyed by a surge of late-deciding voters from far back in the pack. His second-place finish rescues him from near-certain elimination if he had failed to catch fire in a state he had made almost the sole focus of his campaign.New Hampshire had been expected to be a springboard for Sen. Marco Rubio, but his widely panned debate performance Saturday, where he was attacked repeatedly by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, proved damaging. Exit polls found two-thirds of voters said recent debates had been important to their decision on how to vote.For Mr. Christie, his withering takedown wasn't enough to elevate his own flagging campaign, casting doubt on his ability to continue in the race. He canceled his appearances in South Carolina, the site of the next GOP primary, opting to head home to New Jersey to consider his next steps in the presidential race. ""We're going to take a deep breath and see what the results are tonight,"" he said.Lou DeRosa, an energy consultant from Hampstead, said the debate left Mr. Rubio bruised by charges that he was too inexperienced and ill equipped for the presidency. ""I think that Rubio got destroyed by a little love tap in the debate,"" said Mr. De Rosa, who voted for Mr. Kasich.As returns came in, Mr. Rubio was trailing Mr. Kasich, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- winner of the Iowa caucuses -- and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a former mentor whose own faltering campaign may get some breathing room from the New Hampshire results.Mr. Rubio had been counting on his surprisingly strong third-place finish in Iowa to give him a head of steam -- ""Marcomentum,"" as his campaign has dubbed it in recent days. Polls had shown him steadily in second place in New Hampshire before the weekend debate.The results bring little clarity to the competition among GOP candidates who are seeking to be the mainstream GOP alternative to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. That portends a lengthy and difficult race because the longer there are at least three viable candidates amassing delegates, the harder it becomes for anyone to clinch the nomination.Mr. Trump's victory declaration by the Associated Press and television networks came so soon after the polls closed that many of his supporters had yet to arrive at his victory party.He hailed his win with characteristic bombast: ""We are going to do something so good, so fast and so strong, and the world is going to respect us again -- believe me.""Mr. Kasich promised his supporters a tough fight ahead. ""If you don't have a seat belt, go get one.""Mr. Trump's big lead belies skepticism about whether he could translate his huge rally crowds and high poll numbers into victory in a state where voters have high expectations of contact with presidential candidates.The near-deadlock among the next tier of candidates means that a robust competition among Messrs. Rubio, Kasich and other candidates will continue into the next primary contests on terrain less hospitable to those more-establishment oriented candidates.The nominating contest now moves to deeply conservative Southern states more hospitable to the candidacies of Messrs. Trump and Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses last week largely on the strength of evangelical Christian support.Next up are South Carolina and Nevada, where evangelicals and a stauncher brand of conservatism dominate. Beyond those states, the path to the nomination doesn't get much smoother for the party's establishment-oriented candidates. On March 1, 11 states vote in the so-called SEC primary, which includes Alabama, Georgia and Arkansas.Mr. Kasich, the candidate who diverges most often from conservative orthodoxy, is undaunted by the prospect. He has three events scheduled in South Carolina Wednesday, chartered a plane to carry the press along, and promised a full-court press even though he has only slim political organization beyond New Hampshire.""We take our snow boots off and put our flip-flops on,"" Mr. Kasich told reporters outside a polling site in Concord. ""We're going to go to South Carolina. We'll go tonight.""To be sure, New Hampshire could drive one or more candidates from the race but no one was ready to concede anything over the past week of intensive campaigning in the snow-blanketed Granite State.All nine candidates were scrambling to woo the many voters -- Republicans and independents -- who were undecided until the last minute. According to exit polls, 46% of GOP voters made up their mind on Tuesday or in last ""few days.""""In New Hampshire you can throw those polls away,"" said John Lyons, an 83-year-old Portsmouth independent who even put off the decision about which party's primary to vote in. ""People will go into that booth, and they won't mean a thing. People are different here in New Hampshire.""The GOP electorate is indeed distinctive. In New Hampshire, exit polls showed that 25% of voters said they are evangelicals or born-again Christians; they were 64% in Iowa and are projected to be 65% in South Carolina. New Hampshire's voters also are less conservative: 29% of primary voters said they were ""very conservative"" -- compared with 40% in Iowa and 36% in South Carolina.Exit polls showed Mr. Trump winning among almost every major demographic group. Only among evangelical voters did he not dominate, essentially tying Mr. Cruz for their votes. Among GOP primary voters who described themselves as ""moderate,"" Mr. Trump only narrowly beat Mr. Kasich, exit polls showed.Those voter surveys showed New Hampshire voters were more concerned about the economy and terrorism than they were about immigration, but among those who were worried about immigration, Mr. Trump garnered the biggest share of the vote.New Hampshire polls were unanimous in predicting a Trump victory, but the battle among the rest of the field came to resemble ""The Hunger Games,"" a fight for political life among several candidates.That battle for second and third place intensified in large part because Mr. Rubio seemed to lose momentum after a fumbling debate performance Saturday that fueled his rivals' claims that he is too inexperienced and ill-equipped for the presidency.The exit polls indicated a substantial number of late deciding voters went to Mr. Kasich. He benefited from voters like Sonya Bouchard, a Concord resident, who said she found his more upbeat campaign style appealing at a time when most candidates were attacking each other. ""I like that he's positive,"" she said, adding that she didn't decide on him until Tuesday morning. ""I don't like all the fighting.""New Hampshire exit polls suggest that Republicans may remain divided long after they pick a nominee. More than half of GOP primary voters said they would be disappointed if either Messrs. Cruz or Rubio claim the nomination. They split almost evenly on whether they would be satisfied or dissatisfied by Mr. Trump becoming the nominee.---Paul Overberg, Heather Haddon, Colleen McCain Nelson and Reid J.

Explaining Bernie's 'Socialism',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763982890?accountid=12768,"In the 1940s, many Western societies began adopting single-payer health systems as a way to expand access to the relatively few things medical care at the time could do for patients.This was an agenda that, for obvious reason, could appeal to both consumers and providers of health care.We live in a different time. If the U.S. were to embark on a single-payer system today, as Bernie Sanders proposes, it would not be doing so to expand access -- though that slogan would still be used -- but for a very different reason: to deny and limit care in order to control spending.This agenda would be popular with neither patients nor providers, and therefore would be dead in the water -- as liberal authorities, from the New York Times's Paul Krugman to Henry J. Aaron of the Brookings Institution, have suddenly discovered an urgency to point out to Democratic voters infatuated with Bernie Sanders.Mr. Sanders knows it too. His socialism is farcical in a country that can't afford the entitlements it already has.The one zinger that has found its mark during the current campaign has been Chelsea Clinton's claim that his plan endangers Medicare, which Mr. Sanders now brings up constantly in order to refute it. Mr. Sanders knows that seniors aren't stupid. They vote, and if they took his plan seriously, they would turn out in droves to protect Medicare from being raided by other age groups.Take another farcical element of Mr. Sanders's farcical socialism. He tweaks Hillary over $675,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. Unmentioned by the scourge of big money is Bill Clinton's far more egregious buckracking.By the estimate of IBT Media, Mr. Clinton collected between $54 million and $141 million from governments and arms manufacturers who had arms-deal approvals pending before his wife's State Department. His own disclosures indicate at least $20 million in speaking fees from banks and businesses since his wife began publicly eyeing the presidency.A Washington Post investigation finds a ""substantial overlap between the Clinton political machinery and the [charitable] foundation"" and that ""many of the foundation's biggest donors are foreigners who are legally barred from giving to U.S. political candidates.""Yet all this goes unremarked by Mr. Sanders, that ferocious denouncer of monied corruption. Why? For the same reason that Bill Clinton's reckless influence-peddling goes uniformly uncriticized inside the Democratic Party. Because that's the price of Mr. Clinton forgetting what a Clinton presidency was all about.He enacted welfare reform. He spoke enthusiastically of fully funded personal Social Security accounts. He speculated about the possibility of converting Medicare into a means-tested program of private insurance vouchers.This Bill Clinton you don't hear from anymore. One could easily forget he's not only the last, but the most prominent, of the once-numerous Blue Dog Democrats, who did not make a profession, as their party does now, of ignoring the long-term funding dilemma of the U.S. retirement programs.Mr. Sanders, far from being a radical departure, is merely a perfection of what Democrats have offered since the Clinton era, namely denial.Ignore the problem. If forced to acknowledge it, insist there's no problem because the rich will pay. In the meantime, savage every reform proposal as an attack on ""unmet needs."" Collect the political rents from serving as defender of every spending interest in our overcommitted republic.When pressed, even Bernie admits that some additional, unspecified ""political revolution"" would be necessary before his socialist plans became actionable in America. Meanwhile, what would a President Bernie do in office? You already have the answer.With the latest report of the Social Security and Medicare Trustees, the programs' unfunded liabilities, in present value terms, are $60 trillion. The worker-to-retiree ratio, which was 5.0 when Medicare was created in the mid-1960s, today is 2.5, and headed for less than 2.0 after 2030. Left out of this calculation, of course, is the growing rank of non-retired entitlement recipients whom taxpayers must also support.You don't hear about any of this from Democrats. One reason is that Bill Clinton, the most active, ubiquitous of our ex-presidents, has utterly dropped the subject in return for his party's indulgence of his fundraising that knows no limits, and no concern about propriety or conflicts of interest.You don't hear much about it from Republicans either. The Bill Clinton years may leave much to be criticized, but when both parties acknowledged a reality, there was at least a chance of doing something about it. That ended in 2000, when fully one-fifth of Al Gore's convention delegates were public-sector union representatives, placed there to quash any mention of entitlement reform in the Democratic platform.And that suits a lot of Democrats just fine, including Bernie, who, for all his exotic pretenses, is just another machine Democrat.Credit: By Holman W.

"The Damage Bernie's Hillary Bashing May Do; Damage from attacks is starting to matter, especially in Clinton's standing with independent voters",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781663118?accountid=12768,"As the big New York primary election arrives, it would be a mistake to say the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination is dragging on with no end in sight. Despite tightening poll numbers, it's dragging on with a likely end still in sight: Hillary Clinton prevailing, both in New York and nationwide, because the delegate math works inexorably in her favor.So the question increasingly is this: How much damage is she absorbing at the hands of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the meantime?The answer: The damage is hardly fatal but it is starting to matter, especially in Mrs. Clinton's standing with crucial independent voters. The specific problem isn't merely that Mr. Sanders's tone has turned more harsh in attacking her. The particular problem is that his critique increasingly focuses on declaring she can't be trusted because she takes campaign contributions from big banks and big business. That is a line of attack that seems almost designed to hit Mrs. Clinton in her area of greatest vulnerability, which is voter doubts about her honesty and trustworthiness. The pattern continued Monday when the Sanders campaign accused the Clinton camp of possibly violating campaign-finance laws, prompting Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook to declare that ""the Sanders campaign's false attacks have gotten out of hand.""Of course, this is the stage of a tough election race when it's common for partisans in either party--or this year, in both parties--to lament that a bruising primary season is hurting their chances for victory in the general election. And frequently those concerns turn out to be overblown. Certainly Democrats lamented the length and tone of the long Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton fight in 2008, and that fight turned out to be, if anything, helpful in tuning up Mr. Obama for a big November win.More* Poll: Clinton Lead Over Sanders Narrows* Front-Runners Increasingly Unpopular* The Place That Most Wants Trump* Trump Card: GOP Voters Don't Want a 'White Knight'""I think Sanders is hurting Clinton with Republicans--but they wouldn't have voted for her anyway,"" says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ""With Democrats and independents the effect is minimal. So real impact is marginal at best.""Still, there is impact, as suggested by some readings inside a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. In that survey, the share of voters who hold a negative view of Mrs. Clinton continues to grow.Perhaps of most concern to Democrats are the signs of souring views among independent voters. In January, the share of independent voters who had positive views of Mrs. Clinton stood at 35%, while 54% had negative views. In the new survey, just 20% of independent voters had positive views, while 62% had negative views.There even is evidence of damage among soft Democrats--that is, people who lean Democratic but aren't core partisans. Among that group, the share holding negative views of Mrs. Clinton grew to 32% this month from 21% in January.Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster, thinks the ""aggressive"" Sanders tone is likely to backfire with Democratic women, who make up 59% of the party's primary voters. But she also worries it is eroding one of the party's key advantages this year.""Originally I think Sanders played an important role mobilizing voters and articulating an important economic and change message,"" she says. ""I think voters found refreshing the contrast with the Republicans of two candidates engaged in serious conversation about our country's future and offering a real platform. Now with ridiculous, overstated attacks like Hillary isn't qualified it makes us look as bad as the Republicans and turns off voters.""The tone problem for the party was on full display at a big Sanders rally in New York City last week, where one speaker, health-care activist Dr. Paul Song, said liberals' goal of achieving Medicare for all won't happen ""if we continue to elect corporate Democratic whores who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry.""Dr. Song later apologized and said he was referring to Democrats in Congress, not to Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Sanders said the remarks were ""inappropriate.""Still, the tone is the sort of thing that could give moderate Republicans who might otherwise never vote for businessman Donald Trump a reason to think about doing exactly that.It's also rhetoric consistent with Mr. Sanders's broader critique--she's a captive of special interests who will abandon average folks, on their behalf--which threatens to exacerbate Mrs. Clinton's biggest problem, which is that many voters suspect she isn't to be trusted. In the new Journal/NBC News poll, just 19% gave her good marks for being ""honest and straightforward.""Mrs. Clinton appears to have the upper hand in a general-election matchup against either Mr. Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But in either case, she'll need Sanders voters to show up for her in the fall. And it appears that in a matchup against Mr. Trump, a fair share of her vote would come from people embracing her as the lesser of two evils.The problem with the Sanders attacks is he is close to portraying her as at least representing a kind of evil in the system, which threatens to erode that particular advantage.Write to Gerald F.

Bernie Sanders Makes Bold--and Risky--Moves Before New York Primary; Democratic presidential candidate plans trip to Vatican conference and harshly attacks Hillary Clinton and her husband,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780643093?accountid=12768,"ALBANY, N.Y.--Sen. Bernie Sanders is taking some of the boldest and potentially riskiest steps of his campaign ahead of the crucial New York primary , hoping to raise his profile and undercut Hillary Clinton's support among voters who are a key part of the Democratic electorate.After his debate with the Democratic presidential front-runner on Thursday, Mr. Sanders will leave the U.S. to appear at an academic conference at the Vatican devoted to themes of economic and social justice. Both issues are at the core of Mr. Sanders's message. But some Democrats are baffled as to why he would drop off the campaign trail for two days before the April 19 primary , where more delegates are at stake than in any other state save California.""My advice to Bernie would be: 'Don't go to the other side of the Hudson River. Stay here where you belong,' ""said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based Democratic strategist not aligned with either candidate.Leading up to the primary, Mr. Sanders has also escalated criticism of both Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who remains a popular figure in the party. Only 9% of Democrats said they viewed Mr. Clinton negatively in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in February.Appearing in New York's Harlem neighborhood last week, Mr. Sanders said at a forum devoted to race relations that the welfare overhaul signed by Mr. Clinton in 1996 was a campaign ploy to win voters at the expense of the poorest Americans.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* What to Watch in Thursday's Democratic Debate* Prosecutors Won't Charge Trump Campaign Manager With Battery* Where Trump Resonates, He Is Embraced Down-Ballot* Oregon's Merkley Becomes First Senator to Endorse Sanders* John Kasich Sees a Path Through the Northeast* Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Hold Strong Leads in New York Ahead of Primary, Poll Finds (April 11)""Bernie is a fighter, and he understands clearly what he needs to do to move forward,"" said Gary De Carolis, an ally when Mr. Sanders was mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s. ""He will be tougher and tougher on the issues that he thinks [Mrs. Clinton] is vulnerable on.""In campaign stops in New York, Mr. Sanders has grown more caustic about the six-figure fees Mrs. Clinton earned in speeches to New York financial firms. ""Not bad for a day's work,"" he said at a recent rally in Albany. He is taking aim at what polls show is one of Mrs. Clinton's biggest points of vulnerability: perceptions that she is too close to Wall Street.At a recent speech in Rochester, he faulted her for benefiting from super PACs that take money from financial interests. Wall Street has given more than $17 million to outside groups backing her, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.""Our job is to stand up to these powerful special interests, not to take their money,"" Mr. Sanders said.Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said Mr. Sanders's latest tactics undercut his vow to focus his campaign on issues. ""In the last week, Sen. Sanders has questioned Hillary Clinton's qualifications, her judgment and most recently her credibility,"" he said. ""If that doesn't amount to a personal attack, I don't know what does.""The moves by Mr. Sanders could test Democratic unity. Should she win the nomination, Mrs. Clinton will need to rally Sanders supporters and create a united front against Republicans in the general election. But Mr. Sanders's attacks are resonating with his voters. At rallies, he typically doesn't step in and try to silence the crowd when they start to boo at the mention of her name.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll this month showed that 30% of Sanders supporters in New York said they wouldn't back Mrs. Clinton in the general election.Mr. Sanders's moves come at a make-or-break point in his candidacy. He continues to draw boisterous crowds of young supporters. On Wednesday, he picked up endorsements from New York City's transit union and also Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon. Mr. Merkley becomes the first of Mr. Sanders's Senate colleagues to endorse him. He represents the sort of predominately white, Western state where Mr. Sanders performs well.Despite winning eight of the last nine contests , Mr. Sanders hasn't put Mrs. Clinton's lead in jeopardy . A preliminary Associated Press tally shows that in what has been his most successful stretch, the last nine contests have only cut into her lead by 71 pledged delegates. Mrs. Clinton currently enjoys a lead of 251 pledged delegates. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report estimates that Mr. Sanders would need to win 56% of the remaining pledged delegates to close the gap.That makes the New York primary close to a must-win proposition for Mr. Sanders, some Democrats say.Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist who isn't aligned with either candidate, said: ""For Bernie to have any hope of ultimately prevailing, he's got to start winning every big state by big margins. If he doesn't win New York, he's going to soon look like a spoiler and not an insurgent.""People close to Mr. Sanders say he has no interest in playing that role--weakening Mrs. Clinton to the point that she might lose in November.John Franco, a longtime friend of Mr. Sanders, said in an interview that he recalled an early discussion in which Mr. Sanders made clear he didn't want to be a ""spoiler."" ""That conversation was settled in five minutes,"" Mr. Franco said.Another possibility is that Mr. Sanders, should he fail to close the gap, could become something of a spokesman for liberal goals and causes, having mobilized voters who aren't moved by the more pragmatic vision outlined by Mrs. Clinton.Tad Devine, a senior strategist for Mr. Sanders, struck a wistful note in describing the enthusiasm Mr. Sanders has kindled. Addressing a panel at the National Action Network in New York on Wednesday, Mr. Devine compared Mr. Sanders to another insurgent candidate: not Barack Obama, who won in 2008, but to Jesse Jackson, who lost the nomination twice in the 1980s.""I think when it's over, people will understand he's made a very important contribution by bringing literally millions of people into the process the way Rev. Jackson did when he ran for president,"" Mr. Devine said.Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/19/16
Bernie Blocks the FDA -- and Shows the Folly of Single Payer,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764828666?accountid=12768,"By advocating ""Medicare for all,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders has rekindled the progressive dream of government-run health care. Yet Washington can't even manage the health bureaucracy it already controls. Take a look at the sad circus surrounding the doctor nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration -- a qualified man whose confirmation is being blocked for political reasons.Last September the White House nominated Robert Califf, an FDA deputy commissioner since early 2015. Previously a heart specialist at Duke University's prestigious medical school, Dr. Califf has directed many clinical trials of drugs under evaluation for FDA approval. He has also sat on several FDA advisory committees. It is difficult to imagine a better candidate to lead the FDA through the serious reforms it desperately needs.Yet politics have prevailed over common sense. Dr. Califf's confirmation is being blocked by a ""hold,"" a procedural maneuver that allows a single senator to prevent his colleagues from considering a nomination. Who has put a hold on Dr. Califf? None other than Bernie Sanders.""Dr. Califf's extensive ties to the pharmaceutical industry give me no reason to believe that he would make the FDA work for ordinary Americans, rather than just the CEOs of pharmaceutical companies,"" Sen. Sanders said last month in a statement. ""We need someone who will work to substantially lower drug prices, implement rules to safely import brand-name drugs from Canada and hold companies accountable who defraud our government.""These allegations are misleading. The FDA's statutory mandate is to review clinical trials submitted by manufacturers and approve drugs for use based on their therapeutic effectiveness and safety. The commissioner has no authority to regulate drug prices. Nor can he, by administrative fiat, alter the laws governing the importation of drugs from abroad.Even if the commissioner had such powers, using them would be a huge mistake. Developing new drugs is tremendously difficult and risky. Since 1950, the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars of research has fallen 80-fold, halving about every nine years, according to a 2012 study in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. The profound complexity of biology ensures that only about one of every 10 drugs in development will eventually gain approval.Imposing price controls in the U.S. -- or allowing importation of cheap drugs from Canada, which controls prices -- would greatly decrease the return that manufacturers receive for undertaking risky drug development. Many would scale back new research. Pharmaceutical innovation would slow to a crawl.That said, an FDA commissioner like Dr. Califf could help patients in real ways, contrary to Sen. Sanders's aspersions. A commissioner with experience in the industry and clinical research could streamline the process and expedite the approval of lifesaving drugs. He would also be equipped to uncover and redress any questionable industry practices.Even the editors of the New England Journal of Medicine, hardly friends of the pharmaceutical industry, have urged the Senate to confirm Dr. Califf ""as quickly as possible."" Their extensive investigation of his published studies from industry-sponsored drug trials found no evidence of favoritism. Given his record, the editors wrote, ""it is impossible to argue that Califf has a pro-industry bias.""Sen. Sanders isn't alone in blocking Dr. Califf. Sen. Edward Markey (D, Mass.) has also placed a hold on the nomination. Citing widespread opioid addiction, Mr. Markey demands that the FDA reconsider its 2015 guidelines on the pediatric use of prescription opioids. Abuse of opioids is indeed serious. But Sen. Markey's maneuver is pure grandstanding: Pediatricians have always been able to prescribe opioids for their patients. All the FDA did was establish recommendations for how to administer OxyContin to teenage patients suffering from severe, otherwise untreatable pain.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) says she will hold Dr. Califf's nomination until the FDA agrees to require labeling for genetically modified salmon. She is pandering to her home state's fishing industry.This mess provides a window into what a completely government-run health-care system would look like. Politicians would have license to micromanage the drugs and services that physicians provide and patients receive. The popular passions of the day would trump science. That isn't a future anyone should fight for.---Dr. Zinberg is a practicing surgeon and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

"Declarations: Trump, Sanders and the American Rebellion",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764828430?accountid=12768,"What is happening in American politics?We're in the midst of a rebellion. The bottom and middle are pushing against the top. It's a throwing off of old claims and it's been going on for a while, but we're seeing it more sharply after New Hampshire. This is not politics as usual, which by its nature is full of surprise. There's something deep, suggestive, even epochal about what's happening now.I have thought for some time that there's a kind of soft French Revolution going on in America, with the angry and blocked beginning to push hard against an oblivious elite. It is not only political. Yes, it is about the Democratic National Committee, that house of hacks, and about a Republican establishment owned by the donor class. But establishment journalism, which for eight months has been simultaneously at Donald Trump's feet (""Of course you can call us on your cell from the bathtub for your Sunday show interview!"") and at his throat (""Trump supporters, many of whom are nativists and nationalists . . .""), is being rebelled against too. Their old standing as guides and gatekeepers? Gone, and not only because of multiplying platforms. Gloria Steinem thought she owned feminism, thought she was feminism. She doesn't and isn't. The Clintons thought they owned the party -- they don't. Hedge-funders thought they owned the GOP. Too bad they forgot to buy the base!All this goes hand in hand with the general decline of America's faith in its institutions. We feel less respect for almost all of them -- the church, the professions, the presidency, the Supreme Court. The only formal national institution that continues to score high in terms of public respect (72% in the most recent Gallup poll) is the military.A few years ago I gave a lecture to a class at West Point, the text of which was: You are entering the only U.S. institution left standing. Your prime responsibility throughout your careers will be to keep it respected. I then told them about the Dreyfus case. They had not heard of it. I explained how that scandal rocked public faith in a previously exalted institution, the French army, doing it and France lasting damage. And so your personal integrity is of the utmost importance, I said, as day by day that integrity creates the integrity of the military. The cadets actually listened to that part.I mention this to say we are in a precarious position in the U.S. with so many of our institutions going down. Many of those pushing against the system have no idea how precarious it is or what they will be destroying. Those defending it don't know how precarious its position is or even what they're defending, or why. But people lose respect for a reason.To New Hampshire: The rejection of the establishment's preferred candidates in both major parties is a big moment. It is also understandable, the result of 15 years of failed presidencies. It is a gesture of rebuke toward the political class -- move aside.It's said this is the year of anger but there's a kind of grim practicality to Trump and Sanders supporters. They're thinking: Let's take a chance. Washington is incapable of reform or progress; it's time to reach outside. Let's take a chance on an old Brooklyn socialist. Let's take a chance on the casino developer who talks on TV.In doing so, they accept a decline in traditional political standards. You don't have to have a history of political effectiveness anymore; you don't even have to have run for office! ""You're so weirdly outside the system, you may be what the system needs.""They are pouring their hope into uncertain vessels, and surely know it. Bernie Sanders is an actual radical: He would fundamentally change an economic system that imperfectly but for two centuries made America the wealthiest country in the history of the world. In the young his support is understandable: They have never been taught anything good about capitalism and in their lifetimes have seen it do nothing -- nothing -- to protect its own reputation.It is middle-aged Sanders supporters who are more interesting. They know what they're turning their backs on. They know they're throwing in the towel. My guess is they're thinking something like: Don't aim for great now, aim for safe. Terrorism, a world turning upside down, my kids won't have it better -- let's just try to be safe, more communal.---A shrewdness in Sanders and Trump backers: They share one faith in Washington, and that is in its ability to wear anything down. They think it will moderate Bernie, take the edges off Trump. For this reason they don't see their choices as so radical.As for Mr. Trump, it is not without meaning that his supporters have had eight months to measure the cost of satisfying their anger by voting for him. In New Hampshire, 35% of the electorate decided that for all his drama and uncertainty they would back him.The mainstream journalistic mantra is that the GOP is succumbing to nativism, nationalism and the culture of celebrity. That allows them to avoid taking seriously Mr. Trump's issues: illegal immigration and Washington's 15-year, bipartisan refusal to stop it; political correctness and how it is strangling a free people; and trade policies that have left the American working class displaced, adrift and denigrated. Mr. Trump's popularity is propelled by those issues and enabled by his celebrity.In winning, Donald Trump threw over the GOP donor class. Political professionals don't fully appreciate that, but normal Americans see it. They get that the guy with money just slapped silly the guys with money. Every hedge-fund billionaire donor should be blinking in pain. Some investment!This leads me to Citizens United. Conservatives applauded that Supreme Court decision because it allowed Republicans to counter the effect of union money that goes to Democrats. But Citizens United gave the rich too much sway in the GOP. The party was better off when it relied on Main Street. It meant they had to talk to Main Street.Mr. Trump is a clever man with his finger on the pulse, but his political future depends on two big questions. The first is: Is he at all a good man? Underneath the foul-mouthed flamboyance is he in it for America? The second: Is he fully stable? He acts like a nut, calling people bimbos, flying off the handle with grievances. Is he mature, reliable? Is he at all a steady hand?Political professionals think these are side questions. ""Let's accuse him of not being conservative!"" But they are the issue. Because America doesn't deliberately elect people it thinks base, not to mention crazy.Anyway, we are in some kind of moment. Congratulations to the establishments of both parties for getting us here. They are the authors of the rebellion; they are a prime thing being rebelled against.Connected to that, something I've noticed. In Washington there used to be a widespread cliche: ""God protects drunks, children and the United States of America."" I'm in Washington a lot, and I've noticed no one says that anymore. They stopped 10 or 15 years ago. I wonder what that means.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",4/19/16
Election 2016: GOP Groups Target Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764828411?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton has long been the subject of Republican attacks. It looks like rival Bernie Sanders may soon start to feel the burn, too.It's a perverse sort of compliment, really. Republican super PACs say they are now taking the Vermont senator seriously enough to attack him. The attacks focus on the fact that Mr. Sanders is a democratic socialist, though they generally leave out the ""democratic"" part.That would be a significant vulnerability for Mr. Sanders in a general election, but competing for liberal voters in a Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton hasn't touched it. A Boston Globe poll last weekend found that nearly a third of Democratic voters in New Hampshire said the term ""socialist"" applied to them.Not necessarily so with the larger electorate. On Wednesday, the day after Mr. Sanders's resounding victory in the New Hampshire primary, Tom Donohue, president of the Chamber of Commerce, posted his ""thoughts"" about Mr. Sanders's victory to the Chamber's website. He declared the senator's economic views to be wholly ""misguided.""""Socialism is a wrong and dangerous path for America. It's failed everywhere it's ever been tried, bringing shared misery instead of shared prosperity,"" he wrote.That is downright quaint compared with a digital ad released Thursday from the Republican group America Rising Squared, a nonprofit organization that doesn't have to disclose its donors.The ad repeatedly uses the word ""socialist"" and uses ominous images of war, Soviet flags and terrorists to paint a frightening picture of America under Mr. Sanders. It shows a younger Mr. Sanders praising Cuba's Fidel Castro and airs recent footage of him saying, ""We will raise taxes, yes we will.""And on Friday, the super PAC Future45 released an ad to run on cable television nationally and in Nevada. The ad actually advertises some of the ideas that Mr. Sanders is proud of: a $15 minimum wage, a higher taxes on banks and corporations and free (the ad puts ""free"" into quotes) college and health care.Some GOP groups have been airing TV ads that are actually meant to boost Mr. Sanders at the expense of Mrs. Clinton. But this time, Future45 says it is aiming at the Vermont senator, fearful he will skate by for too long without criticism from the right.""No one took Obama seriously at first when he ran in 2008,"" said Dan Conston, senior adviser to Future 45, ""and we're not going to make that mistake.""Credit: By Laura Meckler",4/19/16
Election 2016: Sanders Benefits From Super PAC --- Senator gets funds from group backed by nurse's union attends retreats with donors,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764828363?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- In nearly every speech, Bernie Sanders reminds voters that he doesn't have a super PAC, doesn't want money from Wall Street and rejects establishment politics.Yet the Vermont senator has benefited from at least $1.5 million in backing from super PACs and from political groups that don't have to fully disclose their donors, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.As a member of Congress, he regularly attended retreats with Wall Street lobbyists and other donors, and as a candidate for the Senate, he benefited from money that indirectly came from them. Last year, he directly accepted about $55,000 in Wall Street contributions for his Democratic presidential campaign, FEC filings show.To be sure, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has raised far more from Wall Street donors, taking in $2.9 million last year, and the super PACs helping her collected $14.3 million from financial firms, about 30% of their total haul, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. She has helped raise money for her primary super PAC, while Mr. Sanders hasn't raised funds for outside groups.Mrs. Clinton says outside contributions supporting her campaign don't influence her judgment. Mr. Sanders says that, for him, such contributions don't exist. ""I'm the only candidate up here . . . who has no super PAC,"" he said Thursday during a Democratic debate.He may not have formed one of his own, but Mr. Sanders is getting help from National Nurses United for Patient Protection, a super PAC that gets its money from the nation's largest nurses' union, with nearly 185,000 members.The union doesn't have to disclose its donors, but a spokesman said the super PAC money comes exclusively from members' dues. Representatives from the union have frequently joined the senator at events, and this week launched a bus tour across South Carolina ahead of the state's Feb. 27 primary. At an Iowa campaign stop, Mr. Sanders thanked the group for being ""one of the sponsors"" of his campaign.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said labor unions have long worked for candidates. ""You're talking about nurses, nurses, one of the most trusted professions in the country,"" he said, ""versus millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street.""The battle over the influence of special interests began in earnest in New Hampshire. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton drew attention to Mr. Sanders's 2006 race for the Senate, when he benefited from $200,000 in contributions from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, known as the DSCC, which is charged with electing Democrats -- and accepts significant contributions from Wall Street interests.""Sen. Sanders took $200,000 from Wall Street firms, not directly but through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee,"" she told a rally in Manchester.Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver responded by pointing to much larger Wall Street contributions benefiting Mrs. Clinton. He said the money from the DSCC comes from many places, including individuals, labor and environmental groups. ""To say that every nickel that Bernie received came from Wall Street is beyond preposterous,"" said Mr. Weaver.Five of the top 20 givers to the DSCC in the 2006 election cycle were Wall Street firms, two were law firms and the rest were senators' political committees.Mr. Sanders has also regularly attended the DSCC's retreats, either during the winter in Florida or during summer on Martha's Vineyard, including one as recently as July. Guests are donors who have donated the maximum amount to the party, or raised more than $100,000. Many attendees are lobbyists, lawyers and members of the financial industry.Several donors who have attended said Mr. Sanders fully participated, and didn't take the opportunity to tell Wall Street lobbyists that, as he says on the stump, their industry's business model is fraud.""He was just like any other senator hobnobbing with lawyers and lobbyists from D.C.,"" said Rebecca Geller, a Washington attorney who attended with her husband, a financial services lobbyist. Ms. Geller, who has donated to Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said Mr. Sanders was happy to take photos with her family. ""My kids have fond memories of him hanging out by the hot tub.""Credit: By Laura Meckler and Rebecca Ballhaus",4/19/16
Cardinal Bernie; Sanders won't like what a papal encyclical says about socialism.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781452790?accountid=12768,"In the 1600s the sculptor Bernini had Pope Urban VIII as his benefactor. Today Bernie Sanders wants to claim Pope Francis. In the pope's second foray into American presidential politics--the first was to suggest Donald Trump is not a Christian--Francis met with the Democratic Party's socialist underdog on Saturday.Mr. Sanders's audience was granted after he participated in a Vatican conference celebrating the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's encyclical Centesimus Annus. In his remarks on the encyclical, Mr. Sanders used his Vatican pulpit to declare that ""the issue of wealth and income inequality"" is ""the great moral issue of our time.""The irony is that Senator Sanders seems to be completely unaware that Centesimus Annus was one of the most pro-market documents ever to come out of the Vatican. While it certainly carries warnings about a capitalism unbounded by law and a healthy culture, it also spoke eloquently of the ""human rights to private initiative, to ownership of property and to freedom in the economic sector."" It also recognized that the ultimate source of wealth is not material but the human mind.As for socialism, the encyclical was unsparing. Pope John Paul II agreed with earlier popes that socialism fails as a political system because it is rooted in the denial of freedom. So perhaps it's useful for Mr. Sanders to spend time with Centesimus Annus, assuming he reads enough to see its denunciations of socialism and appreciation for what human creativity can accomplish in a free-market economy.",4/20/16
Bernie Sanders Releases 2014 Federal Tax Return; Release fulfills promise Vermont senator made during debate with Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781251116?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders fulfilled a debate promise, releasing a seven-page federal tax return from 2014 on Friday evening.The Vermont senator has been feuding with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over transparency. Mr. Sanders has called on Mrs. Clinton to provide transcripts of her paid speeches to big Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs, which she was refused to do. She has challenged Mr. Sanders to release years of back tax information.Mr. Sanders agreed in Thursday's Brooklyn debate to provide his 2014 returns, calling them ""very boring.""Mrs. Clinton has released eight years of full tax information on her website. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has provided no tax information, while Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich have released partial returns for several years.Mr. Sanders produced a two-page summary of his 2014 tax information in June. Friday's release gave a fuller account of his federal taxes for the same year. He didn't release any state-level tax information.The 2014 return added context to Mr. Sanders's charitable contributions and his wife's business income.The returns show that Mr. Sanders gave $8,350 to charity. The returns don't list the recipients.The return also showed Jane Sanders earning $4,900 for her work as a commissioner on the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Commission.The family earned $156,411 in wages and collected an additional $39,281 in Social Security benefits. They paid $27,653 for an effective tax rate of 13.5%.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Byron Tau",4/20/16
Bernie Sanders Faces a Daunting Task: Win Black Votes; Lack of support in key group threatens to sink Democrat's presidential campaign against rival Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782322865?accountid=12768,"Coming off a lopsided loss in New York , Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign team pointed to an enduring problem that could sink his struggling presidential bid if it isn't fixed: his failure to win over more African-American voters.Black voters in New York on Tuesday were nearly a quarter of the Democratic electorate and favored Hillary Clinton by a 50-point margin, exit polls showed, locking in a victory that gives her a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates.""I am hopeful going forward we will do better,"" said Tad Devine, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Sanders. ""And we know we must. We're not going to win New Jersey unless we improve our numbers with African-American voters.""Meanwhile, some Democrats worry the increasingly harsh tone of the campaign could make it tougher to unify the party for the general election, but it isn't clear the feuding will end anytime soon.During the course of his campaign, Mr. Sanders has tried to make inroads with African-Americans, showcasing endorsements from black celebrities, intellectuals and civil-rights activists. But the outreach isn't paying dividends at the polls.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Analysis: Presidential Front-Runners Get Breathing Room After New York Vote* Hillary Clinton Ends Sanders's Winning Streak With N.Y.

Aside from California and Pennsylvania, the two states that offer the most delegates through the rest of the calendar are Maryland and New Jersey. In the 2008 Democratic primary, blacks accounted for 23% of Democratic voters in New Jersey, 37% in Maryland.The Sanders campaign is trying again to reach out to black voters. On Wednesday, it released two new TV ads that will air in Maryland targeting black voters. One spot features African-American actor Danny Glover vouching for Mr. Sanders's commitment to civil rights. ""I think Bernie is with us,"" Mr. Glover says.The day after the New York primary was fairly quiet. Mr. Sanders went home to Burlington, Vt. Mrs. Clinton held a forum about gun violence in Philadelphia that featured former Attorney General Eric Holder and several African-American women who have lost children in shootings or police custody.Mrs. Clinton's 16-point win in New York left both campaigns with a new set of strategic decisions to make. In the run-up to the New York primary, Mr. Sanders said repeatedly that he would win the state. Inside the campaign, aides anticipated a loss in New York, though they believed the margin would be closer, Mr. Devine said.With Mrs. Clinton netting 33 more delegates in New York--and five states, including Maryland, voting next Tuesday--the Sanders campaign must rethink the path needed to close the gap with Mrs. Clinton, he said.The hurdle is daunting. David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report estimated that Mr. Sanders needs to capture 59% of the remaining pledged delegates to erase Mrs. Clinton's lead.""We're going to have to win, and we're going to have to win big,"" Mr. Devine said. ""New York was a setback in terms of the scope of her victory. ... We're trying to figure out a realistic way to win this.""For her part, Mrs. Clinton must decide when to shift focus from Mr. Sanders to her likely showdown with the Republican nominee in the fall. People familiar with her campaign's thinking on that question said not to expect Mrs. Clinton to move into a general-election posture before the five contests next Tuesday.Another question for both campaigns is what to do about a tone that has become caustic. Robert Reich, a Sanders supporter who served as labor secretary under former President Bill Clinton, posted a message on Facebook calling on both campaigns to knock it off.""We will need to join together to ensure one of them becomes president,"" he wrote. ""It's important we not jeopardize that future joint effort through excessive divisiveness now.""A similar dynamic played out in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton lost the nomination to then-Sen. Barack Obama. Sending a message to her disappointed supporters, Mrs. Clinton quit the race and then campaigned with her rival in a New Hampshire town called Unity. Mr. Obama hired members of her defunct campaign team in a step toward reconciliation.Mr. Sanders says he is determined to fight until the final contest in Washington, D.C., on June 14.On Wednesday, the Sanders campaign sent out a fund-raising appeal based on a report in Politico that a Clinton campaign aide used an obscenity in discussing Mr. Sanders.""Let's send our own message back to the Clinton campaign in a language they're certain to understand,"" wrote Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, requesting a donation.Clinton allies believe Mr. Sanders is the one instigating the attacks. A Senate colleague of Mr. Sanders, Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said Mr. Sanders should tone down his rhetoric.""He's never had a negative campaign, he's said, and he's never run a negative ad, and I think he's losing touch with that,"" Mr. Reid said when asked whether Mr. Sanders's attacks were damaging Mrs. Clinton.Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/21/16
Hillary Clinton Wins New York's Democratic Primary; Front-runner's home-state victory makes it more unlikely Bernie Sanders can catch her in the delegate chase,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782020119?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton decisively won her home-state New York primary Tuesday, shutting down one of the few remaining chances for rival Bernie Sanders to slow her march to the Democratic presidential nomination.Mr. Sanders had pointed to New York, where he was born, as a place where he could take a bite out of Mrs. Clinton's formidable lead in convention delegates. He campaigned hard in what became a sharp-edged fight for the state, delivering his call for a political revolution to thousands of people who crowded a series of outdoor rallies.But Mrs. Clinton, who represented the state for eight years in the Senate, racked up impressive vote totals in New York City, with its diverse electorate, and in its populous suburban counties. Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, performed better upstate.With 95% of precincts reporting, Mrs. Clinton had a commanding 58% of the vote to Mr. Sanders's 42%.""The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight!"" Mrs. Clinton told cheering supporters Tuesday in New York City, appearing on stage with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who campaigned heavily on her behalf.She focused sharply on the general election ahead, said almost nothing critical of Mr. Sanders and began what may be a long process of unifying the party around her.

But if Mrs. Clinton backs off him, they said, he may do the same.The delegate math is steeply against Mr. Sanders. He came into the New York contest having won eight of the past nine contests and drawing tens of thousands of people to his rallies. But his delegate gain from those mostly small-state victories was modest.Heading into New York's voting, Mrs. Clinton had an advantage of 244 pledged delegates, the type chosen by voters, according to preliminary Associated Press tallies.Overall, she had 1,289 pledged delegates, and when you include superdelegates--party leaders who can support anyone--supporting her, Mrs. Clinton's total jumped to 1,758 to his 1,076. A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to claim the nomination.Mrs. Clinton has won most of the large, diverse states, and the Vermont senator's recent wins have done little to cut into a yawning delegate deficit. Now just three large states remain on the Democratic calendar--Pennsylvania next week, and California and New Jersey in June.The victory was a relief for Mrs. Clinton, who campaigned hard to avoid what would have been an embarrassing loss, even one that may not have prevented her from winning the nomination.Mr. Sanders faced tough odds from the outset, in part because the state has a large proportion of nonwhite voters, who have generally favored Mrs. Clinton. In addition, New York barred independents, who have been friendly to Mr. Sanders, from voting in party primaries, and it required voters who wanted to switch party affiliation to do so six months ago.But ahead of the results, top Sanders advisers said the senator had no plans to take the pressure off his Democratic rival as long as she keeps up her critiques of the Vermont senator.""We have received a lot of innuendo and dismissiveness and demeaning comments from the Clinton campaign--from the secretary herself and from her surrogates,"" Jane Sanders, the candidate's wife and a close adviser, said in an interview. ""He's not going to sit by and just not respond.""Clinton advisers are hoping the New York victory will allow the former secretary of state to turn her attention away from the primary race and to the fall contest. For many weeks, Mrs. Clinton has taken shots at her GOP opponents, but Mr. Sanders's strength has forced her to keep much of her focus on the primary.""You have to unify the party, and you don't want to prematurely look past someone who has earned a lot of votes and put up a strong fight,"" one senior adviser said. ""The timing is everything.""During the campaign for New York, the Vermont senator ramped up his attacks on his rival. He aired a TV ad contrasting his rival's high-paid Wall Street speeches with her opposition to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. (Mrs. Clinton supports a $12 federal floor.)Mr. Sanders also said her positions made her unqualified for the presidency, though he quickly backed away from that assertion .Mrs. Clinton also was tough, particularly on the issue of gun restrictions, suggesting Mr. Sanders isn't being truthful about his record and accusing him of personally blocking a lawsuit by families of children killed in the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Conn.Sanders senior adviser Tad Devine said Mrs. Clinton and her supporters have the power to change the tenor of the race. ""If the Clinton campaign stops their attacks, that will go a long way to changing the tone,"" he said after the race was called.Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said Tuesday night that in light of Mrs. Clinton's dominant position, Mr. Sanders ""has to decide if he's going to stay on this destructive path where he's making personal character attacks...Or will he return to running the campaign on issues?""One Sanders adviser said that even if the senator doesn't win the nomination, he hopes that picking up as many delegates as possible would give him leverage to press his agenda at the Philadelphia convention.""Does Bernie think he can win?

Bernie Sanders. Aides say his pointed rhetoric against the former secretary of state is likely to continue, despite calls in some quarters for him to pull back.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* New York Primary: Live Coverage* Donald Trump Is Poised to Pad Delegate Lead, but Still Faces Long Road* For New Yorkers, a Rare Primary of Consequence* Voters Report Irregularities at Poll Sites* New York Primaries: Five Things to Watch* Fight Over Delegate Rules Escalates for Both PartiesMr. Sanders came into the New York contest having won eight of the last nine contests, and drawing tens of thousands of people to his rallies across the state. But his delegate gain from those mostly small-state victories was modest.Mrs. Clinton has won most of the large, diverse states, and the Vermont senator's recent wins have done little to cut into a yawning delegate deficit. After Tuesday, just three large states remain on the Democratic calendar--Pennsylvania next week , and California and New Jersey, which don't vote until June.On the Republican side, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is expected to come in a distant third behind Ohio Gov. John Kasich in New York, losing another big cache of delegates to Mr. Trump after beating him in a string of smaller states over the past month, from Utah to Wisconsin to Wyoming. He now must compete in five East Coast states next Tuesday favorable to Mr. Trump--Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. But he is counting on winning enough delegates in May to deprive the front-runner of the majority needed to clinch the nomination outright on the first ballot at the GOP convention.""Trump was expected to win his home state,"" said Cruz spokeswoman Alice Stewart of the New York contest. ""What we are about is picking up delegates.""Losing New York would make it mathematically impossible for Mr. Cruz in the remaining primaries to get to the needed 1,237 bound delegates before the July convention. But he can still pick up enough delegates to keep Mr. Trump from hitting that magic number before they get to Cleveland.Mr. Cruz scheduled his election-night rally for Philadelphia, and will then head across Pennsylvania to Hershey, signaling some hope of picking up a share of the state's 71 delegates, which will include 54 not bound to any specific candidate. But Mr. Trump has been running up big leads on the East Coast, generally too liberal to be Cruz country.Mr. Cruz's supporters--and other anti-Trump Republicans--see their next big chance for a statewide win in Indiana on May 3 and Nebraska May 10. Both are more-conservative states with large evangelical populations. Their primaries are closed, the kind of all-Republican affairs that tend to favor Mr. Cruz over Mr. Trump, who has benefited in states that allow crossover voting by Democrats and independents.""Both Indiana and Nebraska represent big opportunities"" to block Mr. Trump, said Katie Packer, chairman of the anti-Trump group, Our Principles PAC. ""The voters there look more like Iowa and Wisconsin than they do New York.""The battle for Indiana's 57 delegates is already stirring. Mr. Trump is holding a rally in Indianapolis Wednesday. Mr. Cruz appears at a state GOP dinner Thursday and his wife Heidi is making five appearances over two days later this week.Nebraska is a winner-take-all primary, which awards all 36 of the delegate slots to the candidate with the highest statewide vote total.Mr. Cruz has won the neighboring states of Iowa, Colorado and Wyoming. The state's popular junior senator, Ben Sasse, has been a vocal leader of the anti-Trump movement and announced that he had cast an early ballot for Mr. Cruz.The biggest target for Mr. Cruz and his rivals is California, which votes June 7, the last day of the primary season. The state will award the nation's largest bounty of delegates. Of the state's 172 delegates, 13 are awarded to the candidate with the most statewide votes. The rest are allocated to the winner in each congressional district.Statewide, most polls show Mr. Trump in the lead: The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls gave Mr. Trump 40.4% of the GOP primary vote in California to Mr. Cruz's 31.4 and Mr. Kasich's 15.8.But with so many delegates awarded by congressional district, the campaigns are preparing to fight over the state as an amalgam of mini-primaries. Mr. Cruz has already been to California to campaign. He has two senior advisers who are former chairmen of the California Republican Party. His Cuban family roots could give him a leg up among the state's large population of Hispanic voters, although Mr. Cruz tends not to dwell on his ethnic background.Mr. Trump's campaign is going through a shake-up, as newly hired Republican operatives Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley take more responsibility from campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Stuart Jolly, the national field director who was close to Mr. Lewandowski, resigned Monday. Mr. Jolly had never worked on a campaign before and had been asked to report to Mr. Wiley.Mr. Wiley is among the Trump officials headed to the Republican National Committee meeting this week in Florida, where officials will discuss potential rules changes to the party's convention in Cleveland.In addition to Messrs. Manafort and Wiley, the campaign is starting to hire other experienced staffers and dispatch them to states with upcoming primaries.A small band of Mr. Trump's supporters on Capitol Hill, who have begun meeting weekly, has aired concerns about the campaign's lack of expertise on convention delegates and lean budget for field operations and paid advertising.""That was a rough bump, but that transition now has been made,"" said Rep. Duncan Hunter of California. ""The Trump campaign has gone from an insurgency campaign to a more what you would think of as a normal political campaign.""A Trump spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, didn't provide any details about the staff changes. ""The campaign continues to grow as Mr. Trump remains the definitive front-runner for the Republican nomination,"" she said.Even though Mr. Trump leads in delegates and is the only candidate who could win without a contested convention, his campaign doesn't employ a scheduler--a role that in other national campaigns often requires multiple staffers. Those duties are passed off to Mr. Trump's secretaries.But with so many delegates awarded by congressional district, the campaigns are preparing to fight over the state as an amalgam of mini-primaries. Mr. Cruz has already been out to California to campaign.

Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Make Their Closing Arguments to New Yorkers; Front-runner reaches out to minorities and women; Vermont senator attracts massive crowds before Tuesday primary,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781659336?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton closed out the race for New York with an aggressive outreach to women and nonwhite voters, as she labored to put rival Bernie Sanders in the rearview mirror.Polls showed the former New York senator with a solid lead in her adopted state ahead of Tuesday's primary, though her aides cautioned the race may be tighter than those surveys would suggest. Mr. Sanders is drawing the most energetic signs of support, with 28,000 flocking to a rally in Brooklyn on Sunday, and 27,000 in Manhattan last week.More on Election 2016Capital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Live Coverage: New York Primary* Clinton's Lead Narrows Among Democratic Primary Voters, Poll Says* New Yorkers Head to the Polls on Primary Day* Trump Pushes for Big Win in New York* New York Primaries: Five Things to Watch* Republican Voters Want Say in Choosing Nominee, Poll Finds""I never count any chickens before they hatch,"" Mrs. Clinton said from the trail.With just a few large states left to vote, Mr. Sanders needs a victory here Tuesday if he is to have any chance of catching up to Mrs. Clinton's substantial delegate lead.Both candidates focused their final days around New York's five boroughs, where most of Tuesday's Democratic votes are expected to be cast. In Queens, Mrs. Clinton visited a group of mostly Hispanic carwash workers who recently formed a union, and she tried her first bubble tea as she greeted Asian voters at a food court in Flushing.On Monday evening, Mrs. Clinton greeted a mix of workers--from South Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East--at the restaurant Colors, formed by people who worked at the restaurant that once sat atop the World Trade Center.Her strongest support has come from African-American voters. At weekend events, both Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were accompanied by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who repeatedly vouched for her.Clinton aides said the issue of gun violence was particularly important in motivating black voters to the polls, and the former secretary of state hit on the topic repeatedly.At a rally aimed at women on Monday in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton cited Mr. Sanders's support for a bill that gave gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. She and then-Sen. Barack Obama voted against it, she said. ""Bernie Sanders voted for it!""""Sen. Sanders talks a lot about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street,"" she said. ""But what about the greed and recklessness of the gun manufacturers?""Mr. Sanders said in a CNN interview Monday that lawsuits, including one filed by parents of children killed in Newtown, Conn., should be allowed to proceed, but he isn't sure if they have merit. ""If I sell you a legal product, am I liable for the crazy thing that you do with it? I think not,"" he said.It isn't a topic he typically addresses on the stump. At a huge rally Sunday, he made only oblique reference to the matter. ""Our job is to give kids jobs, not guns,"" he said.Mr. Sanders has worked to cut into Mrs. Clinton's support among nonwhite voters, and his aides say he has made progress with younger African-Americans. In New York, he held events devoted to racial issues and showcased endorsements from prominent black leaders, including entertainer Harry Belafonte. On Monday, he held a roundtable discussion on Puerto Rican issues, including his view that creditors must be forced to accept lower payments to resolve the island's debt crisis.But on the eve of the New York vote, Mr. Sanders seemed to be relying more on a shock-and-awe strategy, staging huge outdoor rallies that demonstrated the grass-roots enthusiasm that his campaign has generated.Mr. Sanders spoke to thousands of supporters in Long Island City on Monday at his final rally before the New York primary. He was introduced by actor Danny Glover as ""the next president of the United States."" Mr. Sanders said that ""if we get a large voter turnout tomorrow, we're going to win here in New York.""Earlier on Monday, Mr. Sanders led a somewhat chaotic procession through the streets of Queens, where he ambled along greeting everyone from teenage twin boys to a woman who emerged from a beauty salon, dye still in her hair.The Clinton events were generally smaller and tamer, but the campaign covered twice the ground as it deployed the former president, who put particular focus on turning out minority voters.Mr. Clinton spoke at three African-American churches on Sunday in Queens and on Long Island. Sitting in the pews at Antioch Baptist Church in Queens were six black women who lost family and loved ones to gun violence. He then led a trio of outdoor rallies in some of New York City's most diverse neighborhoods.He touched several issues of particular importance to the black community. He said police forces should more closely mirror the racial and ethnic makeup of the neighborhoods they patrol. He highlighted rising incomes for African-Americans when he was president. And Mr. Clinton called for tougher gun laws and shorter prison sentences for nonviolent offenders.At a housing complex in Queens, he was introduced by Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a leader of the civil-rights movement who was beaten during a 1965 march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala.Mr. Lewis dramatically cast the election in terms of racial progress. ""I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Alabama, for the right to vote,"" Mr. Lewis said.Erica Orden contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Peter Nicholas",4/21/16
"Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton Spar Ahead of New York Primary; Democrats exchange tough words in whirlwind campaigning across New York City",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781430356?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--The Democratic presidential candidates returned to the campaign trail Sunday in New York City for a two-day sprint to Tuesday's primary here, with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders exchanging tough words across town.By day's end, Mrs. Clinton and her husband, the former president, had between them touched all five boroughs, plus suburban spots in Westchester County and Long Island, blanketing the metro area that will deliver as much as 70% of Tuesday's vote. Along the way she danced to Latin rhythms at a campaign block party.Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, addressed a record-breaking crowd in a Brooklyn park. He also appeared at a public housing complex, released a plan for affordable housing and spoke at a Harlem church service.Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, needs a big win in New York if he is to have any chance of closing Mrs. Clinton's lead in delegates. For Mrs. Clinton, who polls show is maintaining a double-digit lead, it would be deeply embarrassing to lose in her adopted home state where she served as a senator.Both candidates were back in New York after more than a day away from the state--Mr. Sanders to the Vatican for a conference and a brief greeting with Pope Francis, and Mrs. Clinton for fundraisers including a high-dollar event at the California home of actor George Clooney.The day began with both candidates appearing on Sunday talk shows. Speaking on ABC, Mrs. Clinton sought to clarify her position when she said she backed a minimum-wage increase modeled after New York's $15-an-hour plan, which will be phased in and sensitive to local economic conditions.""We have to evaluate it as we go,"" she said. ""If the Congress passes that, of course I would sign it.""The racial diversity of the Clinton coalition was on display Sunday as she began her day at a suburban African-American church, then campaigned in the largely Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights, in northern Manhattan. Most of the politicians who preceded her spoke in Spanish to a crowd that included many people who spoke little English.""It doesn't look like a Whole Foods checkout line,"" one man at the rally, Evan Shapiro, 48, said approvingly. An adjunct professor at New York University, he also attended a huge Sanders rally near his school last week and said he was dismayed by the lack of diversity.After Mrs. Clinton's brief remarks, peppy merengue music played and the former secretary of state began bouncing to the beat. As her hands waved in the air, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat took them into his own and then twirled around her.From there, she traveled to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, where a largely African-American crowd chanted ""Madam President!""She took several shots at Mr. Sanders. ""It's easy to diagnose the problem. You've got to be able to solve the problem,"" she said. She lingered over the issue of gun control, a subject where the Clinton campaign believes Mr. Sanders is vulnerable.Speaking on Staten Island, where many victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks lived, Mrs. Clinton struck a rare but vigorous bipartisan tone, saying people in both parties worked together without question after the attacks. She singled out then-President George W. Bush for helping get the city needed funds. ""I publicly say, 'Thank you, President George W. Bush.'""Mr. Sanders on Sunday released an affordable housing plan that would expand a federal trust fund created in 2008 to finance such projects. He also called for promoting homeownership by expanding government-backed lending programs that allow borrowers to make small or no down payments.Several other proposals overlap with those that Mrs. Clinton unveiled earlier this year. Both candidates support tougher curbs on predatory lending and expanded counseling for first-time home buyers.At the center of Mrs. Clinton's plan, unveiled in February, is a $25 billion housing investment program that would build more affordable rental housing and boost homeownership for low-income Americans by matching up to $10,000 in savings for a down payment.Later in the day, Mr. Sanders addressed more than 28,000 people under the bright sun in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, in what the campaign said was a record turnout. He laid into Mrs. Clinton on the familiar issues of fracking for energy, trade, her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and the minimum wage. He said her $12 wage-floor proposal was ""not bad, but not good enough. We need to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.""Many of Mr. Sanders's events are large rallies, but on Saturday night he joined at roundtable at a Brooklyn church, where he spoke in unusually personal terms about how his fight for the poor relates to his own Brooklyn childhood, saying that there was ""constant tension"" between his parents over money.His said that a modest salary was ""pretty good"" for his father, who emigrated from Poland at age 17. But he explained, ""My mother was born in this country and her dreams were bigger.""""What I learned at a very young age was when you're a kid and hear your parents yelling at each other is a very difficult and confusing thing,"" he said.Nick Timiraos contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Erica Orden",4/21/16
"Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders Hit Hard in New York Debate; Democratic candidates clash on topics from Israel to Wall Street in possibly their most heated debate",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781046726?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--Facing a pivotal Democratic primary next week in New York , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in a debate Thursday in Brooklyn over questions of judgment and their readiness for assuming the presidency.The showdown was one of Mr. Sanders's last chances to change the trajectory of the primary race, and, egged on by a boisterous audience, he took an aggressive posture, often interrupting his rival and talking over the moderators--as did Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders hit the Democratic front-runner on a variety of familiar fronts: taking direct aim at her ties to Wall Street, her past decision-making and her more moderate policy agenda.Mrs. Clinton spent much of the evening talking up her record and that of President Barack Obama. She also cast herself as the only real Democrat in the race who has worked to help the party and other candidates.Noting that she has won more votes than Mr. Sanders and built a national campaign, she said her candidacy is one ""that will not only capture the Democratic nomination but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republicans end up nominating.""The pair disagreed sharply about Israel, with Mr. Sanders suggesting Mrs. Clinton was favoring Israel in its long-running dispute with the Palestinians.""Long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an evenhanded role,"" he said. He said that in addressing the leading U.S. lobby for Israel, Mrs. Clinton hadn't even discussed the needs of the Palestinian people.Mrs. Clinton said she does sympathize with Israelis who she said are constantly under terrorist attack, saying the nation has a right to defend itself. As president, though, she said she would be fair and cited her work as secretary of state.""I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel,"" she said, adding there were ""only four of us in the room.""The Vermont senator backed off earlier comments suggesting that the former secretary of state wasn't qualified to be president but condemned her decisions to vote for the Iraq war and to accept millions of dollars in support from super PACs. ""Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president? Of course she does,"" he said. ""But I do question her judgment.""Mrs. Clinton said the senator's recent interview with the New York Daily News editorial board revealed a lack of understanding of foreign policy and the financial industry, and that Mr. Obama's selection of her as the nation's top diplomat illustrates his faith in her leadership. ""Talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issues,"" she said. ""I think you need to have the judgment on day one.""Mr. Sanders came to the ninth Democratic debate in urgent need of a win. His path to the nomination has narrowed significantly as Mrs. Clinton has built a commanding lead in pledged delegates.A loss in Tuesday's New York primary would leave Mr. Sanders with little hope of catching Mrs. Clinton, and a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll showed her leading by 17 percentage points among likely New York Democratic primary voters.In the debate, Mr. Sanders blasted Mrs. Clinton's claim that she can rein in Wall Street banks after accepting fees and campaign donations from these interests. ""Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying she's going to bring change in America when she's so dependent on big-money interests? I don't think so,"" he said.Asked to name an example of where Wall Street money influenced Mrs. Clinton's judgment, Mr. Sanders cited the decision not to break up the banks after the financial crisis plunged the U.S. into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.But Mrs. Clinton, who wasn't in Congress at the time, shot back: ""He cannot come up with any example because there is no example.""She said that the legislative response to the banking crisis was the Dodd-Frank law, passed while she was secretary of state, and that as a senator from New York she was critical of the financial sector and called out their bad behavior.""Secretary Clinton called them out,"" Mr. Sanders replied sarcastically. ""Oh my goodness they must have been really crushed by this."" He asked if that was ""before or after"" she received large payments for speeches to Wall Street firms.Mr. Sanders has been pressing her to release transcripts of those speeches. Mrs. Clinton repeated her promise to release her transcripts when all other candidates who gave paid speeches do the same.She also asked Mr. Sanders why he hasn't released his tax returns. He said he would release his 2014 return Friday but cautioned that it would be ""very boring"" and prove he is one of the least-wealthy members of the U.S. Senate.Mr. Sanders, who is mounting an aggressive effort to court African-American voters, must cut into the constituency that has vaulted Mrs. Clinton to a big delegate lead in the Democratic presidential campaign. While that is now focused on Tuesday's primary, it could reverberate in states that will cast ballots a week after New York on April 26.African-Americans accounted for more than one-third of Democratic voters in Maryland, for example, during the 2008 primary fight between Mrs. Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama. About 20% of those who cast ballots in the party's Pennsylvania primary that year were minorities, and about 15% who voted in the New York primary that year were black, according to exit polls.In a bid to reintroduce himself, Mr. Sanders is airing two TV spots in New York featuring prominent African-Americans and showcasing endorsements from civil-rights activists.He also took aim at former President Bill Clinton over a recent clash with black protesters who objected to the crime-and-punishment practices in the 1990s. It is unclear how effective that tactic may be, given that Mr. Clinton's approval rating among all African-Americans is 89%, according to a February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Recap: Thursday's Democratic Debate in Brooklyn* Hillary Clinton Leads Bernie Sanders in New York by 17 Points Ahead of Primary, Poll Finds* How Hillary Clinton's Tone Has Shifted on Fracking* Racial Issues Take Center Stage for Sanders, Clinton in New York* Sanders, Clinton Work to Mobilize Labor Supporters* Prosecutors Won't Charge Trump Campaign Manager With Battery* Oregon's Merkley Becomes First Senator to Endorse Sanders* John Kasich Sees a Path Through the NortheastPressed during the debate, Mrs. Clinton said she was sorry for some of the unexpected ramifications of the crime bill, saying they had ""unfortunate impact"" on families. Mr. Sanders also supported the legislation.The two candidates then shifted to a caustic exchange over gun-control laws. Moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Mrs. Clinton about her statement on the trail that Vermont, with little gun control regulation, has per capita the greatest number of guns involved in crimes in New York. Was she ""seriously"" blaming Vermont for New York's gun violence? ""Of course not,"" Mrs. Clinton said, prompting a chuckle from Mr. Sanders.""It's not a laughing matter,"" Mrs. Clinton said. She said Mr. Sanders has taken the position that gun makers should be shielded from lawsuits over use of firearms.""We hear a lot from Sen. Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street...but what about the greed and recklessness of the gun manufacturers and dealers in America?"" Mrs. Clinton said.Mr. Sanders pressed her on why she made the claim that Vermont bears responsibility for gun violence in New York.""The facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state,"" Mrs. Clinton replied. ""They come from states that don't have the kind of serious efforts to control guns that we have in New York.""Hours before the Brooklyn debate, Mr. Sanders appeared at the National Action Network convention hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton, and said Republican governors around the country are using voter-suppression tactics reminiscent of the ""Jim Crow days.""Making inroads into Mrs. Clinton's advantage among African-Americans won't be easy. Another Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released earlier this week showed her with a 40-point lead among black Democrats in New York.Mrs. Clinton built her lead of 251 pledged delegates largely through decisive victories in Deep South states with large black populations, states that Mr. Sanders largely ignored. In Alabama, she took 91% of the black vote.An analysis by Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm, showed that in 21 states that have already voted, she won upward of 77% of African-Americans, compared with about 22% for Mr. Sanders.Hoping to counter Mr. Sanders's efforts, the Clinton campaign held a conference call with three Congressional Black Caucus members on Thursday during which they cast him as a late arrival to issues important to the black community.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who represents parts of New York City, said the Vermont senator hasn't done enough to address the racial disparity in his state's prison population. Vermont imprisons blacks at nearly 13 times the rate of whites, according to data compiled by the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for improvements in the criminal-justice system. That is among the most pronounced disparities in the country, according to the group's research.""On the issue of criminal-justice reform, Bernie Sanders has been all talk and no action,"" Mr. Jeffries said.Vaughn Carney is an African-American attorney in Vermont who said that he has voted for Mr. Sanders many times over the years, but that Mr. Sanders always seemed more comfortable talking about broad issues of economic class and income inequality than about race.""His feeling is that economics is the answer, and government is the answer, and that's going to solve all the racial issues,"" said Mr. Carney, a Clinton supporter. ""I don't buy that.""A Sanders campaign spokesman didn't respond to a question about Vermont's prison population.The Clintons have had decades to forge ties to African-Americans, first in Arkansas, later in the White House, and then in Mrs. Clinton's eight years as a senator from New York. By contrast, Mr. Sanders has lived most of his life in a state that is 95% white.Still, he says he is well acquainted with the struggles of African-Americans. At the Thursday event, he drew applause when he noted that in 1988, as a mayor in Vermont--""an almost all-white state then""--he supported Rev. Jesse Jackson's Democratic presidential bid. ""That wasn't a popular thing to do,"" he said.Most of Mr. Sanders's success in the presidential race has come in predominantly white states. Some African-Americans at Mr. Sanders's huge rally in Manhattan's Washington Square Park Wednesday evening said they couldn't understand why Mr. Sanders hadn't caught on more with nonwhite voters.""He's always been on the right side of history,"" said Olivier Plummer, 18 years old, of New York's Queens borough, who plans to cast his first ballot for Mr. Sanders. He carried a sign saying that he supports the Vermont senator because ""black lives always mattered--not just when it became election year.""While the candidates are also engaged in a continuing dispute over who has the stronger immigration record--an effort to appeal to Latino voters--it is in the black community where Mr. Sanders has the most work to do. One of his TV ads, produced by director Spike Lee, features prominent civil-rights activists endorsing Mr. Sanders. ""People of color have a deeply vested interest in what Bernie Sanders brings to us in this election,"" singer Harry Belafonte says. A second spot features Erica Garner, whose father, Eric, died in 2014 after a police confrontation on Staten Island. His death sparked a series of protests and political turmoil in New York.Mrs. Clinton has her own connection to the Garner family: She has received the endorsement of Mr. Garner's mother, Gwen Carr.Rebecca Ballhaus, Erica Orden and Gary Fields contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",4/21/16
Bernie and the 'Lunatic of One Idea',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765509710?accountid=12768,"In his poem ""Esthetique du Mal,"" Wallace Stevens refers, in a memorable and useful phrase, to a ""lunatic of one idea."" The phrase refuses to leave my mind whenever I hear Bernie Sanders -- and I have heard quite a lot of him in past weeks -- campaigning or debating or making, most recently, victory speeches. Mr. Sanders's one idea is what he takes to be the stark economic injustice of too few people having too much money, and through the power of their money having tilted American life in a way that is vastly unfair, unjust, flat-out morally wrong. He has repeated this one idea so often, and with such ardor in its expression, as to make Johnny One-Note look like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Mr. Sanders's synecdoche for his idea is Wall Street. Everything wrong with American life can be charged up, in his telling, to a small neighborhood in lower Manhattan. Something old-fashioned there is about blaming Wall Street for all the country's deficiencies. But, then, lunatics of one idea, basking in the pleasure of Manichaeism, like to focus all their enmity on one target.For the old American Communist Party this enemy was ""the bosses."" But a street with a symbolic name is even better. Wall Street was viewed as villainous long before Mr. Sanders. For a span it was replaced by Madison Avenue, understood as a hive of hucksters inflaming our desires for things we didn't need. Bernie Sanders has now brought back Wall Street, with as he claims its big-money ability to rig elections and hence destroy all possibility of the good society that socialism, left to its own inner devices, would surely achieve. One idea, and one idea only; it isn't that complicated.Lunatics of one idea have been immensely influential, though it is far from certain that this influence has been beneficial. Think of Karl Marx, whose one idea -- not so far removed from Mr. Sanders's -- was the class struggle. This is an idea that ended in the formation of the Soviet Union and seven decades of pointless suppression, suffering and murder on a scale never before known.Think of Sigmund Freud, whose one idea was that sex is at the absolute center of human existence, eclipsing all else in its importance for the development of human character. This is an idea that has skewed thinking about human nature for more than a century, and, even though Freud's thought is now no longer assigned intellectual respectability, the hangover from it continues nonetheless to influence Western culture. One idea -- that's all that it takes.Being a one-idea lunatic makes life a lot simpler. For one thing, it permits one to eliminate any interfering complexity from the intrusion of other or contradictory ideas, not to mention common sense. The one idea -- class struggle, sexual determinism, evil Wall Street, vile Madison Avenue -- becomes talismanic. Merely utter the words in which the idea is encased and all becomes plain: inner meaning, outward significance, morality, plan of action. That the one idea may not comport with reality is beside the point. As the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset said, create a concept and reality leaves the room. But let that pass.More interesting than Bernie Sanders's threadbare idea is how it has caught on with the young. In generous readings, is it their idealism that puts the young on his side? Is it his relentless moralizing that attracts them? Mr. Sanders is, as they say in social psychology, a contrast gainer -- next to Hillary Clinton, with all her cumbersome political baggage (all of it Louis Vuitton, of course), he looks good. Yet when he utters his mantra at large gatherings, ""Are you ready for a political revolution?"" one wonders: Does this generation that has grown up with a greater sense of entitlement and protection than any other in history really want the revolution Mr. Sanders is selling? Can they have so little sense of the past not to know that the promise of socialism -- ""democratic socialism,"" the senator would interject here -- has ended up in gulags and brutal cultural upheaval?Perhaps the appeal of Bernie Sanders for the young goes no further than the simplicity of his one idea. The nice thing about being a one-idea man or woman is that through it one can dismiss the complications of politics as a business of deals, compromises, limited expectations and partial gains. Why bog down in the grubby details of political life, when you can ride a single idea all the way home to utopia. As Bernie himself says, the middle class has for too long supported Wall Street; now it's time for Wall Street to support the middle class. If you believe that, or believe that it is going to happen, you qualify, prima facie, as a one-idea lunatic of your own. May you live and be well, as the Jews used to say about the czar, but not too close to me.---Mr. Epstein's books include ""Masters of the Games: Essays and Stories on Sport"" (Rowman & Littlefield, 2015).(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Bernie Sanders's Campaign And One Big Idea, or Not"" -- WSJ February 27, 2016)Credit: By Joseph Epstein",4/21/16
"Bernie Sanders's Legacy; After 87 months of Obama, why are young liberals asking for 'change'?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782322851?accountid=12768,"With Hillary Clinton and the party machinery back on track to a now-tarnished coronation, it's worth assessing what Bernie Sanders's campaign accomplished. I still can't take the Vermont Socialist himself seriously, not with Larry David as his doppelgänger. But the Sanders phenomenon--embraced by a strong majority of liberals between the ages of 17 and 50--deserves attention.Reporters have exhaustively plumbed the habitats and mental states of ""the Trump voter."" Sen. Sanders's supporters, by contrast, have floated through the primaries in a mist of keywords--millennials, college students, young professionals, actresses, ""white people.""One has to ask: Are they all actually socialists? I doubt it.It's no surprise Donald Trump in his New York victory speech about the ""corrupt"" Republican Party called Sen. Sanders a fellow ""outsider."" The two great disrupters are remarkably similar, a kind of Tweedledon and Tweedleburn on trade and a ""system"" that's ""broken"" and ""failing"" their supporters.If one word attaches to the Sanders camp, it is ""change."" But change what?This isn't meant to deride their desire for change, which is undoubtedly authentic, but only to ask how it's possible that so many under-50 liberals have settled on Bernie Sanders as a change agent after living daily through more than 87 straight months of a Democratic president elected on a platform of ""Hope and Change""?As to Mrs. Clinton, President Obama's presumed heir, The Wall Street Journal poll this week finds ""just 22% of registered voters give her high marks for being able to bring real change to the country.""What, exactly, is Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or even Bernie Sanders supposed to deliver that an infinity of politicians and public officials before them haven't already delivered?If change has any concrete meaning for Sen. Sanders's supporters, it must have something to do with what the government or public sector does.However imperfect, the federal budget embodies what the U.S. government is.First the numbers. The 2015 federal budget spent about $3.8 trillion, or 21% of the U.S. economy. Year in and year out, that $3 trillion to $4 trillion underwrites programs.As listed at federalsafetynet.com, the programs delivering welfare include: the negative income tax, SNAP (supplemental nutrition), housing assistance, SSI, Pell Grants, TANF (temporary assistance for needy families), child nutrition, Head Start, job training programs, WIC (food for women and children), child care and Liheap (energy subsidies).Entitlement programs include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and the Affordable Care Act.Education: A website called CollegeScholarships.org lists ""Grants from the U.S. Government: Free Money from Uncle Sam.""Why are 25-year-old liberals crying out for ""change,"" if you are spending $4 trillion every year on all this stuff? There's hardly anything significant left to deliver, other than results, so maybe something is wrong with the delivery system.Let's get local. Anyone want to guess what this year's budget is for New York City's hapless school system? It is $27.6 billion.Writing in the Los Angeles Daily News a few years ago, Tim Rutten tried to discern a total-spending figure for the Los Angeles Unified School District. Answer: No one knows. It's too big and too complicated: ""In all, LAUSD receives money earmarked to aid more than 140 categories of students.""This week, the New York Times described the split over Bill and Hillary Clinton between older blacks, who support them, and younger blacks who don't. Said one new-generation activist from Philadelphia: ""We do not believe that freedom for black Americans will come through politicians.""The War on Poverty began in 1965. A half-century later, after uncountable trillions spent, you've still got Baltimore, Chicago, East Brooklyn and East St. Louis. Who wouldn't be angry about black lives?A $15 minimum wage isn't change. It's a fly on the elephant's back.That sound welling out of Sanders rallies is, in no small part, a cri de coeur for accountability. Bernie, a skilled pol, reprogrammed the anger against ""corporate greed,"" but at least you can show up at a shareholders meeting to gripe. With the public sector, it is impossible to identify who they are, other than ""Washington.""At least some of Sen. Sanders's agitated supporters may be starting to recognize that after all these years, the federal government has achieved a steady state of sludge. Hillary Clinton sounds like the most knowledgeable technocrat in America, and none of these young people want much of anything to do with her.Sen. Sanders said he was leading a political revolution. But he won't be its vessel, nor will Mrs. Clinton. It will take someone who can recognize that social change isn't going to happen until you disaggregate these public blobs. And in the private sector, let young companies have enough capital to breathe.Anyone inside Bernie Sanders's neo-socialist orbit suggesting that less blob and more capital might work better runs the risk of being called a ""conservative.""So figure out how to rebrand conservatism, liberalism, progressivism and even socialism as something more like them. Maybe they could call it artisanalism.Write to henninger@wsj.comCredit: By Daniel Henninger",4/22/16
Election 2016: Democrats Vie for Nevada's Minorities --- Clinton and Sanders seek to mobilize nonwhite voters as caucuses near,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765761463?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS -- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will face his biggest test so far in his run for the White House this week, when voters in one of the most ethnically and racially diverse states will make their choice in the Democratic presidential conteston Saturday.Nevada -- a sprawling Western state with important blocs of Latino, black and Asian-American voters -- is the next stop for Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton. For Mr. Sanders, a win in the Silver State would be an opportunity to show he has appeal among the nonwhite voters who make up a significant part of the Democratic electorate. He has long trailed Mrs. Clinton in the polls among black and Hispanic voters. For Mrs. Clinton, a win here would be an important show of force and bolster her argument that she can put together a winning coalition against a Republican nominee.""We're going to get a good sense of what Latinos, African-Americans, and Asians are thinking. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are working tirelessly to reach out to these communities,"" said Ruben Kihuen, a Nevada state senator running for U.S. Congress and a supporter of Mrs. Clinton.The state is more than a quarter Latino and has a sizable black population. It also has a large Asian-American community, the fastest-growing minority group in the country. Non-Hispanic whites now represent less than half of the population of Las Vegas.The state's diversity and the increasingly close battle between the two Democratic candidates have set off a fierce fight to persuade and mobilize nonwhite voters. Two Nevada polls this month show the contest in a dead heat, though the state is traditionally difficult to survey effectively.Mrs. Clinton's campaign brought in Rep. John Lewis, a civil-rights icon and a longtime Democratic member of Congress from Georgia to help boost turnout among the black community. He made his case for Mrs. Clinton at several campaign stops this week, including at a historically black church and a community center in a low-income neighborhood. ""I'm going to continue to travel as long as there's a campaign,"" said Mr. Lewis, calling Mrs. Clinton the best-prepared candidate to be president.The campaign also has brought in Dolores Huerta, a civil-rights leader and labor activist who co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with Cesar Chavez in the 1960s. The campaign is on television in Spanish and has hosted events in Spanish aimed at familiarizing Latino voters with the caucus process.Mr. Sanders's campaign has been equally aggressive, particularly in the Latino community. The campaign brought Mr. Chavez's nephew, Federico Chavez as a surrogate. The campaign is dispatching a group of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children to knock on doors across the state. The campaign is on television with an endorsement from Lucy Flores, a former state legislator running for U.S. Congress.Both candidates attended church services Sunday at a large historically black church in Las Vegas and addressed the congregation.""I am not a single-issue candidate and this is not a single-issue country,"" Mrs. Clinton said, referring to Mr. Sanders's sharp focus on Wall Street and campaign-finance issues. ""Because if we were going to achieve everything about banks and money and politics, would that end racism?""Sanders campaign state director Joan Kato said they are ceding no ground. ""We're doing outreach in all those communities,"" she said.Mrs. Clinton's campaign strategy relies on maintaining her well of support with nonwhite voters after her narrow win in Iowa and big loss in New Hampshire. Both of those states are whiter and more rural than the country at large.Still, her campaign began lowering expectations ahead of the caucuses here. ""There's an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucus in Nevada. But it's still a state that is 80% white voters,"" campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on MSNBC after New Hampshire.The comment drew a rebuke from Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. Mr. Reid told reporters on Tuesday that he had complained to the Clinton campaign about the comment. Mrs. Clinton later rejected the comment in a television interview.Steven Horsford, a Democrat who was the first black Congressman from Nevada and former majority leader of the state senate, said the explicit racial appeals may not work among younger nonwhite voters who are looking for a more comprehensive agenda. Mr. Horsford, now a Washington, D.C., marketing consultant, was voted out of office amid a Republican wave in Nevada in 2014.""Both campaigns have more work to do to speak to a broad constituency and not put everybody in categories -- all African-American voters are not the same,"" said Mr. Horsford, who hasn't endorsed a candidate.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Byron Tau and Alexandra Berzon",4/22/16
"Rigged: A Word Moves From Shipping to Politics; When Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders say the system is 'rigged,' their usage derives from a venerable shipping term",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783557284?accountid=12768,"If one thing unites the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it is their critique that ""the system""--whether political or economic--is ""rigged"" by the powers that be.In stump speeches, Mr. Trump has taken on the Republican Party's national apparatus by claiming that the process for selecting delegates for the presidential nominating convention is ""rigged."" He further stated in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that ""our unfair trade, immigration and economic policies...have also been rigged against Americans.""On the Democratic side, many supporters of Mr. Sanders see the selection of superdelegates by party leaders as ""rigging"" the nomination process in favor of Hillary Clinton. Mr. Sanders also complains about an economic system that is ""rigged"" against the middle class, and Mrs. Clinton has followed suit, acknowledging in a February debate that ""yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.""Where did all of this ""rig""-marole come from? Back in the 16th century, writers chiefly used ""rigged"" to describe sailing vessels fully equipped to go to sea. ""Rigging"" a ship involved fitting it with all the necessary ropes and cables to support the masts and control the sails.""Rigged"" eventually took on a less positive meaning: put together hastily or as a temporary measure. That slapdash sense came through especially in the forms ""rigged up"" or ""jury-rigged."" (""Jury"" originally referred to a ship's temporary ""jury mast,"" erected to replace one that had broken off. Confusion with the expression ""jerry-built"" led to a blended version, ""jerry-rigged."")Meanwhile, an even less flattering meaning of ""rigged"" emerged, having to do with fraudulent manipulation. That usage likely stems from a slangy use of the word ""rig"" meaning ""trick, swindle,"" dated by the Oxford English Dictionary to 1640 and etymologically unrelated to the nautical meaning.Stock markets were the first systems to be called unfairly ""rigged."" An 1826 article in the Times of London described efforts to ""rig"" joint-stock companies by manipulating their prices. The Egyptian Trading Co. was dubbed ""one of the very best 'rigged' Companies that ever were introduced into the share-market.""From the financial world, the word spread to other kinds of corrupt practices. By the early 20th century, ""rigged"" could be used in sports for match-fixing and in politics for election-fixing. ""Vote-rigging"" became a popular label for electoral fraud.Party conventions, too, have often been painted as ""rigged"" long before Messrs. Trump and Sanders. Perhaps most famously, former president Harry Truman resigned as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1960 because he claimed the proceedings were rigged to hand the nomination to John F. Kennedy.After Truman held a press conference warning that the convention looked like ""a prearranged affair,"" Democratic National Chairman Paul M. Butler responded that the nomination would be ""free, open, unrigged and, I hope, unbossed."" We can expect the 2016 conventions to face just as much scrutiny about whether they are rigged or unrigged.Credit: By Ben Zimmer",4/23/16
"Democrats Avoid Jabs at Each Other, Keep Focus on Policy; Ahead of contests Tuesday, Bernie Sanders adopts more conciliatory tone; Hillary Clinton targets GOP's Donald Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783827151?accountid=12768,"PROVIDENCE, R.I.--Facing a tough series of contests this week, Bernie Sanders gave a fresh signal that he is ready to scale down his attacks on rival Hillary Clinton, dropping his argument that she is beholden to Wall Street banks by dint of large speaking fees she has gotten over the years.Mr. Sanders said he still believes he can win the nomination, but he conceded the path is difficult. The Vermont senator trails Mrs. Clinton by 275 pledged convention delegates, and the five states that vote Tuesday could leave him deeper in the hole. The biggest prize is Pennsylvania, with 189 delegates at stake. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll showed Mrs. Clinton 15 percentage points ahead of Mr. Sanders in Pennsylvania, a state where she has been showcasing her family ties.Asked on CNN if he still has a viable path to the nomination, Mr. Sanders said: ""Well, I'm not going to tell you that it's easy, but I think we do.""Mrs. Clinton and her husband, perhaps with an eye toward unifying the party once the nomination fight ends, largely avoided swipes at Mr. Sanders in advance of Tuesday's contests.Apart from Pennsylvania, voters will cast ballots in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Rhode Island. The terrain seems to favor Mrs. Clinton. She does best among minorities; in the 2008 Democratic primary, the Maryland electorate was more than one-third African-American.A poll released Sunday by Brown University's Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy found that among likely voters in Rhode Island's primary, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders 43% to 34%.Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton kept a tight focus on policy goals and stressed her local roots. Appearing in Scranton recently, she noted that she learned how to shoot a gun behind the cottage her grandfather built on Lake Winola in northeast Pennsylvania.Bill Clinton, in a speech over the weekend in the Philadelphia suburbs, took only the mildest jab at Mr. Sanders. The former president said he, too, has been talking about the issue of income inequality--and doing so with greater frequency.""I have a lot of respect for Sen. Sanders and what he's done and continually talking about income inequality,"" Mr. Clinton said at a middle school in Ambler, Pa. ""I believe I've given more speeches on it than anybody in the last 15 years and I never got half the attention he does.""As he has struggled to cut into Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead, Mr. Sanders has faced pressure from prominent Democrats to avoid the sorts of attacks that Republicans could use as a cudgel in a general election.He has largely ignored the advice. In what some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters view as a character attack, Mr. Sanders has called on the former senator and secretary of state to release the transcripts of paid speeches to Wall Street firms. His tone has been sarcastic, noting if she was commanding a speaking fee of $225,000 the prose must have been particularly eloquent, giving her every incentive to make the speeches public.But at a rally in Providence on Sunday, Mr. Sanders dropped the paid speeches riff and stuck to policy differences.Noting his call for a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health system, he said, for example: ""What Hillary Clinton thinks and what the establishment thinks, is that we don't have the guts to take on the private insurance companies and the drug companies.""He added, ""Well, they're wrong.""Looking beyond the Democratic race, he reserved much of his fire for Republicans and GOP front-runner Donald Trump.""I know there is some consternation and worry about Donald Trump becoming president of the United States,"" he said. ""Don't worry, it ain't gonna happen.""He predicted that the ""American public will not elect a president who virtually every day is insulting"" different groups of Americans.Mr. Sanders kept up the conciliatory tone in a series of appearances on the Sunday morning news shows.Asked on ABC's ""This Week"" whether he would become an enthusiastic supporter of Mrs. Clinton if she wins the nomination, the Vermont senator said: ""You know, I can't snap my finger and tell people what to do. But what I will do is do everything that I can to make sure that somebody like a Donald Trump, or some other right-wing Republican, does not become president of the United States.""Mr. Sanders has no plans to drop out of the race. Having built a large, enthusiastic following, Mr. Sanders would disappoint supporters in states that have yet to vote if he were to drop out now, his advisers say.Many people at the outdoor rally in Providence on Sunday were adamant that Mr. Sanders should keep battling.""The math with delegates doesn't look good, I'll admit it,"" said Nancy Smith, 62, a high school English teacher from West Greenwich, R.I. But given Mr. Sanders's popularity, the race ""should play out,"" she said.""It's just frustrating because it seems like people aren't being heard,"" said Ms. Smith.With the nomination within reach, Mrs. Clinton seems to be turning her attention more to the Republican field, particularly front-runner Donald Trump.Mrs. Clinton gave a speech Saturday in Rhode Island in which she mentioned Mr. Trump's name seven times; Mr. Sanders's name, zero.Anticipating that Mr. Trump will try to moderate his rhetoric, the Clinton campaign released a Web video Saturday that cautions voters not to buy into his ""extreme makeover.""The 95-second video includes snippets of Trump speeches that critics have seen as polarizing and incendiary, including his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. It also shows footage of a man sucker-punching a protester at a Trump rally.A message on the screen reads: ""Donald Trump wants you to forget everything he's said. Don't.""Mr. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., on Sunday praised his father's stance on some of those same issues that drew attacks from Democrats, including immigration. The younger Mr. Trump called his father ""the most un-P.C. candidate running for office right now"" and suggested that that quality would help him win the popular vote in November.Kate O'Keeffe contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Jennifer Levitz",4/25/16
"Trump, Clinton Power Ahead --- Democrat's Big Night Widens Her Imposing Lead Over Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382400?accountid=12768,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton won critical presidential primaries in the industrial Midwest and completed her sweep of the South on Tuesday, as she took full command of a contest that has been far more competitive than expected at the start.Rival Bernie Sanders was still hoping to win a close contest in Missouri, but that seemed nowhere near enough to change the dynamic of the race. Mrs. Clinton won in Ohio, Illinois, Florida and North Carolina, and blunted Mr. Sanders's momentum from a win last week in Michigan. She widened her already formidable delegate lead and made it improbable he can catch up.""We are moving close to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November,"" the former secretary of state and New York senator told cheering supporters in Florida, boasting that she has won more votes than any candidate in either party.She took a swipe at Mr. Sanders, saying he should be more specific about his plans, but she lodged a wholesale indictment of Republican front-runner Donald Trump. ""When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture -- that doesn't make him strong. It makes him wrong,"" she said.With 214 pledged delegates at stake, Florida was the night's biggest prize, while Illinois had 156 pledged delegates and Ohio 143 up for grabs. They will be awarded proportionally.Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders was ramping up his attacks on Mrs. Clinton, and has vowed to fight all the way to the summer convention. But he may now face increasing pressure to back off and revert to his earlier role as a candidate primarily driving a progressive, populist message rather than pursuing a viable path to the nomination.At his election night rally in Arizona Tuesday night, though, Mr. Sanders showed no signs of backing off. He pointed to Wall Street contributions to the super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton and repeated his call that she release transcripts of her high-priced speeches to Wall Street firms.""To my mind, if you're going to give a speech for $225,000 it must be a really great speech,"" he said. ""And if it's such a great speech, all of America should be able to read it.""With nearly all precincts counted, Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Sanders by 64.5% to 33% in Florida, by 54.5% to 41% in North Carolina and by 56.5% to 42.7% in Ohio.In Illinois, her margin was much closer, some 50.5% to 48.7% with 94% of precincts reporting.Mrs. Clinton had been expected to easily win Florida, with the state's demographics and rules barring independents from participating helping her. But Ohio was closely fought, and Mr. Sanders had hoped to parlay a victory last week in Michigan to the neighboring state. Both have seen a drain in manufacturing jobs, and Mr. Sanders put the blame squarely on free-trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton has long supported.Mrs. Clinton completed a sweep of the South, where strong support from African-Americans pumped up her totals. But her Ohio win was more important, showing she could win in the industrial Midwest.After Tuesday's vote, Mrs. Clinton was assured of adding at least 253 delegates to her column, bringing her total pledged delegates, who are chosen by the voters, to more than 1,000. Mr. Sanders was sure to add at least 124 delegates, but he was on track to end the night more than 300 delegates behind. Including superdelegates, who can vote for any candidate they like, her total topped 1,400, more than double his.At roughly the halfway point of the race, Sanders advisers say they now have the advantage. His campaign now looks ahead to contests next week in Arizona, Utah and Idaho, three states where aides have hoped to do well. But the next big delegate hauls aren't awarded until April: first in Wisconsin, and then the giant prize of New York, where Mrs. Clinton lives and which she represented in the Senate for eight years.In Florida, Mrs. Clinton's advantage was on display Tuesday in Miami, home to large populations of Hispanic and African-American voters who have gravitated to her campaign.""I like that she's a smart, charismatic woman,"" said Bridgette Thornton, a 37-year-old African-American attorney, who cast her ballot at a Miami church. ""It was a difficult choice for me, but I'm a practical person. Hillary has a better shot at winning the presidential election.""The race was closer in Ohio, where Mr. Sanders hammered his anti-free-trade views in recent days. Mrs. Clinton tried to recast her trade message, but the attempt fell flat with at least some voters.""The Clinton history with trade policies, that really just killed our area,"" said Fred Woke, a 57-year-old radio announcer who voted for Mr. Sanders in Niles.The challenge for both Democrats is that Mr. Trump, should he win the Republican nomination, would be an unconventional opponent who could pick up some of Mr. Sanders's populist arguments.That has some Clinton backers anxious for Mr. Sanders to ease up. ""The message of Sanders campaign has become personal attacks,"" said Robert Zimmerman, a superdelegate from New York who backs Mrs. Clinton. ""It's not only wrong, it's dangerous politically if he keeps up that tone.""Steve Elmendorf, a consultant who backs Mrs. Clinton, agreed there will come a point when Mr. Sanders needs to let up, but he said it isn't for Clinton supporters to say when. ""When it becomes clear you cannot win, then you should unite behind the nominee of the party and try to beat the Republicans,"" Mr. Elmendorf said. ""It's for him to decide when he can't win.""In 2008, Mrs. Clinton continued to compete in presidential-primary contests against then-Sen. Barack Obama even though he remained ahead in the delegate race the entire time.""Even if he doesn't think he will win the nomination, he's trying to amass as many delegates as he can,"" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. Delegates would give Mr. Sanders leverage at the party's convention and demonstrate the strength of his movement, Mr. Trippi said, adding, ""I don't see him relenting.""Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant in Florida who voted for Mrs. Clinton, said he doesn't worry that the Sanders attacks will damage her, partly because Democrats are sure to unify if Mr. Trump is the nominee. ""You want to get Democrats over the Sanders-Clinton thing, give them five seconds to think about Trump being within five feet of the nuclear codes,"" Mr. Schale said.---Arian Campo-Flores and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.(See related article: ""GOP Front-Runner Knocks Out Rubio, but Kasich Hangs Onto Ohio"" -- WSJ March 16, 2016)Credit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",4/25/16
Election 2016: Sanders's Math Gets Even More Daunting,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382266?accountid=12768,"Notching wins in at least four big contests Tuesday, Hillary Clinton is on track to become the Democratic presidential nominee, with a delegate lead large enough to withstand whatever challenge rival Bernie Sanders mounts before the voting wraps up in June.Mrs. Clinton captured the biggest prize of the night, winning Florida by more than 30 percentage points. She also easily won North Carolina and Ohio and edged her rival in Illinois. Under party rules that award delegates proportionally based on results, Mrs. Clinton expanded her lead as the race reached the halfway point in terms of delegates.Mrs. Clinton had already built an advantage that looked insurmountable barring a collapse of her candidacy, delegate experts said. She led Mr. Sanders 768 to 554 in pledged delegates, coming off the 29 separate contests that preceded Tuesday's elections. Throw in the superdelegates -- Democratic leaders and elected officials who are free to back whomever they choose -- and her lead stood at 1,235 to 580.With Tuesday's partial results, Mrs. Clinton added at least 253 pledged delegates to her tally, while Mr. Sanders added 124 delegates. A total of 2,383 delegates overall are needed to clinch the nomination.""It would take something not really seen in modern politics"" for Mr. Sanders to overtake her, said David Wasserman, a delegate analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. An analysis by Mr. Wasserman shows that the Vermont senator, in advance of the voting on Tuesday, needed to win 61% of the remaining delegates and superdelegates who are as yet uncommitted to catch up to Mrs. Clinton.A hopeful sign for Mr. Sanders is that Mrs. Clinton isn't doing as well as she did in the 2008 campaign among white male voters. But she is winning solidly among minorities, who figure to carry great weight in those states.""She's following exactly the strategy the campaign had,"" said Tom Nides, a Clinton fundraiser and a top deputy to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department. ""They wanted by March 15 to be mathematically in position to guarantee the nomination and I think we're moving very quickly to that position.""---Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/25/16
Election 2016: Sanders Tested in Must-Win State --- Massachusetts vote is key to countering wins that Clinton is seen racking up in the South,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768850008?accountid=12768,"BOSTON -- Hillary and Bill Clinton crisscrossed Massachusettson Monday, and Sen. Bernie Sanders made one last pitch in the state, in a set of appearances that showed the practical and symbolic importance of the voting here on Super Tuesday.Mr. Sanders needs a win in Massachusetts to dent Mrs. Clinton's momentum and counterbalance the victories she is expected to secure in the South. In contesting a state that borders Mr. Sanders's home state of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton is trying to deny her rival a liberal beachhead and to build on her growing delegate lead.""If she wins by even a little, I think she can claim to really shut Bernie Sanders down,"" said Scott Ferson, a Democratic strategist in Boston who isn't working for either campaign. The question, he said, would become: ""If Bernie can't win in Massachusetts, where does he win?""Clinton campaign officials have said the state's demographics, liberal profile and proximity to Vermont play to Mr. Sanders's strengths. Polls show Mrs. Clinton with a single-digit lead. But Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton's communications director, said the state presents a challenge for the former senator and secretary of state.The ""optics of who wins Massachusetts is very important,"" said Democratic state Sen. Dan Wolf, a Sanders backer and founder and chief executive of regional airline Cape Air. ""People are watching to see what Massachusetts does, and therefore we will be center stage tomorrow.""Mrs. Clinton and her husband have longtime ties to the state, and she notched a double-digit win over then-Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 Massachusetts presidential primary. This year, she has made an aggressive play for the state during the final sprint to voting.She held rallies in Springfield and Boston on Monday, and Mr. Clinton planned to appear at a late-night get-out-the-vote event in Worcester. The Clinton campaign dispatched an all-star team of political officeholders to knock on doors over the weekend.""I need your help,"" Mrs. Clinton told supporters in Springfield. ""I will work as hard as I can. Every single day, I will get up and go to work for you and fight for you.""Mr. Sanders has said he still sees a path to the nomination, predicting that he would collect ""a very good share"" of the more than 800 delegates to be awarded on Tuesday. To accomplish that, he would need to win more than Vermont, the only Super Tuesday state where polls show him with a decisive lead.Among the states holding Democratic primaries or caucuses, Massachusetts is one Mr. Sanders has targeted. The Sanders campaign said thousands of volunteers were ""aggressively getting out the vote for Bernie.""And Mr. Sanders, who visited Massachusetts last week, was back on Monday for an evening rally at a high school outside Boston.""Your state led the American Revolution,"" he told several thousand people gathered in Milton High School's gymnasium. ""Now it is time for Massachusetts to lead a political revolution!""Mr. Sanders leveled a few of his familiar attacks on Mrs. Clinton, including for her paid speeches to the financial sector, and portrayed himself as the candidate who would be best able to beat Donald Trump in the general election.While Mrs. Clinton enjoys backing from most elected officials in the state, the Massachusetts Democratic activists who helped elevate Elizabeth Warren to the U.S. senate in 2012 are more divided. Ms. Warren, who sounds the same populist themes as does Mr. Sanders, has stayed neutral.""I think of Bernie as a bigger, better Elizabeth,"" said Tony Badman, 70, a retired data-program manager who lives in Marlborough and is trying to generate support for Mr. Sanders.While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders had hit pause on their quarrel over who is the true progressive in this race, Mrs. Clinton on Monday told voters: ""I am a progressive who likes to make progress.""Garrett Sullivan, 61, a longtime Clinton supporter from Springfield, said she has proposed the right mix of policies, including plans to rein in college debt and bolster struggling cities. He is less familiar with Mr. Sanders, but said, ""I don't support his agenda.""Credit: By Jennifer Levitz and Colleen McCain Nelson",4/25/16
Election 2016: Sanders Slowed by Nevada --- Coming contests will test the Vermont senator's efforts to broaden his coalition,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766945173?accountid=12768,"GREENVILLE, S.C. -- Bernie Sanders faces a narrow path to the Democratic presidential nomination after a defeat in the Nevada caucuses blunted his momentum and highlighted the steep challenge of broadening his coalition.Hillary Clinton won Nevada by 5 percentage points Saturday, but her victory was arguably bigger than that, coming as the Vermont senator was building his case as a credible challenger.The former secretary of state now has claimed victory in two of the first three contests, and is favored to win Saturday's South Carolina primary. Mr. Sanders, who walloped her in the New Hampshire primary, won't see his next best chance for a victory until March 1, when 11 states host primaries and caucuses.Mrs. Clinton's Nevada win settled her nervous backers, just as the race shifts to the South, long considered to be her firewall, primarily because of her strong support from African-American voters. Mr. Sanders spent Sunday in South Carolina, but already appears to be pivoting to the next round of primaries with nearly 900 delegates up for grabs.""We're going to be competing in 11 states all across this country [March 1] on Super Tuesday,"" Mr. Sanders said after conceding Nevada. ""And I believe that on Super Tuesday, we have got an excellent chance to win many of those states.""On Sunday, Mr. Sanders said he isn't skipping over South Carolina, but after holding a rally in Greenville, S.C., Sunday night, the Vermont senator will head to Massachusetts for a rally on Monday and then to Virginia on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton plans to hold events in South Carolina on Tuesday and Wednesday.The March 1 terrain offers Mr. Sanders some opportunities. His campaign is running TV ads in Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma and Massachusetts, states where it sees its best chance for victory. Minnesota and Colorado are caucus states, which tend to attract the more liberal voters that he appeals to, his advisers said. He also holds a huge advantage in his home state of Vermont.But also voting the same day are Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Arkansas, all contests that will feature significant numbers of African-American voters. That should provide an advantage to Mrs. Clinton, whose support in the black community was reaffirmed in Nevada, where entrance polls showed three-fourths of African-Americans backed her. She's expected to see similar support in South Carolina.Sanders aides have said for months that the campaign must expand its support base and find ways to appeal to black voters. On Sunday, he spoke at a black church in Columbia, S.C.But Nevada's results revealed little progress overall. ""We did badly with the African-American vote,"" Mr. Sanders told CNN on Sunday. ""But I think the more the African-American community hears our message. . . I think you're going to see us making progress there as well.""One open question is Mrs. Clinton's advantage with Latino voters, who are a key part of the electorate in places including Texas, anotherMarch 1state. Entrance polls showed Mr. Sanders winning this group, but the Clinton campaign questioned that finding.After Super Tuesday, the Sanders campaign sees potential victories on March 5 in Kansas and Nebraska and on March 6 in Maine -- all three caucus states. Sanders aides are also focused on the big prize of Michigan, where a primary is set for March 8. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver also noted that under Democratic Party rules, delegates are allocated proportionately, meaning that if a race is close, both candidates win substantial delegates.There are no winner-take-all states in the Democratic primary race, which prevents one candidate from pulling far away from a competitor.

""None of us really trust Hillary or understand what her vision would be.""Mrs. Clinton is ahead in the polls here largely because of her support from black voters, a strength that helped propel her to victory in Saturday's Nevada caucuses and one expected to bring her a win in Saturday's primary here.But Mr. Sanders has gained a deep following among black college students, according to more than three dozen interviews across five universities with students, professors, university administrators and longtime political observers.While Mrs. Clinton leads 68% to 21% among black voters, who make up more than 50% of turnout in South Carolina, her lead shrinks to 52% to 35% among black voters under 45, according to the latest WSJ/NBC News poll.Many of the college students interviewed by The Wall Street Journal said they argue with their pro-Clinton parents and grandparents as they embrace Mr. Sanders's calls for free college tuition and more aggressive actions to curb Wall Street excesses.Marcurius Byrd, a first-year law-school student at the University of South Carolina, won his mother over to Mr. Sanders's side but his father is still backing Mrs. Clinton, for now.""Hillary just doesn't inspire the change that is necessary to build on [President Barack] Obama's legacy and really keep us moving forward,"" he said. ""My dad is just getting introduced to Bernie Sanders.""The Clinton name is potent in South Carolina, which delivered a decisive 1992 victory for Mr. Clinton. A Southern Democrat who appealed to blue-collar voters, Mr. Clinton had a long relationship with civil-rights leaders in the state and presided over a period of economic prosperity here that older black voters remember.Many older voters simply say they don't know Mr. Sanders and question his commitment to their communities.Yet when Mr. Clinton returned to the state in 2008, he caught flak for comments that seemed dismissive of Jesse Jackson and Mr. Obama. The Clintons and black lawmakers have moved on from that moment, as the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Mrs. Clinton this month.At the University of South Carolina, many students are kicking the tires of the Clinton legacy and questioning its impact, said Bobby Donaldson, a history and African-American Studies professor. His colleague, Todd Shaw, a black political scientist, said his students are also largely backing Mr. Sanders.Many of their elders don't understand the impulse. Fletcher Smith, a longtime state representative, said he had tried to reason with younger voters. ""The young people didn't have to suffer like we did,"" Mr. Smith said. ""They didn't go through everything we've been through. We've been through a whole lot with the Clintons, and we haven't seen a whole lot from Bernie.""To be sure, many college students are also embracing Mrs. Clinton.Angel Risher wore her Miss Allen University sash and tiara to recent rallies for both the Clinton and Sanders camps. The student at Allen, a private, historically black institution, said she is picking Mrs. Clinton, inspired by Bill Clinton's half-hour synopsis of his wife's accomplishments.Both campaigns are trying to woo black college students in the state, yet it remains uncertain how many of the students are registered to vote -- and how many will actually go to the polls.Credit: By Josh Dawsey and Valerie Bauerlein",4/25/16
Election 2016: Sanders Slices Into Clinton's Lead,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766256774?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders has cut Hillary Clinton's once-commanding national lead in the Democratic presidential race by more than half over the past month, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds.Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, drew support from 53% of people who expect to vote in Democratic primaries, while 42% picked Mr. Sanders. That 11-point spread is much closer than the 25-point advantage Mrs. Clinton enjoyed a month ago, when the poll found her ahead by 59% to 34%.The new poll found that Mrs. Clinton holds a solid but diminished lead among her core group of supporters: women. She continues to dominate among minorities, a crucial voting bloc in coming contests in Nevada and the South.""The race is tightening,"" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who helped conduct the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. At the same time, he said, Mrs. Clinton retains ""structural advantages . . . that put her in a competitive position to be the Democratic nominee.""The poll points to a long-term challenge for Mrs. Clinton in the continued rise of negative feelings about her among the broader electorate. Half of the people surveyed said they felt negatively about her, a record high for her. More than half said they would feel uncertain or pessimistic if she won the White House.Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster who helped conduct the survey, said Mrs. Clinton's biggest obstacle isn't Mr. Sanders, but her own difficulty in winning the trust and affection of voters.""She is running against herself,"" Mr. Hart said. ""When it comes to competence, temperament . . . she laps the field. Voters just need to like her.""The poll, conducted Feb. 14-16, signaled continuing progress for Mr. Sanders in the aftermath of Iowa's caucuses, where Mrs. Clinton barely eked out a victory, and in New Hampshire, where the Vermont senator won decisively.Mr. Sanders's gains over the past month were due in large part to rising support among younger women. Mrs. Clinton remains ahead among women overall, but Mr. Sanders slashed her lead by 19 percentage points, to 58%-39%. Mr. Sanders leads among women under age 50, while Mrs. Clinton holds a far larger lead among those 50 and older.A bigger challenge for Mr. Sanders has been his underperformance among minority voters. He made some gains among nonwhite voters in the new poll, but Mrs. Clinton still leads among those voters by 29 percentage points, 62% to 33%. In January, she had led by 42 points.More Democratic voters express reservations about Mr. Sanders's key weaknesses than about Mrs. Clinton's. About one-quarter said they were concerned about his lack of foreign policy experience, and 23% said his policy proposals were out of the mainstream.Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street -- a central line of attack by Mr. Sanders -- were a concern to 22% of Democratic voters. Questions about Mrs. Clinton's honesty and judgment related to her use of a private email server while in the government seemed of little consequence within the party:Only 7% of Democratic primary voters said they were concerned about it.Mr. Sanders is winning over change-oriented young women such as Laurren Nirider, 25, a poll participant in Richland, Wash.""I'm 100% behind having a woman president. But I'm not going to support someone just because she's a woman,"" said Ms. Nirider, who backs Mr. Sanders. ""Compared to Hillary Clinton, he's going to be able to move the country in a more forward direction. He's rattling the cages a little more.""Nancy D. Pemberton, 65, a college teacher in Tryon, N.C., said she thought Mr. Sanders was too inexperienced and his policies unrealistic. She saw Mrs. Clinton as better equipped for the office. ""She can get the job done, and that is the most compelling thing that I am looking at,"" said Ms. Pemberton, who added, ""It couldn't hurt to have a woman in there.""The poll asked voters of both parties to consider hypothetical matchups and found that Mr. Sanders, at least for now, seemed better equipped than Mrs. Clinton to beat a GOP opponent in the fall.Mr. Sanders outpolled businessman Donald Trump by 16 points -- 53% to 37% -- and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas by 50% to 40%.Mrs. Clinton also beat Mr. Trump in a one-on-one matchup, 50% to 40%, but only tied Mr. Cruz, 46% to 46%.Mr. Hart warned, however, that such polls this early in a campaign are poor predictors of general election matchups when a candidate is as little known as Mr. Sanders.If the election came to a Clinton-Trump face-off, Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Trump, 50% to 40%, among registered voters. But only 34% said their vote would be a sign of support for their chosen candidate, while 47% said it would signal they didn't want the other candidate to be elected.Asked whether they viewed the candidates in a favorable or unfavorable light, voters had sharply negative views of three candidates: Mrs. Clinton and Messrs. Cruz and Trump. Some 59% of voters viewed Mr. Trump negatively.Views of only two candidates -- Mr. Sanders and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- were more positive than negative.None of the candidates in either party inspired great confidence: Asked how they would feel if each were elected president, no candidate prompted more than 21% of voters to say they would feel ""optimistic and confident.""Credit: By Janet Hook",4/25/16
"Hillary Clinton Seeking Votes, Party Unity in Five Northeastern States; Bernie Sanders shows little signs of backing down with Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island up for grabs",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784316087?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is set to shift her top mission from winning more states to persuading supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders to coalesce behind her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination after Tuesday's primaries.So far, the Sanders campaign is showing little sign it is ready to step aside and make it easier for her to capture the prize.Polling shows that Mr. Sanders would have a tough time cutting into Mrs. Clinton's formidable delegate lead after ballots were cast Tuesday in five states: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island. Mrs. Clinton was leading in polls in all those states and had been expected to win easily in several of them.But the yearlong fight has exposed deep fissures between Sanders and Clinton supporters rooted in age, race and ideology, as Mr. Sanders built a passionate following among young, white, liberal voters. Those rifts may be tough to heal.A new poll shows Mr. Sanders is the most popular person in the race in either party among young voters. The Harvard Institute of Politics survey showed that among 18-to-29-year-olds, 54% viewed him positively, 31% negatively.Mrs. Clinton, in contrast, remained the favorite of African-Americans, centrists and older Democrats. In the Harvard poll, only 37% of young voters viewed Mrs. Clinton in a positive light.""We have to be respectful, dignified and begin the process of bringing everyone together,"" said Tom Nides, a top deputy to Mrs. Clinton during her years as secretary of state and now a senior executive at Morgan Stanley. Any effort to push out Mr. Sanders, he said, ""will trigger the opposite.""One question facing Clinton allies is when, or whether, they can become more vocal in their call for Mr. Sanders to focus on party unity. They are hoping more Clinton victories, like those they were anticipating Tuesday night, will prompt growing calls from within the party for Mr. Sanders at least to soften his criticisms of Mrs. Clinton.Related* Northeast Primaries: Live Coverage* What to Watch in Tuesday's Primaries* Sanders Mentions Elizabeth Warren as Possible Running Mate* Pennsylvania Shows Hillary Clinton's New KeystonePolling suggests the party is becoming less unified, not more. In March, 78% of Democratic primary voters said they would be satisfied if Mrs. Clinton were the nominee. In April, that fell to 73%, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. Asked if they could see themselves supporting Mrs. Clinton for president, just 58% of Sanders primary voters said yes, with 40% saying no, according to the April poll.This has led to some uneasiness among party leaders, who fear that scars from the hard-fought campaign could make it hard to unify the party for the general election. As the race reaches the endgame, bitterness is evident from some rank-and-file Sanders voters and the candidates themselves.At a polling place in Providence, R.I., Christine Kolasa, a retired mortgage-banking manager in her 60s, said she had voted for Mr. Sanders and would never vote for Mrs. Clinton in a general election.""There isn't enough money in the world to make me vote for Hillary,"" said Ms. Kolasa. ""She says whatever it takes to get elected.""Cesar Barreto, 51, a Sanders supporter who voted at a Rockville, Md., polling place, said the Vermont senator should ""fight to the very bitter end."" But he said that if it came to a Trump-Clinton match-up, ""given the two evils, I'd probably vote for Hillary.""At a televised MSNBC town hall event on the eve of the vote, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders said in separate appearances that it was the other one's job to unite the party behind Mrs. Clinton if she becomes the nominee.The best way for her to mobilize his supporters, Mr. Sanders said, was for her to adopt pillars of his liberal agenda, including a single-payer health-care system, a carbon tax and free tuition at public colleges. Mrs. Clinton has supported none of these ideas.Were she to pivot now and embrace Mr. Sanders's positions, some of her supporters point out, she would be vulnerable to charges of flip-flopping. Such a switch would also make it tougher to win over moderates and independents in a general-election showdown with Republicans.For her part, Mrs. Clinton bristled at the suggestion that to win over Mr. Sanders and his backers, she needs to adopt his agenda. Recalling her fight with then-Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race, she said, ""We got to the end in June, and I did not put down conditions. I didn't say, 'You know what, if Sen. Obama does X, Y and Z, maybe I'll support him.' ""She added, ""I concluded after it was over in June that Sen. Obama was going to be the nominee and I didn't want to hurt him.""Bickering between the Sanders and Clinton camps unfolded throughout the day on Tuesday.In a CNN interview, Mr. Sanders's wife, Jane Sanders, raised the issue of Mrs. Clinton's refusal to release transcripts of paid speeches she has given to Wall Street firms, while parrying calls for Mr. Sanders to release more of his tax returns.Mrs. Clinton has released tax returns dating back to the 1970s, and during a debate on April 14, Mr. Sanders said he would release past years' returns, citing the campaign's busy schedule as the cause for any delays. But the day after that debate, Mr. Sanders released his full 2014 return, and he hasn't released any since.Mrs. Sanders on Tuesday placed a new condition on the release of tax records covering earlier years. ""What's interesting is we released the 2014, Secretary Clinton hasn't released the transcript yet,"" Mrs. Sanders said. ""Why don't we wait to see what happens?""Asked by CNN if she was linking the release of tax records to Mrs. Clinton's release of speech transcripts, Mrs. Sanders said, ""Yep.""At the same time, a fundraising solicitation from the Sanders campaign used harsh language in describing Clinton campaign tactics. The letter says the Clinton campaign is trying to get Mr. Sanders to tone down his rhetoric and accusing him of aiding Republican front-runner Donald Trump.The email, from Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, said the Clinton campaign, in describing Sanders campaign methods, has ""used language reserved for traitors to our country, saying we are 'giving aid and comfort' to Trump.""While Mr. Sanders's path to winning the nomination is growing increasingly narrow by his own admission, staying in the race and continuing to attract money and support could strengthen his hand as he tries to push the Democratic message in a more progressive direction.Democratic operatives said that whatever the current tensions, the party will unify in the face of a Republican opponent, especially one as polarizing as either of the two leading GOP candidates, Mr. Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.The Democrats' divisions, they added, are nothing compared to the splits in the GOP, with the top candidates calling each other names and threats of a chaotic Republican convention in Cleveland.Should Mrs. Clinton win the nomination, Mr. Sanders will support her over the Republican nominee, his advisers say. The question is how ardent will he be in backing her.Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, a loyal Clinton supporter, recalled getting a phone call from her at the end of the 2008 race telling him she was dropping out and asking him to endorse Mr. Obama. That was a message Mr. Nutter said he heeded.""I asked her, 'What do you want me to do?' "" Mr. Nutter said. ""She said, 'I want you to give him the same support you gave me.' And from that moment on, I was all Sen. Obama all the time.""Richard Rubin, Jennifer Levitz and Byron Tau contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",4/26/16
Election 2016: Sanders Strives for Arizona Comeback,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774717214?accountid=12768,"PHOENIX -- Sen. Bernie Sanders, lagging far behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential race, is looking for a comeback in Arizona, where he has spent the better part of the past week campaigning ahead of Tuesday's primary.Both campaigns are working hard for the state, with rallies, multiple television ads and high-profile surrogates. They have also waged another round in their battle over who has the best record on immigration, an issue of particular concern here.ButMr. Sanders has invested far more personal attention, with events almost every day over the past week, a trip to the U.S.-Mexican border and special attention to the Native American community.""As I look around here, I see a lot of energy, I see a lot of beauty, I see a lot of enthusiasm,"" Mr. Sanders told more than 3,000 people at a weekend rally.""And I see a lot of people who are going to transform the United States.""Tuesdaywill also feature Democratic caucuses in Idaho and Utah, and both camps say Mr. Sanders has the advantage in those two states.After last week's sweep of five big-state primaries, top Clinton aides have argued that her delegate lead is so significant that it is now almost impossible for Mr. Sanders to catch up.Limited public polling suggests Mrs. Clinton is ahead in Arizona. She is helped by rules that limit participation in the party primary to Democrats, given Mr. Sanders's appeal to independent voters. The state's demographics may also help: Older voters are among her strongest supporters, and in 2008, nearly four in 10 voters were age 60 and over.Mr. Sanders has performed best with white voters, who in 2008 made up 68% of Arizona's Democratic primary. The nonwhite population in Arizona is smaller than in Southern states where Mrs. Clinton dominated, but still higher than most states where Mr. Sanders has scored wins.The Vermont senator has built his Arizona campaign around appeals to both Hispanics and Native Americans.Over the weekend, he helda news conference along the Mexican border in Nogales, where he criticized the idea of a border fence and slammed the federal government's deportation policies. ""We don't need a wall, and we don't need barbed wire,"" he said.On the airwaves, Mrs. Clinton is highlighting issues including immigration and gun control. One spot features a young girl fearful that her parents will be deported, with Mrs. Clinton emotionally promising to do the worrying for her. A second ad has former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was wounded by a gunshot to her head during a constituent event in 2011, saying Mrs. Clinton will ""stand up to the gun lobby.""The state's early voting program tends to favor the front-runners, and as of Monday, about 300,000 ballots had been cast in the Democratic primary. That compares with about 455,000 total votes in the 2008 primary.For Mr. Sanders, a victory is critical to maintaining enthusiasm for his campaign in the face of his steep delegate climb. Sanders aides argue he can win the nomination if he scores big wins in New York in April and California in June. That is a tough order.Meantime, a win here is important for the Clinton campaign to blunt any momentum Mr. Sanders might get if he wins a string of caucuses, including Idaho and Utah on Tuesday,and Alaska, Hawaii and Washington next week.Credit: By Laura Meckler and Byron Tau",4/26/16
The Zero-Sum Worlds of Trump and Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774469619?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders might seem unlikely economic soul mates, but they share a mistaken reliance on zero-sum thinking and long-discredited economic policies.Mr. Trump's anti-immigration and anti-trade positions make him essentially a disciple of mercantilism -- a protectionist economic theory refuted by Adam Smith in 1776. Bernie Sanders proudly calls himself a socialist and advocates vast increases in taxes and government power. The history of the past century, from the Soviet Union's fall to the impending collapse of Venezuela, amply shows that a socialist economy isn't only ""rigged"" -- to borrow one of Mr. Sanders's favorite words -- it doesn't work.Messrs. Trump and Sanders have been led astray by zero-sum thinking, or the assumption that economic magnitudes are fixed when they are in fact variable.If the world is zero-sum, then the number of jobs is fixed, as is gross domestic product. In Mr. Trump's mind, if there are more Mexican workers in the U.S., then American workers must lose their jobs. In the real, positive-sum world where Mr. Trump doesn't live, Mexican workers also consume, thus increasing GDP and creating new jobs.Moreover, the reason that firms hire immigrant workers is to lower costs, and this leads to lower prices for consumers, allowing them to purchase additional goods -- adding new jobs to the U.S. economy. But in a fixed world prices do not change, so this effect is ignored.Similar arguments apply to Mr. Trump's analysis of Chinese imports. In a world of fixed GDP and prices, imports of goods from China merely replace goods that otherwise would have been produced by American workers. In the real world, imports reduce prices and increase GDP, so workers, who are also consumers, benefit from imports of lower-cost goods and increase their consumption of other goods.Mr. Sanders's economics is also zero-sum, although he emphasizes a different aspect of the fallacy. In a zero-sum world, taxes don't matter much because people work the same amount anyway, so there are no losses from reduced effort in response to higher taxes. Similarly, in a zero-sum world methods of production are given, so there are no responses to changing prices -- higher minimum wages don't lead to layoffs, for example. (In the real world, we saw Wal-Mart's recent store closings following wage increases.) In the Bernie Sanders universe, the size of the economy is fixed so there is plenty to redistribute no matter how misguided the economic policies.Zero-sum thinking persists because it is superficially appealing. Mr. Trump's policies would in theory benefit Americans and increase jobs. Mr. Sanders's policies would make the poor better off. In the actual, positive-sum world we live in, their policies -- building a fence along the Mexican border, disrupting labor markets by deporting millions of productive workers, huge tariffs on imported goods, much higher income taxes and minimum wages -- would, if adopted, lead to an economic depression that would make the 1930s look prosperous.---Mr. Rubin, an economics professor at Emory University and a senior fellow at the Classical Liberal Institute at New York University, is the author of ""Darwinian Politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom"" (Rutgers Press, 2002).(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Candidates' Zero-Sum Worldview Is Wrong"" -- WSJ Mar. 26, 2016)Credit: By Paul H.

Hillary's and Bernie's Pie-in-the-Sky Social Security Proposals,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774104006?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have squared off in what progressive author James W. Russell recently called ""the Democratic Party's increasingly central debate over expansion of Social Security."" Challenged by Mr. Sanders to join him in promising ""never to cut Social Security,"" Mrs. Clinton tweeted a response: ""I won't cut Social Security. As always, I'll defend it, & I'll expand it. Enough false innuendos."" Nevertheless, the reforms they propose would change the program in fundamental but different ways.Both candidates want massive tax increases, but not by increasing the payroll tax rate, the traditional means for buttressing Social Security finances. Instead, they would put all the financial burden on high-income earners. Mr. Sanders would eliminate, over 17 years, the $118,500 ceiling on which payroll taxes are levied. He also would immediately apply a 6.2% tax on investment income to households with incomes above $250,000. Mrs. Clinton is more circumspect but has recently spoken in favor of both approaches.The maximum earnings subject to the payroll tax would be raised, but -- and this is significant -- without increasing the benefits eventually paid out to those who pay more in. Moreover, for the first time, non-wage income would be taxed.What sets Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders apart is how they increase benefits. Mrs. Clinton would raise retirement payments for widows as well as provide Social Security credits for individuals who take time out of the workforce to care for a child or an infirm adult. Mr. Sanders would increase the basic benefit for most retirees, raise cost-of-living adjustments, and institute a new minimum benefit for long-career low earners. Overall, Mr. Sanders's proposed benefit increases are nearly three times as large as Mrs. Clinton's.But Mrs. Clinton's benefit increases are more ""progressive."" I analyzed both proposals using the Policy Simulation Group's microsimulation models, which are used by the Social Security Administration, Government Accountability Office and Labor Department. Under Mrs. Clinton's plan, about 57% of the total dollar increase in benefits would flow to the bottom two-fifths of households, with 21% received by the top two quintiles of households. Under Mr. Sanders's plan, 35% of total benefit increases flow to the bottom two-fifths of households while 44% go to the top two-fifths.These differences derive from the not-entirely-progressive provisions of Mr. Sanders's benefit increases. For instance, Social Security currently replaces 90% of an individual's first $10,272 in average pre-retirement earnings, with lower replacement rates for earnings above that level. Mr. Sanders raises the annual earnings covered by that 90% replacement rate to about $11,800. This boosts benefits progressively for individuals with earnings above $10,272, but individuals with earnings below $10,272 receive no benefit increase. Mr. Sanders also institutes a minimum benefit of 125% of the poverty threshold for workers with 30 years of earnings, but those with shorter careers -- who are usually poorer -- receive less. Higher cost-of-living adjustments also tend to benefit wealthier, longer-lived retirees.Despite increased taxes, neither proposal would shore up Social Security's long-term funding deficits. These currently range from $10 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 75 years, according to various government estimates.The Sanders plan, according to Social Security Administration actuaries, would close about 82% of the program's long-term deficit as scored by the Social Security's Trustees. But it would fix only about half of the larger shortfall as projected by the Congressional Budget Office.Mrs. Clinton's more restrained benefit increases would probably let her approach 75-year solvency under the assumptions made by the Social Security Trustees, but still fall well short of addressing larger projected shortfalls estimated by the CBO, or by a recent Technical Panel appointed by the bipartisan Social Security Advisory Board. In any event, both presidential contenders would raise the effective top marginal tax rate by 12 percentage points.SSA actuaries assume that upper-income individuals would not work less in response to higher payroll taxes -- but the SSA and the CBO do assume that if employers must pay 6.2% tax on their employees' earnings above $118,500, they will reduce employee wages to cover the extra costs. Those lost employee earnings would no longer be subject to federal income taxes, state income taxes, or Medicare payroll taxes. In short, while Social Security might gain $2.4 trillion over 10 years, the rest of the budget would lose nearly half a trillion dollars in revenues over that time.It's unclear how popular either proposal would be in the general election. Americans don't want Scandinavian levels of taxation and certainly not, in Mr. Sanders's case, to pay higher benefits to mostly higher-income households.A well-designed but fiscally conservative Social Security reform could compete with either plan. For instance, a flat poverty-level retirement benefit paid to all, coupled with expanded access to 401(k)s, could eliminate poverty in old age, increase retirement saving, and make Social Security solvent at almost one-third lower cost than Mr. Sanders's plan, eliminating the 12.4% payroll tax on retirees who continue to work.---Mr. Biggs is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

Election 2016: Sanders Puts Emphasis on Delegate Math --- Vermont senator's campaign shifts strategy to maximize Democratic delegates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772649481?accountid=12768,"On the eve of a five-state showdown Tuesday Bernie Sanders's campaign has dropped its focus on winning marquee states in favor of scooping up delegates anywhere it can find them, hoping to show he still has a chance of overcoming Hillary Clinton's large lead and capturing the Democratic presidential nomination.Mr. Sanders's shift in strategy is a response to the hard realities of delegate math: Despite an upset victory in Michigan last week that cheered his supporters he is losing ground to Mrs. Clinton and in danger of reaching the point where it is impossible to catch up.Two states where the Sanders campaign concedes he will have a tough time winning Tuesday are Florida and North Carolina. Rather than cede them to Mrs. Clinton and focus on winning a trio of Midwestern states where his prospects are brighter, Mr. Sanders late last week expanded his television advertising in certain Florida and North Carolina markets, his advisers said. The idea is to pluck a few delegates in the face of an expected Clinton victory in both states.""The goal Tuesday is to win as many delegates as we can. And if we can win states, too, that's a big plus,"" said Tad Devine, a Sanders campaign strategist. ""Now we have to build a foundation of delegates. A lot of delegates are in play [on Tuesday]. We can get a lot of them, we think. The advertising in some of these [Florida and North Carolina] markets may make the difference.""That is different than the approach Mr. Sanders has taken in the past. When 11 states were up for grabs on March 1, Mr. Sanders did scant advertising and spent little time in Southern states where his rival was favored. He focused instead on capturing a handful of states -- including Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma -- and demonstrating he could beat Mrs. Clinton outside his home base of New England.But the limitations of targeting a few high-profile states have become clear. Delegates are awarded proportionally based on results and because of Mrs. Clinton's lopsided victories in Southern states she has taken a commanding lead.Take the case of Michigan. For all the attention paid to Mr. Sanders's upset victory there, the tight margins in the race -- he won by 1.5 percentage points -- meant he netted just seven more pledged delegates than Mrs. Clinton. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton won 26 more delegates than Mr. Sanders in Mississippi, which she won in a landslide. So, when the voting was done that night, Mr. Sanders won the headline while Mrs. Clinton expanded her lead by 19 delegates.She now has 766 pledged delegates compared with 551 for Mr. Sanders, according to the Associated Press. Add in the ""superdelegates"" -- Democratic officials free to support whomever they choose -- and her lead is 1,231 to 576. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.For Mrs. Clinton, the dynamics are the opposite of what she faced in her 2008 race against then-Sen. Barack Obama. Mr. Obama jumped to a formidable delegate lead in the early going. She was never able to close the gap despite impressive wins in Pennsylvania and other states later in the calendar.Tom Nides, a deputy to Mrs. Clinton when she served as secretary of state and now a fundraiser for her campaign, said: ""We're basically following the Obama math in 2008. Obama did well enough in some states and really well in other states and he made the math completely impossible for Hillary to get the nomination.""An analysis by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shows that Mr. Sanders would need to win 61% of the remaining pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates to catch up to Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders said he isn't deterred, noting superdelegates are free to change their minds. They might do just that if they see him winning and come to believe he's the best bet to defeat the Republican nominee -- possibly Donald Trump -- in the fall, he said.In an appearance Sunday on CNN, Mr. Sanders said ""if we do well in a number of states and if the general sentiment becomes that Bernie Sanders is the candidate who will defeat Donald Trump"" superdelegates might ""swing over"" to his campaign.Polling shows Mrs. Clinton with substantial leads in the three other states that vote on Tuesday: Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll.Privately, both campaigns said they believe the race to be tighter. Mr. Sanders's victory in Michigan underscored the strength of his anti-free trade message, a message likely to resonate in neighboring Ohio and Illinois. He also has sought to cut into Mrs. Clinton's lead among African-Americans by taking aim at Chicago's Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel.---Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/26/16
"Election 2016: Clinton, Sanders Spar Over Immigration --- Democratic rivals debate long-ago votes and the intricacies of each other's record",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771796031?accountid=12768,"MIAMI -- Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders faced off Wednesday, a day after he scored a crucial win in the Michigan presidential primary, sparring over immigration and making direct appeals to Latino voters ahead of next week's contest in Florida.The Democratic candidates delved into the details of immigration law, invoking long-ago votes and critiquing the intricacies of each other's record. Mr. Sanders reflected on his immigrant heritage, and both candidatescited spots in the other's record that are out of step with Latino voters and immigration-rights activists.Mrs. Clinton was questioned about the right way to handle the influx of Central American children at the border. Mr. Sanders was under fire for his opposition to the 2007 bill that would have legalized people in the U.S. illegally.Under aggressive questioning from Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, Mrs. Clinton promised not to deport children already living in the U.S., and to target for deportation criminals and those posing a risk. Mr. Sanders also pledged not to send children away.But the former secretary of state stuck to her position that children newly entering the country illegally should be sent back if they don't meet qualifications for asylum or other programs that would allow them to stay legally.The eighth Democratic debate yielded few revelations, often covering well-trodden ground. Although the candidates disagreed sharply on several issues, their tone was less combative than in Sunday's matchup in Michigan.Mrs. Clinton was pressed to explain why many voters still have doubts about whether they can trust her. In Michigan, about 60% of Democratic voters said they viewed her as honest and trustworthy, compared with 80% who said the same of Mr. Sanders, according to ABC exit polls.""Obviously, it's painful for me to hear that, and I do take responsibility,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""When you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility.""She said that she would work to demonstrate that people could count on her, adding that she isn't a natural politician like her husband or President Barack Obama.For his part, Mr. Sanders tried to clarify the difference between an ""establishment politician,"" which he has dubbed Mrs. Clinton, and a ""career politician"" like himself. He said the difference is what he has focused his career on, citing his independence from Wall Street and the drug and fossil-fuel industries.During the immigration discussion, the candidates were asked a question by a woman who identified herself as a Guatemalan immigrant whose husband had been deported. She asked the candidates what they would do to keep families together. Mrs. Clinton praised the woman for having the ""courage"" to ask the question and called for more Americans to hear such stories.Mrs. Clinton also took several opportunities to refocus the discussion on Mr. Sanders's 2007 vote against the immigration bill.""Our best chance was in 2007 when [the late Sen.] Ted Kennedy led the charge,"" she said. ""I voted for that bill. Sen. Sanders voted against it.""Mr. Sanders has said during this campaign that he opposed the bill because a guest-worker program included was akin to slavery. But the debate moderators showed a video of him from the time, where he cites concerns that the new workers would drive down wages.Mr. Sanders replied that he worked to improve the program and was able to support the 2013 version of the bill.Mrs. Clinton shot back with a list of immigrant advocates who backed the 2007 version, saying they never would have supported ""modern slavery."" ""That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill,"" she said.Both candidates declined to label GOP front-runner Donald Trump a ""racist"" in response to a direct question about his references to Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers. Still, they hurled several other criticisms Mr. Trump's way. Mrs. Clinton attacked his ""trafficking in prejudice and paranoia.""Mr. Sanders recalled Mr. Trump's efforts in the so-called birther movement to ""delegitimize the president.""He noted that his own father was born in Poland, yet ""nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate,"" and that was probably because of the ""color of my skin.""Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Laura Meckler and Rebecca Ballhaus",4/26/16
"Election 2016: Despite Losses, Sanders Plans for Long Run",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769404242?accountid=12768,"Despite significant losses on Super Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to fight on for the Democratic presidential nomination, with opportunities for victory this weekend and plenty of money to fuel a long battle with front-runner Hillary Clinton.But even if he loses, Sanders aides and allies say he has already won. He's succeeded in pushing the issues he cares most about to the center of the debate. He's pushed Mrs. Clinton to the left on several points. And he is sure to emerge from this contest with strength at this summer's Democratic National Convention and as a higher-profile figure in the national debate.""The Clinton campaign is going to want it to be over, and the Democratic establishment is going to want the race to be over,"" said Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders's chief strategist. ""The voters don't want it to be over.""The Vermont senator has also proved that it's possible to fund a presidential run on small donations. Mr. Sanders raised more than $42 million in February alone, his highest monthly haul. That gives him plenty of money to move forward.By late in the evening, Mrs. Clinton had so far added 373 delegates to her total, allowing her to take a big lead in the overall delegate race, according to the Associated Press. But Democratic rules award delegates proportionally, meaning both candidates are likely to win a healthy slice even in states that they lose, and Mr. Sanders had added at least 189 delegates to his total.Mr. Sanders reminded his supporters of these rules in a speech celebrating victory in his home state of Vermont Tuesday evening.""This is not a general election. It's not winner take all,"" he said. ""If you get 52%, you get 48%, you roughly end up with same amount of delegates in a state. By the end of tonight we are going to win many hundreds of delegates.""Ahead of the results, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, emphasized the process was designed to be drawn out. ""We're going to accumulate a lot of delegates and we're going to go forward. This campaign is going all the way to the convention,"" he said in an interview. ""As long as you can fund your campaign, the process continues.""But while the delegate system makes it hard for the leader to put a challenger away, it also makes it hard for someone who falls behind to catch up.""At a certain point it does become mathematically difficult or worse to catch up, and he has to decide -- does he stay in to keep pushing a message and frame the debate, or does he get out to try and unify the party and help be a part of the preparations for the general election?"" saidMoElleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and a former Clinton aide.Mr. Sanders also may reason that if Mrs. Clinton stumbles, he would be able to benefit.Sanders aides say his next chances for a good showing will come this weekend with caucuses in Kansas and Nebraska on Saturday and, particularly, in Maine on Sunday. All three states are largely white, and he's done much better with white voters than he has with minorities. Caucuses also tend to attract the most liberal, motivated voters, which could give him an edge.Also voting Saturday is Louisiana, where half the Democratic primary voters were African-American in 2008, giving Mrs. Clinton an advantage that could offset Sanders gains elsewhere.After that, the Sanders campaign foresees a ""showdown"" in Michigan, which hosts a Clinton-Sanders debate on Sunday and its Democratic primary on Tuesday.Also voting next Tuesday will be Mississippi, another Southern state rich with African-American voters and expected to be a Clinton stronghold. If Mr. Sanders does manage to win in Michigan, Mrs. Clinton will probably counter with Mississippi.Credit: By Laura Meckler",4/26/16
Election 2016: Sanders Plays Down Long Odds --- The Democrat says he sees a path to win and keeps up his swipes against front-runner,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768525479?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he has a pathway to win the nomination, playing down a stinging defeat in South Carolina that reflected heavy losses among African-American voters and tested the viability of his campaign.""We got decimated,"" Mr. Sanders said Sunday on NBC. But he said that ""we're looking to the future -- not looking back,"" and that while ""it's going to be a tough fight, I think we can pull it off.""On Saturday in South Carolina, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, won 74% of the vote to 26% for Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator.Mr. Sanders on CBS predicted his campaign would do well in several states holding Democratic contests on Tuesday, including Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma, Massachusetts and Vermont.Looking further ahead, Mr. Sanders said he could win the delegate-rich states of California, Michigan and New York.On Sunday in Oklahoma City, Mr. Sanders fired up the crowd with his signature brand of economic populism, calling for a higher minimum wage, increased Social Security benefits, paid family leave, government-guaranteed health care for all and tuition-free college. He begged voters to turn out at the polls.""The only way we make changes is when millions of people stand up and fight back,"" Mr. Sanders told an audience filled with cheering young people.Support among younger votes was a bright spot in the South Carolina contest for Mr. Sanders, who predicted that his left-of-center politics would prove appealing as the contest heads beyond the four early nominating states.""Tuesday, we're going to have over 800 delegates being selected,"" Mr. Sanders said on CBS. ""I think we're going to win a very good share of those delegates. The important point is that people throughout this country are resonating to our message.""Mr. Sanders continued to press his case against Mrs. Clinton, hitting her for being backed by a super PAC, which allows unlimited donations from large contributors, and calling on her to release transcripts of paid speeches made to Goldman Sachs Group. ""It has to be an unbelievably great speech,"" Mr. Sanders jabbed.In seeking to sharpen the contrast with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders also turned his attention to foreign policy. That subject fueled then-Sen. Barack Obama's rise to the White House in 2008, when he relentlessly attacked Mrs. Clinton for voting to authorize the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq when she was a senator from New York.Mr. Sanders, who opposed the invasion, continues to hammer Mrs. Clinton for that vote as well as her later support, while she was secretary of state, for military intervention in Libya. In both cases, the U.S. intervention helped topple dictators but failed to create stable political systems in the aftermath.""You can't just go forward with regime change -- you've got to be thinking about the day after,"" Mr. Sanders said on NBC. ""I think her approach to foreign policy and mine are just quite different.""Mrs. Clinton has said she made a mistake in voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq invasion, but she also has said that she understands the complexities of the Middle East better than Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders on Sunday picked up support from Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a member of National Guard. Ms. Gabbard, who becomes the fourth Democratic lawmaker in Congress to endorse the Vermont senator, quit her post as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in order to back Mr. Sanders.Ms. Gabbard said it was important to have a commander in chief ""who exercises good judgment"" so that ""we don't continue to find ourselves in these failures that have resulted in chaos in the Middle East.""Credit: By Siobhan Hughes and David Harrison",4/26/16

"Hillary Clinton Wins Four States, Bernie Sanders Takes One; Democratic front-runner's chief task now shifts to unifying a fractured party",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784322487?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton swept to four primary victories over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders Tuesday night in a showing that makes her the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee.Mrs. Clinton's chief task now shifts from winning more states to unifying a fractured party and persuading supporters of Mr. Sanders to coalesce behind her. Her first step appeared to be turning down the rhetorical temperature, giving Mr. Sanders's supporters space to move in her direction.Mrs. Clinton took Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut , the three largest prizes of the evening, as well as Delaware , while Mr. Sanders pulled off a win in Rhode Island .Ahead of Tuesday's contests, Mrs. Clinton had already amassed a nearly insurmountable delegate lead. But so far, the Sanders campaign is showing little sign it is ready to step aside and make it easier for her to capture the nomination. The race has exposed deep fissures between Sanders and Clinton backers rooted in age, race and ideology, as Mr. Sanders built a passionate following among young, white, liberal voters.A new poll shows Mr. Sanders is the most popular person in the race in either party among young voters. The Harvard Institute of Politics survey showed that among 18-to-29-year-olds, 54% viewed him positively, 31% negatively. Mrs. Clinton, in contrast, was the favorite of African-Americans, centrists and older Democrats. In the Harvard poll, only 37% of young voters viewed Mrs. Clinton in a positive light.Related* Front-runners Tighten Their Grip* Northeast Primaries: Recap* Sanders Mentions Elizabeth Warren as Possible Running Mate* Pennsylvania Shows Hillary Clinton's New Keystone* The Delegate Math Facing Clinton and Sanders* The Bernie Sanders Effect: Moving Millennials Left""We have to be respectful, dignified and begin the process of bringing everyone together,"" said Tom Nides, a top deputy to Mrs. Clinton during her years as secretary of state and now a senior executive at Morgan Stanley. Any effort to push out Mr. Sanders, he said, ""will trigger the opposite.""One question facing Clinton allies is when they can become more direct in calling for Mr. Sanders to focus on party unity and concede he can't win the nomination.Speaking to cheering supporters in Philadelphia, Mrs. Clinton stressed the goal of bringing the party together. ""We will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together,"" she said.Mrs. Clinton offered her most direct outreach to date to Mr. Sanders's backers, saying she shares his priorities like fighting inequality. ""Whether you support Sen. Sanders or support me, there's much more that unites us than divides us,"" Mrs. Clinton said.Mr. Sanders said late Tuesday he was staying in the race, but suggested that he recognized his biggest impact might be in pushing the party's message to the left. ""This campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform,"" he said in a statement.Polling suggests the party is becoming less unified, not more. In March, 78% of Democratic primary voters said they would be satisfied if Mrs. Clinton were the nominee. In April, that fell to 73%, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. Asked if they could see themselves supporting Mrs. Clinton for president, just 58% of Sanders primary voters said yes, with 40% saying no, according to the April poll.This has led to some uneasiness among party leaders, who fear that scars from the hard-fought campaign could make it hard to unify the party for the general election. As the race reaches the endgame, bitterness is evident from some rank-and-file Sanders voters.At a polling place in Providence, R.I., Christine Kolasa, a retired mortgage-banking manager in her 60s, said she had voted for Mr. Sanders and would never vote for Mrs. Clinton in a general election.""There isn't enough money in the world to make me vote for Hillary,"" said Ms. Kolasa. ""She says whatever it takes to get elected.""Cesar Barreto, 51, a Sanders supporter who voted at a Rockville, Md., polling place, said the Vermont senator should ""fight to the very bitter end."" But he said that if it came to a Trump-Clinton match-up, ""given the two evils, I'd probably vote for Hillary.""The candidates came into Tuesday's contest with Mrs. Clinton leading in pledged delegates 1,428 to 1,153. With superdelegates--party leaders who can support any candidate they choose--added to the mix, her lead stood at a more formidable 1,946 to 1,192.A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination. The five states that voted Tuesday have 384 delegates.Mrs. Clinton entered the evening with an advantage of 275 pledged delegates. Preliminary results from the Associated Press showed she would push that lead to more than 350.At a televised MSNBC town hall event on the eve of the vote, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders said in separate appearances that it was the other one's job to unite the party behind Mrs. Clinton if she becomes the nominee.The best way for her to mobilize his supporters, Mr. Sanders said, was for her to adopt pillars of his liberal agenda, including a single-payer health-care system, a carbon tax and free tuition at public colleges. Mrs. Clinton has supported none of these ideas.Were she to pivot now and embrace Mr. Sanders's positions, some of her supporters point out, she would be vulnerable to charges of flip-flopping. Such a switch would also make it tougher to win over moderates and independents in a general-election showdown with Republicans.For her part, Mrs. Clinton bristled at the suggestion that to win over Mr. Sanders and his backers, she needs to adopt his agenda. Recalling her fight with then-Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race, she said, ""We got to the end in June, and I did not put down conditions. I didn't say, 'You know what, if Sen. Obama does X, Y and Z, maybe I'll support him.' ""She added, ""I concluded after it was over in June that Sen. Obama was going to be the nominee and I didn't want to hurt him.""Bickering between the Sanders and Clinton camps unfolded throughout the day on Tuesday.In a CNN interview, Mr. Sanders's wife, Jane Sanders, raised the issue of Mrs. Clinton's refusal to release transcripts of paid speeches she has given to Wall Street firms, while parrying calls for Mr. Sanders to release more of his tax returns.Mrs. Clinton has released tax returns dating back to the 1970s, and during a debate on April 14, Mr. Sanders said he would release past years' returns, citing the campaign's busy schedule as the cause for any delays. But the day after that debate, Mr. Sanders released his full 2014 return, and he hasn't released any since.Mrs. Sanders on Tuesday placed a new condition on the release of tax records covering earlier years. ""What's interesting is we released the 2014, Secretary Clinton hasn't released the transcript yet,"" Mrs. Sanders said. ""Why don't we wait to see what happens?"" Asked by CNN if she was linking the release of tax records to Mrs. Clinton's release of speech transcripts, Mrs. Sanders said, ""Yep.""At the same time, a fundraising solicitation from the Sanders campaign used harsh language in describing Clinton campaign tactics.The letter says the Clinton campaign is trying to get Mr. Sanders to tone down his rhetoric and accusing him of aiding Republican front-runner Donald Trump.The email, from Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, said the Clinton campaign, in describing Sanders campaign methods, has ""used language reserved for traitors to our country, saying we are 'giving aid and comfort' to Trump.""While Mr. Sanders's path to winning the nomination is growing increasingly narrow by his own admission, staying in the race and continuing to attract money and support could strengthen his hand as he tries to push the Democratic message in a more progressive direction.Democratic operatives said that whatever the current tensions, the party will unify in the face of a Republican opponent, especially one as polarizing as either of the two leading GOP candidates, Mr. Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.The Democrats' divisions, they added, are nothing compared with the splits in the GOP, with the top candidates calling each other names and threats of a chaotic Republican convention in Cleveland.Should Mrs. Clinton win the nomination, Mr. Sanders will support her over the Republican nominee, his advisers say. The question is how ardent will he be in backing her.Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, a loyal Clinton supporter, recalled getting a phone call from her at the end of the 2008 race telling him she was dropping out and asking him to endorse Mr. Obama. That was a message Mr. Nutter said he heeded.""I asked her, 'What do you want me to do?' "" Mr. Nutter said. ""She said, 'I want you to give him the same support you gave me.' And from that moment on, I was all Sen. Obama all the time.""Richard Rubin, Jennifer Levitz and Byron Tau contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",4/27/16

"Bring on a Third-Party Candidate; Establishment America deserves disruption, but not of the Sanders or Trump type. Here's how to do it.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783999433?accountid=12768,"I have spent the past two decades in the Washington, D.C., bubble--the heart of Establishment America--covering politics and building a company, Politico, focused solely on politics. But I've also spent a lot of time in my hometown of Oshkosh, Wis., and my adopted hometown of Lincoln, Maine, two blue-collar towns in the heart of Normal America.Here are my two big takeaways: Normal America is right that Establishment America has grown fat, lazy, conventional and deserving of radical disruption. And the best, perhaps only way to disrupt the establishment is by stealing a lot of Donald Trump's and Bernie Sanders's tricks and electing a third-party candidate.Mr. Trump's vulgar approach to politics is a terrific middle finger to the establishment but a terrible political and governing paradigm. Same goes for Sanders-style socialism. But if someone turned the critique, passion and disdain shared by the two movements into a new one, they could change the system in meaningful ways. Only an outside force can knock Washington out of its governing rut--and the presidency is the only place with the power to do it.Here's a template for pulling this off:* The candidate has to come from outside the political system. Voters are beaten down or bubbling with anger. They watched as the two parties chose selfish spats and rarely dared to do the right thing, or hard things or often anything. Mr. Trump has shown they want a true outsider, even a deeply flawed one. The way to win is to rail against Big--Big Business, Big Media, Big Government, Big Establishment.Mr. Sanders is right that the system is rigged against normal people. Everyone outside of the GOP establishment seems to agree on eradicating corporate welfare and tax-avoidance tricks for the super wealthy. Read the Panama Papers for ammunition on legal tax dodging. Then read the March 26 Economist cover story, ""Winners Take All,"" on how America's small businesses are getting shafted by the lack of true competition.Take it a step further and force the wealthy to forfeit their entitlement benefits. And everyone loves socking it to Congress. Mandate that lawmakers go home after serving instead of profiting off their service. Also force them to get outside of the D.C. bubble by holding months-long sessions in different sections of Normal America.* The candidate has to be authentic and capable of having a rolling, candid, transparent conversation with voters on social and conventional media. Voters aren't dopes: They want an unvarnished look at their future president's personality and ideas. They can tolerate uncomfortable truths. But they have to come from someone comfortable in his or her own skin. If voters trust the person isn't full of it, they are clearly willing to think differently about issues. Exploiting this ideological ambiguity is key.The ideal candidate would write a very specific agenda in normal, conversational language, not whatever nonsensical language today's political class was taught to speak. He or she would engage voters daily on social media, with fun and flare. (Think Trump with impulse control and better spelling.) The candidate would inundate voters with transparency and specificity, even when it hurts. And exploit cable TV's addiction to whatever is hot and new. Mr. Trump has shown how technology has made money less important in modern politics.* Exploit the fear factor. The candidate should be from the military or immediately announce someone with modern-warfare expertise or experience as running mate. People are scared. Terrorism is today's World War and Americans want a theory for dealing with it. President Obama has established an intriguing precedent of using drone technology and intelligence to assassinate terrorists before they strike. A third-party candidate could build on death-by-drones by outlining the type of modern weapons, troops and war powers needed to keep America safe. And make plain when he or she will use said power. Do it with very muscular language--there is no market for nuance in the terror debate.* Learn from the mistakes of Messrs. Trump and Sanders. Anger has its limits. The fringe can win primaries but it can't win national elections. You draw in the 40% of people who don't vote or big blocks of dissatisfied independents with a call to a higher purpose. In this case, the purpose is cleaning up the mess the leaders of the two parties created.* Use the Internet revolution for the greater good. Social media allows us to tweet our every thought, snap our every mood and Facebook our every fantasy, but it hasn't done much to create shared purpose. We have breathtaking technology to find a ride or a date with the swipe of a screen. Those same innovators could help create a ""National App"" to match every kid who needs a mentor with a mentor, every person who wants to volunteer with someone or some group in need; every veteran with people and companies who want to reward his or her service with thanks, help or a job. Also, call on Silicon Valley technologist to do tours of service to bring data solutions and efficiencies to our aging governmental systems.Right now, millions of young people are turned on by a 74-old-year socialist scolding Wall Street; millions of others by a reality-TV star with a 1950s view of women. Why not recruit Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg to head a third-party movement? Maybe we can convince Michael Bloomberg to help fund the movement with the billions he planned to spend on his own campaign--and then recruit him to run Treasury and advise the president.I will even throw out a possible name for the movement: The Innovation Party. Who is against innovation, especially when winning campaigns are almost always about the future?All it needs is a candidate.Mr. VandeHei is a co-founder and former CEO of Politico.Credit: By Jim VandeHei",4/27/16

Elijah Cummings among its signatories.Medivation shares fell 6.1% the day after the letter's release, with Astellas stock declining at a slight 2.1%, compared with a 0.9% increase in the S&P 500.Astellas said the $129,000 price tag ""fails to reflect what payers or patients actually pay for the medicine.""Of the 20,000 patients on Xtandi last year, 81% of the privately insured paid $300 or less out of pocket a year and 79% of patients on Medicare had no out-of-pocket costs a month, the company said in a written statement. the company also noted its access program made the drug free for more than 2,000 advanced-prostate-cancer patients last year.The nonprofits Knowledge Ecology International and the Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment first petitioned the National Institutes of Health for such a hearing in a mid-January letter, asking the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense to revoke Medivation's exclusive patent rights.The NIH has been petitioning for such a move, termed ""march-in rights"" and spelled out in the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, in prior years.In 2004, the agency granted a hearing on the pricing of an antiretroviral medication put out by Abbott Laboratories, but it decided ""the issue of drug pricing is one that would be more appropriately addressed by Congress, as it considers these matters in a larger context.""However, Abbott did lower the drug's price for programs such as Medicaid and improved its financial assistance programs in the hearing's wake, the Monday letter noted.Medivation wrote in an emailed statement that the bid for march-in rights for Xtandi ""does not meet the criteria laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act nor is it an appropriate way to address perceived pricing disparities in different health care systems.""""Furthermore, we believe taking measures such as exercising 'march-in' rights would stifle the kind of innovation and collaborations with public institutions which have resulted in innovative medicines, such as Xtandi, that have made meaningful clinical improvements in the lives of patients,"" the company said.Several other advocacy organizations joined KEI and UACT's request in late March, with the congressional letter following a week later.""Price can be a clear barrier to access for consumers, and despite this law being in place for over 35 years, the NIH has never used this broad and powerful authority to protect consumers from excessive prescription drug prices,"" the congressional letter said.Write to Emma Court at ecourt@marketwatch.comCredit: By Emma Court",4/27/16
"Election 2016: Wisconsin to Test Cruz, Sanders --- Anti-Trump trend favors Texan, history of progressives bodes well for Democrat",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775087431?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin's primary, up next on the presidential nominating calendar, presents a key test for the second-place Democratic and Republican candidates: If Sens. Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz can't win there, they face a diminishing belief that they can win in states that follow.That is because both Mr. Cruz, who is chasing GOP front-runner Donald Trump, and Mr. Sanders, who lags behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic delegate count, hold distinct advantages in Wisconsin.With two weeks between Tuesday's contests in Arizona and Utah and Wisconsin's vote on April 5, the candidates will be able to put down roots in a way they haven't since before the February contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.Among the GOP, the action has already started. Mr. Cruz is scheduled to appear at a forum Wednesday in Waukesha County, a suburban Milwaukee area that is home to the state's largest concentration of GOP voters and crucial to any Republican's electoral hopes. He also announced four additional stops Thursday and Friday in Madison and the Fox Valley, the GOP-rich area between Milwaukee and Green Bay.To stress the importance of Wisconsin, the Cruz campaign put out a call for volunteers to come to the state to establish a ""Camp Cruz,"" which it hadn't done since South Carolina's Feb. 20 primary.""Cruz has an opportunity, but he also has a lot of work to do because most Wisconsinites don't know a lot about him,"" said Mark Graul, a veteran Republican operative from Green Bay who organized the state for George W. Bush in 2004.The state will award 42 Republican delegates and 86 pledged to the Democrats.For Mr. Trump, Wisconsin's population distribution poses a particular disadvantage. He is highly unpopular in the Milwaukee area, where local conservative talk-radio hosts have been lamenting his rise for months.An analysis by Marquette Law School of its recent poll, publishedSaturdayin the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, found Mr. Trump is viewed positively by just 25% and negatively by 64% of GOP voters in the three suburban counties that ring Milwaukee. But in nearly three dozen rural counties in the state's west and north, the picture is reversed: Mr. Trump's favorable ratings are 21 percentage points higher than his negative ones.""In southeast Wisconsin, the local conservative talk-radio hosts have not followed the lead of the national guys,"" said Charlie Sykes, who regularly criticizes Mr. Trump on his morning radio show in Milwaukee and is hosting Mr. Cruz at the Wednesdayforum in Waukesha. ""Trump has not had the talk-radio air cover here that he's had elsewhere.""Mr. Trump's Wisconsin footprint is light, and no significant elected official in the state backs his campaign. Mr. Trump's aides didn't respond to a request for his Wisconsin endorsements.But the New Yorker in recent weeks suggested putting a Wisconsinite on the Supreme Court: Judge Diane Sykes of the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The George W. Bush appointee used to be married to Mr. Sykes, the radio host.Almost the entire state GOP backed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's presidential bid, which he terminated in September amid low poll numbers. Mr. Walker hasn't endorsed a candidate since, and declined an interview request.For the Democrats, the latest polling shows an even race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator is extremely popular among liberals in and around Madison, where he held his first major rally, drawing 20,000 people in July. Wisconsin's demographics also tend to mirror those in neighboring Michigan and Minnesota, both of which Mr. Sanders won.Also helping Mr. Sanders is Wisconsin's history of backing liberal mavericks, going back to Sen. ""Fighting"" Bob La Follette, who founded the progressive movement a century ago. ""Time and time again in Democratic primaries we go for the person who is much more out there on the progressive end of it,"" said Thad Nation, who was an aide to the state's last Democratic governor, Jim Doyle.Mrs. Clinton has her own strength in Milwaukee, home to the vast majority of the state's blacks and Hispanics.And while Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have focused their ire of late on Mr. Trump, in Wisconsin they both figure to take aim at Mr. Walker, who remains a highly polarizing figure despised by activist Democrats.""Just mentioning Scott Walker will light a room on fire,"" said Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, who hasn't endorsed a candidate. ""For the base, that's filet mignon wrapped in bacon.""---Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein",4/27/16
An Empty Obama-Clinton-Sanders Plan on Drug Costs,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774716788?accountid=12768,"President Obama's latest budget includes proposals -- echoed or one-upped on the presidential-campaign trail by Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton -- that would require pharmaceutical companies to release data on the cost of research and development (R&D) and the extent of discounts offered to insurers for each drug brought to market. Yet the key numbers already are disclosed freely -- and we know how to get better value from medicines and improve their affordability to patients.The company I lead, Lilly, discloses its annual R&D spending in audited financial statements every year, like other public companies. Lilly's number for 2015 was $4.8 billion -- part of the $50 billion invested in R&D each year by the members of our industry association alone. That's more than 20% of all R&D spending by all U.S. businesses. Seen against that staggering total, the proposal to mandate the nearly impossible task of assembling drug-by-drug R&D-spending figures misses the whole point.Pharmaceutical companies' R&D feeds innovation from the earliest identification of leads through to clinical trials, real-world data collection and the refinement of existing treatments. It includes the cost of myriad failures -- part of every scientific enterprise -- along with further research on approved medicines, right up to their patent expirations. Money made on the sale of today's new medicines feeds all of the indispensable streams in this complex ecosystem.Averages are easy enough to come by -- a new academic study in the Journal of Health Economics says it takes about $2.6 billion in R&D investment per new medicine launched. Calculating a precise number for an individual product is quite another matter. Consider Lilly's investment of billions of dollars in R&D related to Alzheimer's disease over the last quarter century. Since there are several candidates in our pipeline that emerged from past work, to which future product and in what proportion should these costs be allocated? And to what end?The key insight is beyond dispute. Developing medicines is risky, expensive and time-consuming, and everyone would be better off if it were less so. Rather than meaningless disclosure mandates, policy efforts instead should encourage whatever can be done, without compromising patient safety, to shave precious weeks off development and regulatory-approval timelines.There are effective ways to do that. For example, pooling access to potential new molecules and sharing ""pre-competitive"" research on promising treatment paths could avoid costly duplication. Industry and the FDA could ramp up the use of ""adaptive clinical trials"" that refocus themselves based on real-time findings rather than starting over. And large-scale efforts to capture the real-world outcomes of treatments in genetically profiled patients -- and feed these insights back to R&D labs -- would accelerate progress significantly.Mandating further disclosure of discounts negotiated by drug companies also is a route to nowhere. Lest anyone doubt that the discounts are substantial, allow me to report freely that the average net prices paid last year by Lilly's customers in the U.S. ranged from a high of 67% of list prices paid by commercial health plans to a low of 19% paid by government purchasers including Medicaid. That's right: The average discount off list price was more than 80% for government payers.I'm not cherry-picking these figures -- they cover Lilly's entire portfolio of established products. But forcing Lilly, or other companies, to disclose product-by-product and payer-by-payer discounts would be an unprecedented affront to free-market competition.The list prices of medicines that feed media sensationalism are paid by essentially no institutional or government buyer in a hotly competitive marketplace. Yet affordability remains a problem for many patients. That's because insured patients in the U.S. today pay an average of about 20% of their prescription-drug costs out-of-pocket compared with about 5% of their hospital costs. Some patients' cost shares are much worse -- due to complex insurance ""tier"" systems for drugs and the rise of ""combined deductibles,"" in which drug expenses get lumped together with major-medical costs, and benefits hinge on reaching a high expense threshold.The insurance bias against medicines needs to be addressed head-on, at the very least so that patients benefit from the savings negotiated by their insurers. Clearing the Food and Drug Administration's huge backlog of generic-drug applications would also be a great help.Lilly and Anthem, a major insurer, recently asked for changes in federal regulations that make it difficult to set up ""outcomes-based contracts."" These would link payment for a drug to the presentation of evidence that patients achieved the health benefits expected from the drug, for example.The realities that determine the cost of medicines to patients don't require mandated disclosures. They are as plain as day. They simply need to be acknowledged and acted upon rather than distorted and ignored.---Dr. Lechleiter, a chemist, is chairman, president and CEO of Eli Lilly and Company.Credit: By John C.

Sanders Scores Michigan Upset,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771382657?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders proved his grit in the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday, defeating Hillary Clinton in Michigan and showing strength for the first time in a large, racially diverse state far from his home base of New England.Mrs. Clinton easily captured Mississippi, completing a clean sweep of the Deep South powered by her overwhelming popularity among African-American voters in the region. But Mr. Sanders, in winning his most populous state this primary season, made inroads with black voters in Michigan, according to exit polls, winning 30% of the state's African-American primary vote.With 92% of precincts counted in Michigan, Mr. Sanders had 50% of the vote to 48% for Mrs. Clinton. The state will award, proportionally, 130 pledged delegates to the summer Democratic convention.The win gives Mr. Sanders a jolt of momentum at an important moment in the race. He and Mrs. Clinton face off Wednesday in a debate in Florida. Nearly 700 convention delegates are at stake in the next round of voting, next Tuesday, and the Sanders camp hopes the Michigan result will reverberate in two other large Midwestern states that vote then: Ohio and Illinois.The other three states to vote next Tuesday are Florida, Missouri and North Carolina.Both candidates had fought hard in Michigan. Trailing in delegates and written off by some Democrats, Mr. Sanders visited the state repeatedly and aired TV ads for the past three weeks in hopes of proving he could go toe-to-toe with Mrs. Clinton in a large industrial state.""Not only is Michigan the gateway to the rest of the industrial Midwest, the results there show that we are a national campaign,"" Mr. Sanders said in a statement. ""We already have won in the Midwest, New England and the Great Plains, and as more people get to know more about who we are and what our views are, we're going to do very well.""Mrs. Clinton's blowout win in Mississippi -- she led Mr. Sanders by some 67 percentage points with 94% of precincts reported -- means she could end the night with a wider delegate lead over her rival. Still, the Michigan loss is a serious setback given the time she spent campaigning in the state. Mrs. Clinton put the water crisis in the city of Flint front-and-center, using her national platform to get more money and assistance for a city plagued by polluted drinking water. On the trail, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, repeatedly invoked her response to the Flint crisis as evidence she has the temperament and judgment to be president. The appeal fell short, with Mr. Sanders winning the bulk of counties across the state, although Mrs. Clinton won the counties in the populous Detroit region.""There are similarities between Michigan and parts of Ohio and Illinois that have experienced high levels of deindustrialization due to policies that Secretary Clinton has supported over and over again,"" said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager.That line of attack has been made by Mr. Sanders himself, highlighting Mrs. Clinton's early support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Pacific Rim nations and for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by her husband in the 1990s.Mr. Sanders had notched wins in eight of the first 20 Democratic contests coming into Tuesday, but his victories generally had come in small states with overwhelmingly white electorates or that use a caucus format that attracts grass-roots activists, who have migrated to his campaign.The result is a commanding lead for Mrs. Clinton in the tally of pledged delegates. Coming into Tuesday, not counting the so-called superdelegates that aren't awarded by voters, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders 694 delegates to 477. Mississippi awarded 36 delegates.After Mrs. Clinton addressed supporters in Cleveland Tuesday night, and before the Michigan winner was announced, her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters she would increase her delegate lead. ""Our strategy is built around accruing delegates,"" she said.A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed the Democratic race tightening nationally, with Mrs. Clinton's lead over Mr. Sanders narrowing to nine points among Democratic primary voters.In February, the former secretary of state led by 11 points, and in January, she led by 24 points in the poll.The senator has expended limited resources in several states that Mrs. Clinton won by wide margins. But his campaign long counted on Michigan to serve as a launchpad to next week's primaries.Tuesdayin Ferndale, Mich., voters split between the two Democrats. Elizabeth and Gerald Collins both backed Mrs. Clinton. ""I think she has the best chance to win,"" Mrs.Collins, 51, said. ""I like where she stands on many of the issues.""Mr. Collins, 58, added that he believes people aren't ready for Mr.Sanders and his ideas.Josh Hartwig, 29, disagreed, casting his vote for Mr. Sandersbecause, he said, he supports the ""common man.""Clinton campaign officials have long argued the Democratic nomination would be decided in March. And after scoring eight victories on SuperTuesdayand winning Louisiana this past weekend, Mrs. Clinton enteredTuesday well positioned to build on her delegate lead. The goal, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has said, is to compete everywhere and methodically amass delegates, making it mathematically impossible for Mr. Sanders to catch up.The Sanders campaign believes the race is winnable, saying the map only gets more favorable. The calendar was ""front-loaded"" with Southern states loyal to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, formerly the Arkansas governor, Mr. Weaver said.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",4/27/16
Election 2016: Michigan Surprise Shows Power of Sanders Coalition,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771382647?accountid=12768,"The Bernie Sanders coalition -- a mix of young voters, liberals and independents -- is still a potent force in the Democratic primary race.With his unexpected win in Michigan's primary on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders proved his voting base still has power, just as the nominating calendar is about to turn to similar Midwestern states, including Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin.Mr. Sanders's voting base had little visibility in Mississippi on Tuesday, where Hillary Clinton won an overwhelming victory on the strength of African-American voters, who made up more than 60% of the voter pool.But in Michigan, where black voters accounted only for about one-quarter of the electorate and gave Mrs. Clinton less of a boost, the Sanders coalition held far more sway.Mr. Sanders carried a commanding 8 in 10 voters under age 30, according to preliminary results of surveys of voters after they cast ballots. He won more than two-thirds of voters under age 45. And while Mrs. Clinton won a lopsided share of African-American voters, Mr. Sanders won nearly 6 in 10 white voters, according to exit polls reported by CNN and other media.A similar coalition could make for close races in other Midwest states with manufacturing roots, where the voter pools look more like those of Michigan than of other states that have voted so far.Its white, non-Hispanic population, at 76% of all residents, looks similar to the 80% share of white residents in Ohio, 78% in Pennsylvania and 82% in Wisconsin. The percentage of people 25 or older with a bachelor's degree, at 26%, is in line with those three states.Mr. Sanders has already won one upper Midwest state, Minnesota, where Democrats held caucuses rather than a primary.The Tuesday night results have a message for both Democratic candidates. For Mrs. Clinton it is that her campaign needs a rationale and message as compelling as Mr. Sanders's call for a ""political revolution"" against the wealthy and Wall Street, which has caught the imagination of the party's liberals and young voters.For Mr. Sanders, it is that winning the nomination in a racially diverse party is difficult without winning support from nonwhite voters.Mr. Sanders's weak support among African-Americans has severely hampered him in the South, but he may find diverse states outside the South to be friendlier ground. He won 30% of African-American voters in Michigan, his best showing in any state for which there are exit polls and a far larger share than the single-digit support he had drawn in several Southern primaries.As in other Southern states, Mrs. Clinton's victory in Mississippi rested on support from nearly 9 in 10 African-American voters, exit polls showed.Donald Trump carried Mississippi's Republican primary. Like Mrs. Clinton, he has won the contests in Southern states, including those in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.As in prior contests, Mr. Trump's support was strongest among voters without a college degree and those on the lower end of the income scale. But he swept almost every other group as well, even expanding the coalition that had delivered other Southern states to him.Mr. Trump won among Republican Party members and independents who cast ballots. He carried evangelical Christians and non-evangelicals, foiling Sen. Ted Cruz, who had hoped to build a lead among evangelicals. Mr. Cruz, a favorite of social conservatives, carried voters who rated themselves ""very conservative,"" as he had in prior contests.Credit: By Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni",4/27/16
Election 2016 -- Analysis: White Males Propel Trump -- and Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771382643?accountid=12768,"Tuesday's primary elections underscored an emerging, central reality of the 2016 presidential campaign: This is the year of the angry white male.Those white males are the voters who propelled Donald Trump to convincing victories Tuesday in Michigan and Mississippi, as they have elsewhere. And they may determine whether he can roll on next week in a series of big industrial states.Here's what is less noticed: Dissatisfied white males also helped propel Sen. Bernie Sanders to a stunning victory over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic contest in Michigan, and may keep him in the game for many weeks to come.All of this further suggests they may be the swing voters who decide the general election in November, when the critical question could well be whether Democrats can win enough of them to supplement their big advantages among women and minority voters.The effect was most obvious in watching Mr. Trump roll up two more big wins Tuesday. In Michigan, 52% of the Republican primary electorate was male, exit polls indicated. Mr. Trump won them going away, 43% to 23% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Meantime, he lost among women, 30% for Sen. Ted Cruz to 28% for Mr. Trump.The story was similar in Mississippi. Mr. Trump won men by 20 percentage points, exit polls indicated. There, he won women, but by a mere 9 percentage points.So, the more male the Republican electorate, the better for Mr. Trump. Also, the angrier as well.In Mississippi, 41% of Republicans described their feelings toward the federal government as ""angry"" -- and Mr. Trump won a whopping 57% of them. Meanwhile in Michigan, 32% of Republican voters said they were angry at the federal government, and Mr. Trump won 48% of them, compared with 24% for Mr. Cruz.And what are these folks angry about? Here's a pretty good clue:When voters were asked in Michigan if trade with other countries creates jobs or takes away jobs, just over half of GOP respondents said it takes away jobs -- this is in the Republican Party that once was the bastion of strong belief in free trade. And among those who see trade as a job killer, Mr. Trump won going away, 42% to 23% for Mr. Cruz.Here's a bit more evidence that the Trump army is made up of people angry over the belief the economy has left them behind: Among white college graduates in Michigan, he lost to Mr. Kasich. But among whites without a college degree, he won by almost 20 percentage points.Perhaps more interesting, angry white males are sustaining the Sanders campaign, not just the Trump campaign.In Michigan, they kept him nearly even with Mrs. Clinton, offsetting her big advantage among women and among minorities. Among women, exit polls indicate, he finished just behind Mrs. Clinton. But among men, he won easily, 54% to 44%.Like Mr. Trump, he seemed to do especially well among those who consider themselves stuck outside the economic mainstream. Among those who considered income inequality the top issue, he beat Mrs. Clinton 60% to 39%. And among those who think trade takes away jobs, he won 56% to 43%.Together, in other words, Messrs. Trump and Sanders are collapsing what had become, in the 1990s, something of a bipartisan consensus in favor of free trade. And angry white males, many of whom feel trade has marginalized their jobs and prospects, are leading the way.In the end, it may well be that these voters are sufficient to propel Mr. Trump to the GOP nomination; we may well know for sure after primaries next week in the big industrial states of Ohio, Illinois and Missouri. But they probably aren't enough to carry Mr. Sanders to the Democratic nomination.Which would set up a fascinating fall battle. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, Mrs. Clinton beats Mr. Trump in a hypothetical election matchup, 51% to 38%. But among white men? He wins comfortably, 53% to 35%.Could he hold on to such an advantage, and build up elsewhere? Or would she eat into and undermine his clearest pillar of strength? On such questions may November's outcome be decided.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",4/27/16
Election 2016: Clinton Faces Test in Wooing Sanders Fans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771109327?accountid=12768,"LINCOLN, Neb. -- It is rare for the crowd to boo at a Bernie Sanders rally. When it happens, it is usually at the point he invokes the name of his opponent in the Democratic presidential race, Hillary Clinton.With Mrs. Clinton holding a substantial lead in the race for convention delegates, many Sanders loyalists are grappling with an uncomfortable question: If he loses, would they back her?Interviews with a number of Sanders supporters present an unclear picture. Some say they wouldn't vote for the former senator and secretary of state if she wins the party nomination. Others say they would, reluctantly. Still others see strengths in Mrs. Clinton and would unconditionally back her for the White House.The Democratic primary fight has been nowhere near as divisive as the Republican one. Still, in a campaign stop Monday in Grand Rapids, Mich., Mrs. Clinton made clear she is aware of what might lie ahead as she talked about the hard-fought 2008 race against Barack Obama and her work in helping the nominee pull in her supporters once he wrapped up the nomination that June.That effort wasn't entirely successful -- one pro-Clinton group held out and defiantly campaigned for Republican nominee John McCain.""I had a lot of passionate supporters who did not feel like they wanted to support then-Sen. Obama. I worked as hard as I could. I nominated him at the convention. I made the case, because he and I shared a lot of the same views,"" she said. ""I would hope to be able to enlist Bernie in helping me reach out to his supporters if I am so fortunate to be the nominee.""Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, has given every indication he would endorse Mrs. Clinton if she wins the nomination. He says he likes and respects her and has set limits on how negative he is willing to go.But it isn't clear how many of his die-hard supporters would fall in line. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed half the Sanders supporters have a positive view of Mrs. Clinton, but 31% have a negative one. About four in 10 Sanders supporters say they worry about Mrs. Clinton's ""ties to Wall Street and millions in speaking fees.""At a speech in Lincoln last week, Mr. Sanders elicited boos when he mentioned Wall Street donations collected by a pro-Clinton super PAC.Kathleen Worcester, a 42-year-old who came to hear Mr. Sanders at a rally last week in Portland, Maine, said she is unsure of what she would do if her candidate doesn't win. Mrs. Clinton ""seems like a moderate conservative to me,"" she said.Clinton aides say she has long been mindful that, as a nominee, she would need the support of Sanders backers, many of whom see her as the embodiment of the establishment politics they hope the senator would vanquish.At times, she has been sharply critical of Mr. Sanders -- the two candidates interrupted and talked over each other at a testy debate Sunday night in Flint, Mich. -- but she has also tried to direct her barbs at Republicans in hopes of unifying Democrats behind a common enemy.""We have differences, but those differences pale in comparison to what we see going on with the Republicans right now,"" she said in Grand Rapids.And she has offered overt outreach, particularly to the young voters who overwhelmingly favor Mr. Sanders.For now, Mr. Sanders is doing nothing to endear the front-runner to his supporters. ""There are many people, including my opponent, who want you to think kind of small,"" he said at a recent campaign stop.Marcus Johnson, 24, one of about 10,000 people who came to hear Mr. Sanders speak at Michigan State University last week, said he would never vote for Mrs. Clinton and would consider backing the Green Party candidate.""Honestly, I think she's a Republican,"" he said.Others are open to supporting her, though some say unenthusiastically.""It would be a definite vote against the GOP and not for Hillary,"" said Harriet Scureman, 71, of Norwalk, Conn.On the other hand, Katherine Steinfield, 22, a senior at Michigan State who prefers Mr. Sanders, said Mrs. Clinton, as a woman, has had to overcome obstacles that Mr. Sanders never faced. ""I think she's impressive, too,"" she said.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",4/27/16
Election 2016: Clinton and Sanders Clash --- Sparks fly over auto bailout and trade at seventh Democratic presidential debate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770825947?accountid=12768,"FLINT, Mich. -- The Democratic presidential contenders clashed over economic policy in a debate Sunday, with front-runner Hillary Clinton attacking rival Bernie Sanders for his opposition to a federal auto bailout and Mr. Sanders charging that Clinton-backed trade deals had helped destroy American cities like Detroit.Both issues resonate deeply in Michigan, which holds a primary election Tuesday. The state is home to auto makers that benefited from a 2009 government bailout, but it also has lost jobs to trade as companies moved positions overseas.It was their seventh debate, and the sharpest clash yet, with the candidates repeatedly interrupting and accusing each other of hypocrisy. Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates, even after weekend caucus wins for Mr. Sanders in Nebraska, Kansas and Maine. Mrs. Clinton won Saturday's Louisiana primary, which had the biggest delegate count.Asked about a possible future confrontation with Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Mrs. Clinton predicted that his ""bigotry, his bullying, his bluster are not going to wear well on the American people.""The Vermont senator stayed on offense. He blasted Mrs. Clinton's record, demanded she release transcripts of her Wall Street speeches and sharply critiqued her husband's record as president in the 1990s.Mr. Sanders has been attacking Mrs. Clinton over trade, but Mrs. Clinton's hit on the auto bailout was a new and potent counter. Federal assistance for the industry was included in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion measure that was credited with keeping the nation's financial system from collapsing. The Senate vote to release the second half of those funds came in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration.""The money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry,"" said Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator. ""I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money.""Mr. Sanders defended his vote, saying he objected to the Wall Street bailout money. He said he wasn't willing to give taxpayer money to those companies due to what he called their own recklessness, greed and illegal behavior. ""Let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street,"" he said. ""I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street.""Within minutes, the Sanders campaign sought to soften and clarify his position. Mr. Sanders supported the auto funds but not the Wall Street rescue, it said. Since they couldn't be separated, he opposed the bill.Mrs. Clinton said the exchange proved her point that Mr. Sanders is a ""one-issue candidate."" Mr. Sanders didn't disagree, but said his ""one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class.""Mr. Sanders attacked Mrs. Clinton's support for some free-trade agreements, such as Nafta, which eased trade rules with Mexico and other nations and was signed by former President Bill Clinton and backed by Mrs. Clinton when she was first lady. ""You didn't need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour,"" he said. He also criticized welfare reform and Wall Street deregulation legislation that he signed.In each case, Mrs. Clinton replied that ""if we're going to argue about the 1990s,"" then she preferred to talk about that era's robust job creation and broadly rising incomes.Mrs. Clinton went after Mr. Sanders for opposing reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which provides financial support to help U.S. companies export their goods. Mr. Sanders called the entire enterprise ""corporate welfare.""The debate was staged in Flint, a venue pushed by Mrs. Clinton to bring attention to a crisis that was triggered by a cost-cutting move that elevated the lead level in the city's water supply.Mr. Sanders repeated his call for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to resign, and for the first time, Mrs. Clinton agreed and added that if he doesn't resign, he should be recalled.In a series of tweets sent during the debate, Mr. Snyder defended his record and said he is taking responsibility for the Flint crisis.The pair also returned to one of their longtime disputes -- Mr. Sanders's backing of a 2005 law that provided gun makers legal immunity. In January, Mr. Sanders voiced support for legislation that would remove gun manufacturers' protections from liability. On Sunday, though, Mr. Sanders offered a more nuanced view, suggesting gun makers shouldn't be held responsible for actions of those who legally purchase firearms.Credit: By Laura Meckler, Colleen McCain Nelson and Rebecca Ballhaus",4/27/16
"Election 2016: Sanders, Clinton Spar on Trade in Midwest --- Senator attacks Nafta and Pacific deal, and front-runner promises job-creation policies",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175569?accountid=12768,"EAST LANSING, Mich. -- Trade and manufacturing took center stage as the Democratic presidential race moved to Michigan on Thursday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders talking up his longtime opposition to free trade agreements and Hillary Clinton's campaign promising policies that would support job creation.Mr. Sanders, looking for a win in the industrial heartland, repeated his claim that Mrs. Clinton had supported ""disastrous"" trade agreements and suggested that her opposition to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership wasn't sincere.The former secretary of state plans to respond in a speech at an auto supplier in Detroiton Friday. Advisers said that Mrs. Clinton would propose ways to create jobs by boosting manufacturing, and that she was willing to back trade agreements only if they met her standards.""The answer can't be to shut down all trade,"" said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton's senior policy adviser. He said the key is backing ""smart and fair trade, where American workers get a level playing field with the rest of the world.""The candidates have been debating these points for months, but the issues are taking on new urgency with the approach of Tuesday's primary in Michigan, a state long reliant on manufacturing that has suffered steep job losses.The issue is sure to be litigated when Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton debate on Sunday in Flint, Mich.Mr. Sanders is banking on a win in Michigan for fresh momentum after losing seven of the 11 states that voted on Tuesday and falling well behind in the delegate count. His top aides refer to the Michigan contest as a ""showdown"" that will influence the course of the race.On Thursday, Mr. Sanders fired the first salvo. At a news conference here, surrounded by union workers, he said he had consistently opposed trade deals and suggested that Mrs. Clinton can't be trusted to stop them if elected president.Mr. Sanders said that trade agreements such as Nafta, signed by Mrs. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, have eliminated jobs in the U.S. as corporations have moved operations to countries that pay lower wages.He rattled off various trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton backed and that he had opposed. ""On the issue of trade, Secretary Clinton's views and mine are very different,"" Mr. Sanders said.He also pointed to Mrs. Clinton's original kind words for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation deal that is one of the Obama administration's key priorities. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton called it the ""gold standard,"" but she came out against it once it was completed in October, six months into her presidential campaign.""She was very reluctant to come out in opposition,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""She is running for president. She concluded it was a good idea to oppose the TPP, and she did.""The Sanders campaign also is airing a TV ad in Michigan that says Mr. Sanders has been steadfast in opposing trade deals ""while others waffle.""Mrs. Clinton has said she evaluates trade agreements on a case-by-case basis, supporting some but not others. As a senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton opposed a Central American Free Trade Agreement but supported deals with Australia, Singapore and several other nations.Mr. Sullivan didn't answer directly when asked whether, if elected president, Mrs. Clinton would try to make changes to the Asian deal to get it approved. He said that she believes ""we need to have a very serious conversation about the future of trade."" He said that should include how to prevent a ""race to the bottom"" among trading partners, and that Mrs. Clinton wants a ""hard think"" about what it would take to construct trade agreements that raise working standards.Clinton aides said that in her Friday speech, she would present a broad vision for bolstering U.S. jobs. Mr. Sullivan said she would lay out a ""new bargain for a new economy"" that extends to coal country and cities such as Detroit.She has already laid out several small-scale proposals for bolstering manufacturing, including tax breaks to encourage investment in hard-hit areas and better enforcement of trade agreements.Mr. Sullivan charged that Mr. Sanders didn't have a manufacturing plan of his own, and said he was wrong to oppose reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which provides financing to support some major domestic manufacturers. On that issue, Mr. Sanders aligned with conservatives in opposing what he called ""corporate welfare to multinational corporations.""The Clinton campaign also called in backing from Michigan's Sen. Debbie Stabenow. The senator said that Mrs. Clinton ""totally gets it"" when it comes to manufacturing and jobs. ""You don't have an economy, you don't have a middle class, unless somebody makes something,"" she said.Credit: By Laura Meckler By Peter Nicholas",4/27/16

He took issue with many of the criticisms leveled by Republicans and Wall Street bankers--as well as Democratic presidential hopeful Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders--against the Dodd-Frank overhaul law.""It is true that we have not dismantled the financial system, and in that sense, Bernie Sanders's critique is correct,"" Mr. Obama said of Mr. Sanders's plan to break up the biggest banks . ""But one of the things that I've consistently tried to remind myself during the course of my presidency is that the economy is not an abstraction. It's not something that you can just redesign and break up and put back together again without consequences.""Criticism from members of the financial industry is also unreasonable, Mr. Obama said. He dismissed their complaints about economic policies, saying: ""That's not rooted in anything they're experiencing, it has to do with ideology and their aggravations about higher taxes.""Still, the president continued to cast a skeptical eye toward the financial services industry, saying it ""absorbs more resources and, maybe most importantly, more talent than I would like to see."" He added he would prefer that those who have math skills enter the fields of sciences or engineering rather than ""trying to build algorithms to beat the market and to work arbitrage.""Mr. Obama's allies also resolutely defended his economic legacy. Former National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said the economic recovery had been ""beyond anybody's wildest expectations."" Former House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D., Mass.) lamented that ""you get no credit for disaster averted or damage minimized."" He joked that ""things would have sucked worse without me"" wasn't a ""very salable message,"" even if it accurately reflected Mr. Obama's record.Still, Mr. Obama seemed confident history would show his administration, as well as that of President George W. Bush, had acted quickly and correctly to rescue the economy from worse calamity during the height of the crisis.""One day we're saving the banks; the next day we're saving the auto industry; the next day we're trying to see whether we can have some impact on the housing market,"" he said. ""We were moving so fast early on that we couldn't take victory laps.""Write to Gabriel T. Rubin at gabriel.rubin@wsj.comCredit: By Gabriel T. Rubin",4/28/16
"Clinton Counts on Others to Unite Party; Support for likely nominee rests on moves by Obama, Trump and Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784665868?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--With her party's presidential nomination in sight, Hillary Clinton began wooing Bernie Sanders supporters to her campaign in earnest Tuesday night. But in the weeks to come, she will rely on others to finish much of the work of uniting Democrats behind her if she is the nominee.The effort begins with Mrs. Clinton, who devoted a large chunk of her victory speech Tuesday to an explanation of what unites Democrats after months of talk about their divisions. But Mrs. Clinton and her staff are walking a narrow path: They want to welcome Sanders supporters without looking like they are trying to drive the Vermont senator out of the race before he is ready to go. At the same time, the Clinton campaign is eager to turn its attention to the general election.Interviews with Clinton campaign officials and other senior Democrats suggest three people in particular are likely to hold the key to uniting Democrats: Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Mr. Sanders.Barack Obama: The president remains enormously popular inside the Democratic Party, had considered making an endorsement during the primaries--presumably for Mrs. Clinton--but he held off once it became apparent that she would be able to win without him.That neutrality may give him particular credibility if and when he moves to unite Democrats around a nominee, and Clinton allies say he will be critical, particularly with young people who have flocked to Mr. Sanders's side and are essential for the future of the Democratic Party.Tom Nides, who was a top deputy to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department and is now a senior executive at Morgan Stanley, said that with Mr. Obama's active support, Mrs. Clinton could reach Obama-level support from young voters, despite her poor showing with them during the primaries.""Barack Obama will be the unifying voice,"" he said.The president appears up for the challenge. ""My most important role,"" he said last month, ""will be to make sure that after primaries [are] done I'm bringing everybody together so that we focus on winning the general election.""A handful of other popular Democrats also could be helpful, notably Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who haven't made endorsements.Donald Trump: Many Democrats predict that if he is the Republican nominee, he will serve as the great unifier. They argue that no Democrat, including supporters of Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, could favor Mr. Trump, who has insulted women, Muslims, Mexicans, the disabled and others. On Tuesday night, the Clinton campaign quickly cut a video highlighting Mr. Trump's comment at a news conference the same night that Mrs. Clinton wouldn't get 5% of the vote if she were a man.""We're facing one of the greatest unifying forces in American politics. His name is Donald Trump,"" said Democratic consultant Chris Kofinis, who is unaffiliated in the primary. ""That's how we'll come together.""Mr. Trump will be particularly helpful in driving young people to Mrs. Clinton, said John Della Volpe, who studies young voters at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. His polling finds that Mrs. Clinton is seen unfavorably by 53% of voters aged 18 to 29; Mr. Trump is seen unfavorably by 74% of those voters.Mr. Della Volpe said Mr. Trump ""has completely washed away"" the opportunity for Republicans to make inroads with young voters in this election.Bernie Sanders: Mrs. Clinton spoke passionately during a town-hall-style event on MSNBC this week about how she expects Mr. Sanders to bring his supporters around to her, just as she worked to bring her supporters around to Mr. Obama after he won their 2008 nomination contest.Clinton aides like to quote Mr. Sanders's oft-made promise to do whatever he can to keep a Republican from winning the White House. But Mr. Sanders has sent mixed signals about his level of support. On MSNBC, he said that Mrs. Clinton needs to earn his supporters by adopting all sorts of some positions she doesn't hold, such as imposing a carbon tax and backing a single-payer health program. On Tuesday night, after it was clear he had won just one of five states in the Northeastern primaries, he issued a statement in which he promised to continue to fight for progressive causes.""This campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton's top advisers and many others in the party say her biggest mistake would be trying to push him out of the race before he is ready.""Sanders should stay in the race until the end. He has earned that right and his supporters in the remaining states deserve the opportunity to vote for him,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior aide during both of Mr. Obama's presidential campaigns.But, Mr. Pfeiffer said, pushing his campaign to the convention if she has the nomination wrapped up makes no sense. ""That would be pointless and dishonest to his supporters, as well as a great gift to Donald Trump,"" he said.Credit: By Laura Meckler",4/28/16
"Hillary's Debt to Sanders and Trump; Next to her rivals' gloomy rhetoric about America the bleak, she almost looks like a beacon of hope.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784311583?accountid=12768,"Even before the air-clearing April 19 New York primary in which Bernie Sanders was trounced and Donald Trump was a big winner, word had come of a more presidential Trump soon to be revealed. The unveiling came with Mr. Trump's victory speech, an event that occasioned near-universal excitement when the candidate used the word ""senator"" in front of Ted Cruz's name--a reaction that said a good deal about Mr. Trump and his campaign, all of it deeply familiar.Mr. Trump's image refurbishing promises to become a show all its own, fascinating to behold, albeit with slim prospects of success. The same would be true for Bernie Sanders, also being pressed now to improve his tone--the nudging being another of the many things the two have in common in addition to the main thing, namely the enormous role both have played in advancing Hillary Clinton's progress toward the White House.Mr. Sanders is being urged, in the interest of Democratic unity, to temper his assaults on Hillary Clinton as a pawn of Wall Street and servant of special interests--no easy matter for a lifelong ideologue of the far left. But no accusation transmits more of a sense of high moral indignation than the regular reminders that Mrs. Clinton voted for the Iraq war in 2002 and that he did not--a fact Mr. Sanders cites, by way of response, when facing questions about his qualifications for the presidency as compared with those of Mrs. Clinton.To hear him again and again on Sen. Clinton's war vote is to be struck by the unvarying intensity Mr. Sanders brings to the charge, the tone of a man delivering a bombshell, and one, for him, that never loses its power. His capacity to stay on message to the exclusion of all other concerns has been conspicuous throughout his campaign.When news came in November that the topics for the Des Moines, Iowa, debate among the Democratic contenders would be reordered to include national security and terrorism, no one was taken aback. No one that is but the Sanders campaign, which made bitter protest to CBS, the debate host, over this sudden change in the agreed-on lineup of subjects.The other two scheduled debaters, including Martin O'Malley, had no complaints. The broadcast would take place one night after the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris in which 130 people had been killed and hundreds wounded. It was inconceivable that a nationally televised presidential debate would fail to include a focus on this latest rampage of horror. For Mr. Sanders and his team, the Paris attacks were in the way, an expenditure of time and attention that cut into his opportunity to hold forth on the guiding principles of his campaign.The debate opened on the subject of Paris, with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O'Malley contributing detailed commentaries. Mr. Sanders declared that he was shocked and disgusted by the attacks, and that the world must be rid of ISIS--observations he immediately followed with the announcement that he was running for president: ""because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people and what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.""Mr. Sanders then contributed his now well-known belief that the greatest threat to national security is climate change--this along with several reminders that he had voted against the war in Iraq. The war, he declared, was responsible for the rise in terrorism.Was he, debate moderator John Dickerson wanted to know, actually now making a direct link between Mrs. Clinton's vote for the Iraq war and what was happening with ISIS, with terrorism? Mr. Sanders's reply left no doubt that this was exactly his view.In the days before the New York primary, crowds of Sanders supporters gathered in Manhattan's Washington Square Park. They were young, overwhelmingly white, trapped in a solid claustrophobic mass stretching for blocks, and happy to be there. They were largely college and high-school students, members of his most visible and devoted constituency.In an era when the young emerge from years of schooling that portrays the U.S. as the world's leading threat to peace and justice in the world--as a militarist aggressor awash in racism, in a system run by and for Wall Street--the Sanders campaign was a magnet. Long instructed in the progressive faith that is now established religion on the nation's campuses, they found in Mr. Sanders's politics, and his view of American society, a confirmation of all they have been taught.It becomes clearer as the Sanders and Trump campaigns roll on how great the similarity is in the picture of America conjured by those two visionaries--an image of America the bleak, a broken society, weak, lost, oppressed by the weight of injustice and losing everywhere in the world, as Mr. Trump reports.The two have in common, as well, their conspicuous resistance to all questions, all requests for some fragment of information on the specifics of their planned goals: to make America great again, folks (Mr. Trump's trope), and a future we can believe in (Mr. Sanders's).Nothing was clearer in Mr. Sanders's now famous April 1 meeting with the editorial board of the New York Daily News than that the last thing he expected to be demanded of a candidate representing so advanced a commitment to social justice was some acquaintance with facts, or specifics as to how one might go about the goal, say, of breaking up the big banks. Mr. Sanders's wife would later tell a CNN interviewer that this meeting, with its questions, was akin to ""an inquisition.""Hillary Clinton's high negatives in the polls notwithstanding, the difference between her level of knowledge, command of policy and experience compared with these two others is unlikely to be lost on Americans who have these many months witnessed the total absence of any such qualification in either her Democratic primary opponent, or the man who may well become the nominee of the Republican Party. That is just one of the reasons Mrs. Clinton would have for gratitude if Mr. Trump is in fact the nominee.There is another reason that may well be more important. After long months of rage-mongering, the politics of gloom and the images of a broken America conjured by both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton looks, by comparison, like a model of hope and shining optimism--no small claim, given those negatives. And no small advantage, either.Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of the Journal's editorial board.Credit: By Dorothy Rabinowitz",4/28/16
Election 2016: Sanders Targets Superdelegates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776772781?accountid=12768,"If you lose a state but never really tried to win it, should it count as a loss?The Bernie Sanders campaign, trailing Hillary Clinton in delegates, is trotting out alternatives for scoring the race for the Democratic nomination. Don't focus so much on the states Mr. Sanders largely ceded to the former secretary of state; look at the states where he fought hard, his aides are saying.By that standard, the Sanders team believes he is doing much better than the delegate count would suggest. As it stands now, Mrs. Clinton is leading in pledged delegates, 1,243 to 980. When superdelegates are thrown in, her lead grows to 1,712 to 1,011.Recognizing that Mrs. Clinton had huge advantages in Southern states on Super Tuesday, March 1, the Sanders campaign says it largely wrote them off. Instead, the campaign focused its energies on more promising states -- Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma, among them -- in hopes of notching some victories and showing Mrs. Clinton was beatable.""Those eight states where we didn't compete on Super Tuesday have resulted in almost all of her pledged delegate advantage right now,"" Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine told reporters this week in a conference call.When Mr. Sanders competes with her head-to-head, he does better, Mr. Devine said. ""We have a very good chance of beating her in every single place where we compete with her,"" he said.A problem with that argument is that the race comes down to who has the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, not who scored the most impressive or surprising wins.But Sanders advisers hope their reasoning will make an impression on superdelegates: the party leaders and elected officials who are free to support whomever they choose. The idea is if Mr. Sanders can spread doubt among superdelegates about Mrs. Clinton's electability and persuade them he is the one with the momentum, then perhaps they'll abandon Mrs. Clinton.Sanders supporters are frustrated by the delegate math. Having come from nowhere, Mr. Sanders is now on a roll. He won landslide victories last week in Hawaii, Washington and Alaska. Next week is the Wisconsin primary, and the Clinton campaign seems to be bracing for another loss. Mrs. Clinton flew home from Wisconsin on Tuesday night to campaign in New York.But unless Mrs. Clinton loses handily in some of the delegate-rich states coming up -- New York, California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- she'll remain on a glide path to the nomination.Eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton found herself in the same position as Mr. Sanders. Powered by huge support among black voters, then-Sen. Barack Obama rolled up a lead that he never relinquished. Much like the Sanders campaign is doing now, the Clinton campaign in 2008 questioned Mr. Obama's electability and made the case to superdelegates that she was the safer bet.Still, the Clinton campaign is having none of Mr. Sanders's argument. After the Sanders campaign conference call, Clinton aide Jesse Ferguson tweeted: ""Summary of Sanders spin today: Voters only count for real or mean anything when they vote for Sanders.""Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/28/16
"Election 2016: Sanders Wins Big, Still Faces Uphill Climb --- Vermont senator is far behind Clinton in Democratic delegates after caucus victories",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776032746?accountid=12768,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's resounding victories in three weekend caucuses gave his campaign a much-needed boost but did little to slow Hillary Clinton's march to the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.His wins in the Washington, Alaska and Hawaii caucuses, coupled with his strong fundraising, strengthen Mr. Sanders's argument for remaining in the Democratic race.But his path to the nomination remains contingent on big victories in the roughly two dozen states and territories that have yet to vote -- and on persuading roughly 500 party officials and activists known as superdelegates to abandon Mrs. Clinton and back him at the July convention in Philadelphia.""We think we do have a path toward victory,"" Mr. Sanders said Sunday on CNN. ""We've won the last five out of six contests, all of them in landslide victories. What we have said from day one is the South is the most conservative part of America. We did not do well there. . . We're out of the South, we're heading to the West Coast which is the most progressive part of America. We think we're going to do very well there.""The Sanders campaign acknowledges that it is fighting an uphill battle, but Mr. Sanders cited his momentum in arguing that ""a lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position.""The campaign moves on to Wisconsin next. Mrs. Clinton announced Saturday she would campaign in Madison, Milwaukee, La Crosse and Green Bay in advance of that state's April 5 primary. Mr. Sanders has campaign stops scheduled in Appleton, Milwaukee, Kenosha and La Crosse this week.After Wisconsin, the next big contest is in late April in New York, a delegate-rich state that carries symbolic meaning for both campaigns. Mrs. Clinton represented the state in the Senate between 2001 and 2009 and has based her campaign there. Mr. Sanders was born in Brooklyn and makes frequent references to his childhood upbringing.In Alaska, Mr. Sanders beat Mrs. Clinton by 64 percentage points, in Washington by 46 points, and in Hawaii by 40.Mrs. Clinton didn't campaign heavily in the three states, expecting that Mr. Sanders would win. In the run-up to the contest in Alaska, she called into a radio station and recalled a period after college when she briefly worked at a fish cannery in the state.Mrs. Clinton has built her delegate lead on nonwhite and older voters, winning in states across the South where black voters make up a significant proportion of the electorate. Though Mr. Sanders trails in delegates the map is potentially friendlier for him in April and May when a number of northeastern states head to the polls.Mr. Sanders won at least 55 of the delegates at stake on Saturday, while Mrs. Clinton won at least 20. That means he still trails Mrs. Clinton 1,004 delegates to 1,712 delegates, including superdelegates, according to the Associated Press.Mr. Sanders entered March trailing Mrs. Clinton by fewer than 30 delegates after their virtual tie in Iowa and his victory in New Hampshire. But in the March 1 contests, Mr. Sanders won only 347 of the delegates while Mrs. Clinton picked up 518. She swept all five states on March 15 -- Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio -- and added to her delegate lead.Democrats award delegates in all contests on a proportional basis. Mr. Sanders would need to win almost two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates to clinch the nomination.After a busy March, the pace of contests in April and May slows down significantly.After Wisconsin, Wyoming will hold a caucus on April 9. New York's primary is April 19, while Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island hold Democratic contests on April 26.Mr. Sanders is expected to be competitive in many of those races. His campaign won victories in northeastern states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, plus Michigan.---Ben Leubsdorf contributed to this article.Credit: By Byron Tau",4/28/16
Election 2016: Clinton Challenges the Gun Lobby --- Taking on the NRA marks stark contrast with prior campaign and rival Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772050407?accountid=12768,"DURHAM, N.C. -- Hillary Clinton is making gun violence a central theme of her campaign, becoming the first leading presidential candidate to directly confront the National Rifle Association without the cover of a hunting license.She is holding town halls with a group known as the Mothers of the Movement, composed of mothers of victims of ""gun violence, police and racially charged incidents,"" including Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager fatally shot by a white neighborhood-watch volunteer in 2012.In Ohio, six leaders of the group, all of whom lost children in high-profile shootings or police altercations, are set to campaign on her behalf again this weekend, ahead of Tuesday's Democratic primary.""She's the only candidate trying to do something about gun violence,"" said Gwen Carr, whose son, Eric Garner, died in New York in police custody in 2014.The former secretary of state's confrontational stance toward the NRA is a shift from her first presidential run, and it could encourage candidates running for Congress or state legislative positions to follow.In 2008, she tried to ease gun owners' concerns by associating with them, much as her male counterparts have done in the past. While the men often talked about hunting trips or posed in camouflage, Mrs. Clinton shared her memories of learning to shoot a gun when she was a child.Mrs. Clinton's calculation is that attitudes toward expanded background checks and new regulation of gun-show sales have changed enough in the aftermath of a succession of mass shootings to lower the political risks.Yet her positions are already drawing the ire of the NRA, an organization with more than five million single-issue voters who are renowned for punishing politicians who cross them -- including presidential candidates.""She lies about the issue in a way to make it seem reasonable, to really advance a radical gun-control agenda,"" said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker, who accused Mrs. Clinton of oversimplifying a complex set of laws and exploiting victims of gun violence.If Mrs. Clinton wins the nomination, the showdown over guns could influence the outcome in several critical swing states won by President Barack Obama in 2012 that also have pro-gun constituencies, including Colorado, New Hampshire and Virginia.Mrs. Clinton talks up the fact that she is challenging the gun lobby in her stump speech. ""It is time, my friends, we stand together and say enough,"" she said. ""I stand with the families of Sandy Hook,"" she added, referring to the 2012 school shooting in Newton, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults.Registered voters overall are more concerned the government would go too far in restricting gun rights, at 52%, than fail to do enough to regulate access to firearms, at 44%, a December Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found. But the survey also showed a deep partisan divide, with 74% of Democratic primary voters saying they were worried government would do too little, and 73% of Republicans worried it would do too much.That partisan edge makes the issue a useful foil in Mrs. Clinton's primary battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has tried both distancing himself from and explaining his own record on guns, which includes voting to prevent gun makers from being held liable for products they sell.Mr. Sanders, who represents a pro-gun state and who only recently became a Democrat, has highlighted his ""D- minus"" rating with the NRA in some debates. In a March 6 debate in Michigan, he took a different tack, casting his vote in free-market, economic terms.""If they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you are really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America,"" Mr. Sanders said.His response prompted an NRA tweet saying he was ""spot-on"" in his argument.The Sanders campaign didn't immediately respond to request for comment.Crimes involving guns have been trending down for years, yet highly publicized mass killings are on the rise.A Federal Bureau of Investigation study found an average of 16.4 active-shooter incidents a year between 2007 and 2013, up from an average of 6.4 a year from 2000 to 2006.---Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Credit: By Valerie Bauerlein",4/28/16
Sanders Campaign Cuts Staff After Losing Four States; Reduction of hundreds of workers comes after Hillary Clinton's primary victories on Tuesday,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784617157?accountid=12768,"The Bernie Sanders campaign is laying off hundreds of field staffers after a tough stretch in which he lost five of the last six nominating contests and now has virtually no chance of mounting a comeback to wrest the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton.Though Mr. Sanders has surpassed fundraising expectations, the campaign doesn't have ""unlimited resources"" and cannot afford to keep on the payroll a full complement of field staff with three-quarters of the Democratic contests completed, a person familiar with the matter said.Mr. Sanders still has staff deployed in states that vote over the next two months, including more than 40 in the biggest prize on the calendar, California. But his campaign will finish out the race with a leaner team, this person said.Before the Iowa caucuses in February, Mr. Sanders's staff totaled more than 1,000, the campaign said Wednesday. Staff size fluctuates continually, but with the cutbacks the Sanders team will number 325 to 350, the campaign said.""We no longer require many of the loyal and dedicated state and national support staffers who helped us in places...where the nominating contests have been completed,"" campaign spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement Wednesday.The Clinton campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The Sanders campaign has raised money at a fast clip but also spent significant sums. In March, the campaign spent $46 million, compared with about $28 million by Mrs. Clinton.The Sanders team is reassessing its prospects after losses Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Delaware. As recently as mid-April, Sanders aides believed the Vermont senator still had a chance to erase Mrs. Clinton's lead in pledged delegates. They no longer believe that is the case.An Associated Press tally shows Mrs. Clinton leading by 333 pledged delegates. With the addition of superdelegates--party delegates and elected officials that declared their support--she has 2,151 delegates; Mr. Sanders has 1,338. Backing from 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination.""We all recognize the degree of difficulty has increased with the results,'' Tad Devine, a senior Sanders strategist, said of Tuesday's elections. ""But we're pretty set on the course here. He'll be in this thing, and we believe we can narrow the gap in pledged delegates significantly. But I'm not going to confidently predict we will surpass her.""What hopes Mr. Sanders has of capturing the nomination rest on persuading hundreds of superdelegates backing Mrs. Clinton that they should abandon her on the argument that he would make the stronger general election candidate, Sanders advisers said.Mr. Sanders seemed to be addressing superdelegates at a rally Wednesday in West Lafayette, Ind. ""We are in this campaign to win and become the Democratic nominee,"" he said. ""If we want a candidate who will be the strongest to defeat [Donald] Trump or any other Republican nominee, you're looking at that candidate.""As its prospects dim, the Sanders campaign is focusing on the platform Democrats will adopt at their nominating convention in July. Sanders advisers hope the success they have had against Mrs. Clinton will provide leverage in shaping a platform that reflects some of Mr. Sanders's policy aims.Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser, said the campaign understands that winning the nomination may be impossible but is pressing forward in hopes of winning delegates and influence at the convention. He predicted that Mr. Sanders would win most of the 14 remaining contests, providing a jolt of momentum that could help usher in a ""different kind of Democratic Party that's much more populist and less corporate.""He said Mr. Sanders would take a range of demands to the convention. Those include rules changes that would diminish the role of superdelegates, such as making them nonvoting participants in the convention, and pushing for open primaries that allow independents to participate. Mr. Sanders has performed best in contests in which independents are free to take part.Mr. Cohen said Mr. Sanders would also press for Democrats to swear off super PAC funding in primaries and for reinstatement of the Democratic National Committee's ban on accepting contributions from lobbyists.It isn't clear that Mrs. Clinton will go along. At a recent televised town hall meeting, she noted that she's in the stronger negotiating position by virtue of her lead.Hilary Rosen, a Clinton supporter who has worked on past Democratic conventions, said she doesn't anticipate big fights at the convention.""There might be a few points of contention for the platform. But I think what Sanders and his people will find in Hillary Clinton is an open mind, a commitment to progressive values, combined with a desire to win in November,"" she said.Ben Kesling contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",4/29/16
The Trump-Sanders China Syndrome,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776590872?accountid=12768,"Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, with a phalanx of lawmakers behind them, continue to bash China as a ""currency manipulator."" Both men claim that Beijing is engaged in a permanent strategy to keep the yuan weak and prop up its trade surplus. But the reality was never that simple, and the charge is ludicrous at present.Beijing began pegging its currency to the U.S. dollar over two decades ago, as part of its plan to integrate the Chinese economy into a global marketplace in which transactions were overwhelmingly priced in dollars. It stuck by this strategy even during the height of the Asian financial crisis, in 1998, when much of the world was expecting it to devalue. This earned it great praise from the U.S. government. ""China, by maintaining its exchange rate policy,"" pronounced President Clinton's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, ""has been an important island of stability in a turbulent region.""But once market pressures reversed, and capital began flowing into China, U.S. lawmakers suddenly decided that currency stability was bad: They wanted the yuan to rise, while China continued to keep it fixed. In a 2006 op-ed for this newspaper, Sens. Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham declared that ""one of the fundamental tenets of free trade is that currencies should float."" Such a tenet, remarkably, was unknown to either Adam Smith or John Maynard Keynes, neither of whom ever supported any such thing.Fast forward to 2016, and capital is now flowing out of China at a prodigious rate. In an effort to slow the resulting fall in its currency, China's central bank has been selling vast amounts of dollars and buying up yuan. At $3.2 trillion, China's reserves still seem enormous. But they are down $790 billion from their 2014 peak, and $325 billion in the past four months.At this pace of decline, China's reserves will fall to $2.8 trillion in July. To put this in perspective, China, using the International Monetary Fund's framework for reserve-adequacy measurement, needs to hold between $2.8 trillion and $4.2 trillion in reserves to safeguard against a balance-of-payments crisis. Once reserves fall below an adequate precautionary level, China is at risk of being unable to pay for essential imports or its dollar debts. The IMF estimate could be overly cautious, given China's relatively low level of external debt, but it could also be too sanguine in that some significant portion of China's reserves, estimated to be around a third, is believed to be tied up in nonliquid assets -- and unavailable in a crisis. These include China's capital commitment to the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.So what can China do to stanch the rapid decline in reserves?The country has for years been pursuing what has been called the ""Impossible Trinity"": controlling interest and exchange rates while leaving the capital account significantly open. Chinese residents are permitted to send up to $50,000 overseas annually and this is enough to allow trillions in outflows. China could impose tighter capital controls to prevent this, as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda recently urged it to do. This would allow it to operate safely with fewer reserves. The adequate level of precautionary reserves falls to between $1.7 trillion and $2.6 trillion when adjusted for capital controls. But this would put a halt to China's plans to transform the yuan into a major reserve currency -- something it will be reluctant to do.China could also raise interest rates, which might encourage capital inflows and discourage outflows, but this would hurt growth in an already sinking economy.Finally, China could let the exchange rate fall significantly, but this would increase the debt burden on Chinese companies. Outstanding dollar credit to Chinese nonfinancial companies is estimated to be around $1 trillion. Too great a fall in the yuan, coupled with slowing economic growth, could precipitate a corporate solvency crisis.That China has no good options, and only a choice among painful ones, reflects the underlying structural problem in the Chinese economy -- one that will take many years to fix. The economy was tooled to support grossly overoptimistic expectations of foreign demand for Chinese exports. Retooling it to encourage domestic demand will require time and a willingness by the Chinese government to allow businesses to die so that more promising ones may live.It also shows that American charges that China's currency was massively undervalued were based on the flawed assumption that capital would want, indefinitely, only to get into China and not out. It's a sure bet no one in Washington will be calling for China to float its currency again anytime soon.---Mr. Steil is director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of ""The Battle of Bretton Woods"" (Princeton University Press, 2013).

"Hillary & Bernie, Tax Fantasists",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776257420?accountid=12768,"Here is a question to ask Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders: What is the best tax rate to impose on high-income earners to ensure there is enough government revenue to pay for your trillion-dollar promises to voters?Perhaps they think it is 83%, a rate that economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez hypothesized in 2014 in a widely circulated paper. Or maybe it is 90%, which Sen. Sanders told CNBC last May was not out of the question. ""Our job is not to think small,"" Mr. Sanders elaborated in the Huffington Post a month later. ""It is to think big.""Progressives have often reminded us that the U.S. had such rates in the past. From 1936 to 1980, the highest federal income-tax rate was never below 70%, and the top rate exceeded 90% from 1951 to 1963. Under Ronald Reagan, the top federal rate declined to 28% by 1988 and has never reached 40% since.The discussion of these rates can easily create the impression that the federal government collected far more money from ""the rich"" before the Reagan administration. And it can also leave another impression: There would be no downside to raising rates to 1950s levels, given that decade's prosperity.Neither impression would be correct. The effective tax rates actually paid by the highest income earners during the 1950s and early '60s were far lower than the highest marginal rates. Few taxpayers reached the top brackets, the code was rife with loopholes, and capital gains were taxed at much lower rates.In the 1960s, for example, the average rate paid by the top 0.1% of tax filers -- the top 10th of the top 1% -- ranged from 26.5% to 29.5%, according to a 2007 study by Messrs. Piketty and Saez. Even during the 20 years after the Reagan tax cuts, the top 10th of the top 1% paid an average rate of 23.7% to 33% -- essentially the same as in the 1960s. In the decade following 2001, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the average rate for this elite group never exceeded 32%.Nostalgia aside for a world that never existed, few people paid the top tax rates of the 1950s and early 1960s. Of course, when they did, the top marginal rates applied only to income above a very high threshold. The top ordinary income rate married couples faced in 1960, 91%, applied only to income above $2.5 million in today's dollars.Suppose a President Clinton or Sanders tried to raise effective tax rates paid by a significant number of upper-income earners through very high top rates. What then? Real damage, according to Mr. Piketty. In a 2009 debate with the Cato Institute's Chris Edwards in the Economist, Mr. Piketty said, ""I firmly believe, that imposing a 70% or 80% marginal rate on large segments of the population (say, 25% of the population, or even 10%, or even a few percentage points) would lead to an economic disaster."" In other words, sayonara increased tax revenue.Even without disaster, however, it is unclear whether higher rates on the upper echelons of the top 1% would bring in more revenue. I've compared the Piketty-Saez estimates of average federal income-tax rates paid by the top 10th of the top 1% with the revenue collected at the federal level from the same group. The result? From the mid-1960s through the '80s, trends in the average tax rates paid at the top compared with their tax revenues are mirror images. When average tax rates went up from 27.6% in 1965 to 34% in 1975, revenues went down, from 0.6% to 0.5% of the sum of GDP plus capital gains. When average tax rates declined to 23.7% over the second half of the 1970s and the '80s, tax revenues from the top went up, reaching 0.8% of GDP plus capital gains in 1990.This makes intuitive sense. Of all Americans, it is the wealthy who are more likely to take advantage of legal ways to reduce their payments when rates rise. Plus, their work and investment decisions are more sensitive to the after-tax payoff.Admittedly, in the early 1990s, Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton raised average tax rates at the top, and revenue from the top 0.1% eventually skyrocketed. But the flood of revenue overwhelmingly reflected not the increase in rates but the stock market's takeoff beginning in late 1994, which resulted in a corresponding rise in income from capital gains and stock options.Consider: If the higher top tax rates had caused the growth in revenue, then revenues should have fallen when Mr. Clinton cut the top tax rate on capital gains to 20% from 28% in 1997. But revenues from the top 0.1% kept pouring in.Proposals to soak the rich by raising their tax rates are unlikely to yield the revenue windfall that Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton are dangling before voters. Leveling with the American people means either scaling back their agendas or admitting that they will have to raise the money from tax hikes on middle-class voters.---Mr. Winship is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.Credit: By Scott Winship",4/29/16
Sanders Gets No Respect,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776145112?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders won three Western Democratic caucuses by landslides on Saturday, and all he got was this lousy Associated Press headline: ""Sanders wins 3 states; Clinton holds delegate lead."" The AP header is accurate, but the Vermont Senator and his legions can be forgiven for wondering what he has to do to get some political respect.Mr. Sanders won Alaska with about 82% of the vote, Hawaii with 70% and delegate-rich Washington state with 73%. These may not be bellwether states. But Donald Trump or Ted Cruz would love to have those margins, and in a normal year a front-runner like Hillary Clinton would be running up such totals at this stage of the presidential race. Instead the 74-year-old Mr. Sanders is showing the kind of electoral strength that gives him every right to fight on at least through April's contests and maybe to the convention in July.The challenger's victories reveal Mrs. Clinton's continuing weakness even among Democratic partisans. On Tuesday Mr. Sanders won in Utah and Idaho, while the former Secretary of State won easily in Arizona. She continues to have a delegate lead thanks to her victories in states dominated by older African-American voters and government-employee unions. But she inspires little enthusiasm, and the case for her seems to boil down to her inevitability as the nominee and that her political experience and stolidity are antidotes to the likely GOP nominee, Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders is also fighting the perception that as an avowed socialist he can't win in November. ""Don't let anybody tell you that Hillary Clinton is the strongest Democratic candidate to take on the Republicans,"" Mr. Sanders told an estimated crowd of 15,000 in the People's Republic of Seattle. ""It is not true.""The current head-to-head polls bear him out. In the Real Clear Politics polling average, Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump by 17.5 points and Mr. Cruz by 8.4. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump by 11.2 and Mr. Cruz by only 2.9. Mr. Sanders is tied with John Kasich, while Mrs. Clinton loses to the Ohio Governor by 6.5 points.Most Americans still don't know much about what Mr. Sanders believes, including his desire to return to 1930s tax rates and his sympathy for Communist regimes during the Cold War. His belief in undiluted socialism would be vetted in a general election campaign in a way it hasn't been in the Democratic primaries.Then again, Mrs. Clinton has helped to validate many of those positions by moving so far left herself. And in Mr. Trump the Republicans may nominate a candidate who is building negative approval ratings that no candidate has been able to recover from and win the White House.Mrs. Clinton remains the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, not least because of her lead in ""superdelegates."" These are current or former elected officials and other Democratic grandees who are formally unpledged to any candidate before the convention. AP currently has them going 469 for Mrs. Clinton and only 29 for Mr. Sanders.For all the talk about an open convention that could deny Mr. Trump the GOP nomination, the Democratic establishment has done far more to rig the nominating process to favor elites. One reason Mr. Sanders gets no respect is because Democratic elites prefer a nominee who disguises her socialism better than he does.",4/29/16
Four Questions for Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785452964?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders isn't quitting the race, but his advisers are hinting that the nomination fight is effectively over. Coming off a series of losses, they acknowledge that Mr. Sanders can't erase Hillary Clinton's lead in pledged delegates in the 14 contests that remain.What that means is that the only way for Mr. Sanders to win is to persuade hundreds of Democratic insiders known as superdelegates to abandon Mrs. Clinton and line up behind the candidate who has criticized the party establishment on and off for decades--a scenario that isn't likely.As the race reaches the endgame, a few questions arise about a Sanders campaign that exceeded expectations but is on a path to fall short.1. Why did Mr. Sanders take the Clinton email issue off the table?The Vermont senator boxed himself in when he told Mrs. Clinton at the first debate in October that Americans were ""sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.""Mrs. Clinton exclusively used a private account and server during her tenure as secretary of state. In relying on that system, she ran the risk of exposing sensitive classified material and complicated public-records requests.In February, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled that top aides to Mrs. Clinton could be questioned under oath about whether they deliberately skirted public-records laws by making use of the private email system. ""This case is about the public's right to know,"" the judge said.Mr. Sanders has questioned Mrs. Clinton's judgment and integrity when it comes to other matters. He faulted her for taking money from Wall Street, including large speaking fees.If he sees the Wall Street speeches as fair game, why put the email controversy off limits?2. Why did he wait so long to build ties to African-American voters?If Mrs. Clinton clinches the Democratic nomination, a key reason is the African-American vote. She built her delegate lead on the loyalty of black voters.Mr. Sanders comes from a state with few black voters and seems to have done little in his political career to forge the sorts of relationships in the black community that would prove valuable in a presidential race. That project needed to begin years ago--not in the heat of a race against Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders has spent the past few months scrambling to make the case to African-American voters that he would be a reliable ally in the White House. It hasn't helped. Exit polls show he has gotten crushed by Mrs. Clinton among black voters. Mr. Sanders made some of his most aggressive moves to court black voters during the New York primary fight; Mrs. Clinton won New York and beat him among black voters by 50 points.3. Why did he wait so long to build ties to Democrats?Mr. Sanders spent decades as an independent. Not until he entered the presidential race last year did he declare himself a Democrat.That is an unconventional path for someone who wants to lead the party. And Mr. Sanders is now paying a price. Superdelegates are party leaders and past and present elected officials who get an outsize say in picking the Democratic nominee. They are backing Mrs. Clinton by 520 to 39, according to an Associated Press tally.As a lawmaker Mr. Sanders has consistently voted with the Democrats and has supported Democratic candidates running for office. But he has never been a creature of the party.""Party politics has not been central to our lives, that's true,"" Jane Sanders, the candidate's wife, said in an interview.What seems clear is Mr. Sanders never thought he would be in this position: running a competitive race against the Clinton juggernaut. Had he foreseen where his political career was headed, he might have been helped by joining the Democrats sooner and wooing the officials who wield so much influence.4. Why did he write off the South?The Sanders campaign made an early strategic decision that haunts the candidate to this day. Rather than focus on winning delegates in the early going, Mr. Sanders sought to capture some marquee states and demonstrate Mrs. Clinton was beatable.Trouble is, delegates determine the winner--not states. Sanders aides acknowledge they put up little fight in a slew of Southern states with large black populations.So, Mrs. Clinton won landslide victories in Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Louisiana and elsewhere. Under Democratic rules that award delegates proportionally, she built up a large lead that Mr. Sanders is unlikely to overcome.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/30/16
Hillary Clinton Says Donald Trump Wouldn't Win Over Bernie Sanders Backers; The Democratic front-runner says she wouldn't back down from a focus on women's issues,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785394016?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton flatly dismissed Donald Trump's suggestion that he can win over supporters of rival Bernie Sanders in the fall election, arguing that the Republican's views on a range of issues would repel them.In an interview Friday with CNN, Mrs. Clinton also said she wouldn't back down from her focus on women's issues, and professed little concern about Mr. Trump's assertion that she wouldn't win 5% of the vote if she weren't a woman.""If playing the 'women's card' means standing up for the concerns that women have and that they express to me, then deal me in,"" she said, using what has become a signature phrase for her campaign. ""Because that's exactly what I've always done for decades [and] what I will do in this campaign.""She also cited her two successful elections to the U.S. Senate and the many votes she has received in the 2008 and 2016 presidential elections. ""So it doesn't really square with reality,"" she said. His attacks are ""kind of silly,"" she said, saying she is more bothered by his attacks on other groups.Mr. Trump set off the latest back-and-forth on Tuesday after both he and Mrs. Clinton had strong showings in the East Coast primaries. ""Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5% of the vote. The only thing she's got going is the woman's card,"" he said. That prompted days of mocking by the Clinton campaign and its supporters. Mr. Trump stuck with the attack, saying that Mrs. Clinton couldn't run for ""city council"" without the ""woman's card.""Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders share some views--such as opposition to free-trade agreements--and have both challenged their respective political establishments. Mr. Trump has suggested that he could win over some of the Sanders backers if Mr. Sanders loses the Democratic nomination.Mrs. Clinton dismissed that idea. She cited climate change, the minimum wage and equitable pay for women as issues where Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are at odds and called the Republican front-runner's foreign policy views ""reckless, loose, dangerous.""""I don't think that's very appealing"" to Sanders backers, she said. ""I'm going to be very aggressive in...reaching out to Sen. Sanders's supporters, but we have so much more in common. And we have far more in common than they do with Donald Trump or any Republican.""Asked about insults Mr. Trump had delivered to her, Mrs. Clinton said in the CNN interview, ""I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak."" An aide said she was referring to past GOP opponents. ""I'm not going to deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me,"" she said.After his losses on Tuesday in four out of five states , Mr. Sanders suggested he was staying in the contest in hopes of influencing the Democratic Party's platform on key issues. Mrs. Clinton suggested there may be room for discussion.""We're gonna talk. We're gonna work together. Because, look, we want the same goals,"" she said. ""We really are going to be unified and have a tremendous progressive agenda to run on in the fall. And I really think that will help us win the election and it will also help us govern.""Mrs. Clinton also spoke about understanding how hard it is to lose a contest like this. Back in the 2008 Democratic race, she didn't concede the nomination to then-Sen. Barack Obama until June.""You throw yourself into these campaigns body and soul. You work 24/7. Your family, your supporters, everybody is so invested in trying to win,"" she said. But she said that in 2008, she was closer to Mr. Obama than Mr. Sanders is to her in both total votes and delegates. ""There comes a time when you have to look at the reality,"" she said.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler",4/30/16
Sanders Renews His Push for More Superdelegates; Democratic candidate acknowledges he faces 'uphill climb' to overtake Clinton for presidential nomination,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785716609?accountid=12768,"Trailing Hillary Clinton and with time running out, Bernie Sanders said Sunday he can still win the Democratic presidential nomination, though he conceded he faces an ""uphill climb"" that involves persuading hundreds of party insiders known as superdelegates to switch sides and support his candidacy.Speaking on the first anniversary of entering the primary race, Mr. Sanders said the superdelegates, who play a role in picking the Democratic nominee, should consider polls showing him to be the stronger general-election candidate against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. He added that superdelegates living in states he won decisively should respect the voters' preferences and back him.Mr. Sanders indicated he isn't about to bow to calls for party unity and stand aside while his rival gets the nomination, noting that Mrs. Clinton likely would need superdelegates to help her clinch the nomination.With Mr. Sanders competing with her to win superdelegates, he said the nominating convention in Philadelphia in July will be a ""contested"" one.But the focus on superdelegates underscores Mr. Sanders's predicament. He ran as an outsider determined to usher in ""political revolution"" and repudiate ""establishment politics."" Now he is pinning his hopes on the prospect that superdelegates--party leaders and elected officials--will abandon Mrs. Clinton in numbers that would hand him the nomination. ""Nothing I'm telling you today suggests this is going to be an easy climb,"" Mr. Sanders said.After the news conference in Washington, one of his senior advisers, Tad Devine, was asked if the Sanders strategy was ""strange"" given his anti-Establishment message. ""Can I use 'ironic' instead of 'strange?' "" Mr. Devine replied.The campaign's search for superdelegates reflects the hard realities of delegate math. After winning five of the last six states, Mrs. Clinton pushed an already commanding lead to 327 pledged delegates, the kind selected by voters.By the Sanders campaign's calculations, he would need to win 65% of the pledged delegates to close the gap in the 14 contests that are left. While not ""impossible,"" Mr. Sanders said, ""that is, admittedly, and I do not deny it for a second, a tough road to climb...""Superdelegates are free to back whomever they choose. They now support Mrs. Clinton by a margin of 520-39, according to an Associated Press tally.Many are siding with Mrs. Clinton, even though Mr. Sanders won their states by large margins. He cited some examples. Despite winning the caucuses in Washington state with 73% of the vote, Mr. Sanders is backed by none of the state's superdelegates, he said. Instead, 10 superdelegates in Washington favor Mrs. Clinton.For some superdelegates, that argument falls flat. They say they have larger responsibilities to the party and country and shouldn't be bound by how their states voted.Billi Gosh is a superdelegate from Mr. Sanders's home state of Vermont, where he beat Mrs. Clinton by 74 percentage points. Ms. Gosh is backing Mrs. Clinton, pointing to reasons that center on credentials.""I'm voting for the person who, (a), I think will win and (b), who is the most qualified and will be an outstanding president,"" Ms. Gosh said.

Bernie Sanders won Indiana's primary Tuesday , giving his flagging presidential campaign ammunition to press forward and making plain front-runner Hillary Clinton's persistent trouble unifying the Democratic Party.With 80% of precincts reporting, Mr. Sanders had 53% to Mrs. Clinton's 47%, according to the Associated Press.Even with the win, Mr. Sanders still faces a wide deficit in convention delegates and virtually no chance to close the gap. He picked up at least 43 of the 83 pledged delegates at stake, but Mrs. Clinton took at least 37, according to an AP tally.Still, the late-in-the-game win by the Vermont senator creates an odd split-screen for the Democrats, with the Clinton campaign increasingly focused on Republican Donald Trump even as Mr. Sanders lays bare her weakness with a large slice of Democrats. Exit polls showed he again beat her among young people, white voters, political independents and people who most value honesty in a candidate.The senator's win in Indiana may make it more awkward for Mrs. Clinton to look past him, as she did this week. Confident in her delegate lead , she spent much of Tuesday campaigning in the fall battleground state of Ohio. Her campaign in recent days began hiring staff across states expected to be competitive this fall, and her advisers were in the early stages of a vice-presidential selection process.Speaking Tuesday evening in Louisville, Ky., before the results were announced, Mr. Sanders noted how far his campaign has come since its early days a year ago and highlighted his strong support with young voters.""That is important because it tells me that the ideas that we are fighting for are the ideas of the future of America,"" he said.The speech showed Mr. Sanders in no mood for party unification, as some Democrats would like. He hit Mrs. Clinton on her paid speeches to Wall Street, her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her support for a $12-an-hour--but not $15--federal minimum wage, which he thundered was ""not good enough!""This month is likely to bring Mr. Sanders additional wins in a string of primaries in Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon and Kentucky.

Hillary Clinton Is Taking Fire From Two Rivals; Democrat is trying to turn her focus to Donald Trump but has yet to fend off Bernie Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786691052?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton is now fighting a two-front war for the presidency, facing an emboldened, combative Donald Trump while fending off Bernie Sanders, who promises to take his campaign all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July.Mr. Trump, by contrast, has cleared the Republican field and can direct his firepower at Mrs. Clinton alone. He signaled Wednesday that he would pick up Mr. Sanders's line of attack against the Democratic front-runner.""Bernie actually said she's unqualified because she's got bad judgment, and it's true,"" Mr. Trump told Time magazine.Mrs. Clinton is also attacking Mr. Trump on a daily basis, and Wednesday she told CNN the U.S. can't afford to take a risk on a ""blustering, bullying guy."" ""He is a loose cannon, and loose cannons tend to misfire,"" she added.The landscape has shifted beneath Mrs. Clinton. For months, it seemed as if Republicans were headed for a messy, contested summer convention, while Democrats would unify behind the front-runner. Mr. Trump still faces an insurgency within his party, with many Republicans vowing they would never support him, but Mrs. Clinton is the one with a persistent primary foe drawing support from a large chunk of the party.Democrats say they are confident that the party will rally around Mrs. Clinton, partly in response to the prospect of a Trump presidency. Mrs. Clinton holds a nearly insurmountable delegate lead. She lost to Mr. Sanders on Tuesday in Indiana , but the victory cut Mrs. Clinton's lead by only six delegates. Three other contests this month favor Mr. Sanders, but they also are unlikely to eat meaningfully into her lead among pledged delegates , which now stands at 321.Nonetheless, victory emboldened the Vermont senator, and he went after Mrs. Clinton directly at a rally Tuesday night. His aides said Wednesday that the aggressive posture would continue at least through the last primary in June and that Mr. Trump's emergence as the presumptive Republican nominee changes nothing. ""Full steam ahead, absolutely,"" said Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver.On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders challenged Mrs. Clinton to another debate, in California, which votes on June 7, something Mrs. Clinton had agreed to in February. A Clinton aide declined to comment on the prospect.The Sanders campaign says it will fight to wrest the nomination away from Mrs. Clinton. While lagging behind in pledged delegates, those chosen by voters, he is even farther behind Mrs. Clinton among superdelegates, party leaders who can vote for whomever they like. His strategy is to win over the superdelegates by arguing he would be the stronger general-election candidate.It is a difficult case to make. Mr. Sanders is asking party leaders--the establishment that he rails against in every speech--to overturn the will of Democratic voters, who have cast more votes for Mrs. Clinton than for him. Since Mr. Sanders announced this approach nearly two months ago, not a single superdelegate has switched sides.Either way, Mr. Sanders plans to press for a range of liberal policy issues at the party convention in Philadelphia in July. That means that, at minimum, the Clinton forces will face a strong push for policies that she has already rejected, such as a Medicare-style health-care plan for all, a carbon tax and a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage.Ben Wikler, Washington director for liberal group MoveOn.org, said his members would back Mr. Sanders's push for the party to adopt ""the most progressive platform ever"" and characterized the coming debate as a ""fight for the soul"" of the party. But he said MoveOn opposes any effort to have superdelegates overturn the pledged delegates.Others in the party are eager for Mr. Sanders to let up.""It's time for Sen. Sanders to tone it down and stop criticizing her....It's no longer at all helpful, and I'd argue that it's problematic,"" Steve Elmendorf, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns who backs Mrs. Clinton, said Wednesday. ""People are going to start telling him that.""Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic pollster, added that Mr. Sanders's continued criticism wouldn't change the course of the Democratic campaign, ""but it does give Trump fodder for ads and attacks.""For its part, the Clinton campaign has turned its attention almost completely to the general election. Mrs. Clinton is traveling to states with Democratic contests to make clear she will ""honor the primary"" process, and she believes Mr. Sanders should stay in the race as long as he likes, an aide said. But the campaign isn't spending money on TV ads in these states. It has started hiring staff for general-election battleground states, and Mrs. Clinton this week campaigned in Ohio, which is likely to be closely contested this fall. Her advisers are in the early stages of a vice-presidential selection process.Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday she would focus on explaining what she would do as president and would press Mr. Trump to do the same.""At some point when you're running for president, you actually have to put a little meat on the bones,"" she told CNN. ""You've got to tell people what it is you're going to do and how you're going do it.""With fewer reporters covering Mr. Sanders's events, and the public increasingly focused on the general election, Clinton aides don't appear particularly concerned about the persistent Sanders attacks.Rather, they say Mr. Trump's ascendance will help unify Democrats around her, and Wednesday morning the campaign emailed supporters with an anti-Trump message. ""This is really happening,"" it read. ""Trump is going to be the Republican nominee.""William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in Bill Clinton's White House, said he doesn't see any contradiction between Mrs. Clinton's campaigning against both Messrs. Sanders and Trump at the same time. He pointed to 2008, when Mrs. Clinton campaigned through the last Democratic primary against then-Sen. Barack Obama, and Sen. John McCain already had clinched the Republican nomination.""Hillary Clinton is hardly the first candidate to find herself fighting a two-front war,"" he said. ""My sense is that she will be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",5/5/16
Election 2016: Key Test for Sanders Looms,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777414317?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- A New York primary that once looked like a sure thing for Hillary Clinton looms as a pivotal showdown in the Democratic presidential race, with rival Bernie Sanders hoping to embarrass her in her adopted state with a strong showing that would raise doubts about her electability.Both campaigns see New York as a prize with one of two potential outcomes: A Clinton victory that deprives Mr. Sanders of one of his best remaining chances to cut into her delegate lead, or a Sanders upset that would advance his argument to superdelegates that she is a risky bet in the general election.With 247 delegates up for grabs, New York carries the largest cache of the convention representatives of any state left on the calendar save for California. Mrs. Clinton now leads in pledged delegates by 1,243 to 980. If Mr. Sanders can't come out New York with a heavy majority of the state's delegates, the race effectively would be over, Clinton aides said.""There's very little evidence to date of their ability to win the big, diverse states like New York by the type of margin they would truly need to overcome the delegate edge,"" said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.Mindful of the stakes, each candidate figures to compete ahead of the April 19 contest in New York with an intensity not seen since Iowa and New Hampshire. Though the Wisconsin primary is Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton peeled away from the Badger State for three straight days of campaigning in New York that will culminate Friday with a pair of campaign stops in Syracuse.Her campaign rolled out a new 30-second TV spot that will air in New York and her husband on Thursday held several rallies in Manhattan. Earlier in the week, Bill Clinton took part in private meetings with African-American and Hispanic leaders who could help boost turnout in minority neighborhoods that favor Mrs. Clinton.One attendee was Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. In an interview, Mr. Diaz said the meeting with a small group of elected officials and business leaders covered both policy and political strategy. ""They're taking New York state seriously. They're not taking anything for granted,"" he said.Both candidates boast ties to the state that they will highlight in the run-up to the vote. Mrs. Clinton represented New York for eight years in the Senate and owns a home in Chappaqua; Mr. Sanders grew up in the state.At a rally Thursday at the State University of New York at Purchase, in the same county as her home, Mrs. Clinton, said: ""It is so good to be home.. . .Westchester is more than a county to me. It's a community where Bill and Chelsea and I moved back in 1999,"" she said, rattling off some local restaurants she enjoys.At the university event, she had a brief, tense conversation with a Greenpeace activist on the rope line who asked about contributions she's gotten from the fossil fuel industry. Mrs. Clinton, pointing her finger at the woman, said: ""I am so sick, I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about this.""""I was honestly surprised by her reaction today. I wasn't expecting that,"" said 26-year-old Eva Resnick-Day, who said neither she nor Greenpeace has any affiliation with the Sanders campaign.Appearing in Harlem on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton showcased her ties to New York officials. She was accompanied at a stop at a cake shop by Rep. Charlie Rangel, who took aim at Mr. Sanders in a conversation with reporters. He congratulated the Vermont senator on making income inequality a priority.""Now I need some help as to what else he's made a priority,"" Mr. Rangel said.Mr. Sanders was raised in a 3<frac12> room apartment in Brooklyn and despite having lived in Vermont for decades he has retained his New York accent. His campaign is planning events that will highlight his origins, including trips to his old neighborhood and even the running tracks where he competed as a high school athlete in the 1950s.""It's going to be difficult for us to win in her home state. But that's what we're going to try to do,"" said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders strategist. ""And I do think that if we can find a way to defeat her it would be a gigantic signal that Hillary Clinton is a weak front-runner.""A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday showed Mrs. Clinton beating Mr. Sanders in the state 54% to 42%. Still, the poll offered some hopeful news for the Vermont senator: New Yorkers seem to like him better.A total of 49% had an unfavorable view of Mrs. Clinton, compared with 45% who viewed her favorably. For Mr. Sanders, 54% had a favorable view, versus only 30% who had a negative opinion of him.---Colleen McCain Nelson and Thomas MacMillan contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Erica Orden",5/5/16

An analysis of the presidential candidates' social-media followers shows who they are reaching, and suggests how social media could be helping -- or hurting -- the contenders.Businessman Donald Trump has the largest social-media following of the presidential candidates. An analysis by social-media data company Captiv8 of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram followers of the candidates shows that Sen. Bernie Sanders has a strong following from young people, while Republican candidates tend to have more followers over age 30.Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's corps of followers is evenly split between men and women, and her most-engaged followers are 25-34 years old. Of Mr. Trump's most-engaged followers, by comparison, 62% are male and 38% are female, and his most-engaged followers are 30-39 years old. Most-engaged is defined as followers that have liked, commented, shared or retweeted a candidates's social posts.Captiv8 uses image recognition, and links social-media accounts to determine age, gender and location information. The firm says its analysis has a 88%-90% accuracy rate. Captiv8 doesn't track private accounts.Some of Instagram's most-followed accounts, including singers Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus, are following Mrs. Clinton. These so-called ""influencers"" can help Mrs. Clinton spread her message and draw new followers to her account, says Captiv8 founder Krishna Subramanian.Ms. Perry's 44.4 million followers and Ms. Cyrus's 39.8 million followers are king-size compared with the former secretary of state's one million.(See accompanying chart -- WSJ Apr. 1, 2016)Credit: By Natalie Andrews",5/5/16

Bernie Sanders Criticizes Atlantic City's Casino Industry; The Democratic presidential candidate brings campaign to New Jersey ahead of June primary,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787548184?accountid=12768,"ATLANTIC CITY--Sen.

Sanders Cash Keeps Flowing --- Senator's $44 million haul from donors in March ensures race will continue for months,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778075783?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to rake in contributions for his presidential run despite remaining a clear underdog in the race for the Democratic nomination, all but ensuring his battle with Hillary Clinton will continue for months.Mr. Sanders's latest fundraising haul -- $44 million in March -- was amassed as his path to the nomination narrowed substantially, leaving him with a daunting deficit in convention delegates. Such a feat amounts to defying political gravity, campaign-finance experts say: When candidates start losing primaries, as Mr. Sanders did during the first half of the month, the flow of donations typically slows significantly.But Mr. Sanders's fundraising has continued apace, fueled largely by small-dollar online donors. Now, after wins in a string of Western states in late March, the Vermont senator hits April with both money and fresh momentum. He holds a narrow lead over Mrs. Clinton for Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls, and the New York primary two weeks later looms as a pivotal showdown.The importance of the New York contest for both campaigns is evident in the haggling this past weekend over where and when the candidates might debate ahead of the April 19 vote.Mr. Sanders's fundraising totals have grown each month this year, hitting $21.3 million in January and $43.5 million in February. Mrs. Clinton hasn't yet released her take from last month, but Mr. Sanders raised more than her in January and February.Although Mr. Sanders has won five of the past six contests, Mrs. Clinton still holds a commanding lead in delegates that her campaign argues is nearly insurmountable. Mr. Sanders now needs decisive victories in delegate-rich states such as New York, California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to make up ground, and he may also need to convince party officials known as ""superdelegates"" to abandon Mrs. Clinton and support him. Absent those outcomes, Mrs. Clinton appears likely to emerge as the Democratic nominee, but Mr. Sanders could make that an expensive proposition.Mr. Sanders ""is not suffering the fate that candidates usually suffer when they're running behind,"" said Lawrence Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a group that aims to reduce the influence of money in politics. ""The narrative that it's impossible to beat Hillary Clinton has not stopped [Sanders supporters] because I don't think they believe it,"" Mr. Noble said.In interviews, many Sanders supporters said they were motivated by the senator's pledges to address income inequality and overhaul the campaign-finance system, and they plan to continue lending financial support until the end. Only 3% of Mr. Sanders's fundraising total has come from donors who have given the legal maximum of $2,700, and many backers have signed up to automatically contribute a modest sum each month.Aislinn Melchior, a professor from Tacoma, Wash., who has made several small contributions, said of Mr. Sanders: ""I am willing to do whatever I can to help out his candidacy, even if it's doomed.""Kenneth Pennington, digital director for the Sanders campaign, said the senator's supporters understand that building a grass-roots movement doesn't happen overnight.""They're in this fight for the long haul,"" he said. ""That means when we win, our supporters respond in large numbers. When we lose, our supporters step up to help us win in the long run.""With contributions pouring in, Mr. Sanders can afford to match Mrs. Clinton dollar for dollar, forcing the former New York senator and secretary of state to continue to spend heavily on a primary campaign just as she hoped to be pivoting to the general election.Anthony Corrado Jr., professor of government at Colby College in Maine, said it is virtually unprecedented for a candidate who is trailing in the polls this late in the primary season to continue to raise funds at this rate.""This is usually the point where you see all the money break toward the front-runner,"" he said.Perhaps more notable is the fact that Mr. Sanders has built a fundraising juggernaut with a record-setting share of small donations, Mr. Corrado said.President Barack Obama set the high-water marks for attracting small-dollar contributions in 2008 and again in 2012, but Mr. Sanders has raised more money from small donors at this point in the campaign than any previous candidate in history, he said.At the end of February, 56% of Mr. Sanders's fundraising had come from individuals who had contributed a total of $200 or less, Mr. Corrado said. Only 21% of Mrs. Clinton's haul through February came from donors who contributed $200 or less, he said. At the same point in the 2008 cycle, Mr. Obama had raised 28% of his total from those small donors.Clinton campaign officials have said that early in the year, many of their supporters didn't view this as a competitive race or feel a sense of urgency. Josh Schwerin, a Clinton spokesman, said a recent surge in contributions put the campaign over the one-million-donor mark a few weeks ago. Sanders campaign officials said they have received contributions from about two million donors.""We've seen tremendous growth in our online grass-roots fundraising over the past few months, with more than half the money we raised in February and March coming in online,"" Mr. Schwerin said.Despite an increase in online donations, Mrs. Clinton continues to devote a substantial amount of time to closed-door fundraisers, events that take her off the campaign trail. During the past week, she attended a fundraiser in New Jersey, two in Massachusetts, two in New York and another in Illinois.Meantime, more than 94% of Mr. Sanders's fundraising has been done online. For Team Sanders, the key number is $27 -- the oft-repeated figure that represents the average contribution to his campaign.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",5/9/16
Election 2016: Tempers Flare as Key Contests Loom --- Democratic feuding escalates; Sanders advisers demand apology from Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777698964?accountid=12768,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Feuding between Hillary Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, escalated to new levels this past week, with the Vermont senator's campaign advisers demanding she apologize for saying they were ""lying"" about money she has gotten from the oil and gas industry.Campaigning nonstop, both candidates are showing flashes of fatigue and impatience as the race barrels toward a series of key contests later this month in the delegate-rich states of New York and Pennsylvania. The sour tone could make it more difficult for the party to unify after the race is settled. A Wall Street Journal-NBC poll last month showed one-third of Sanders supporters can't see themselves voting for Mrs. Clinton in the fall if she becomes the nominee.Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates, but she has lost five of the past six contests, and her campaign concedes she will be hard-pressed to win Wisconsin, where the primary is Tuesday. She is heading back there Saturday after three days of campaigning in New York. Fearing Wisconsin might be a lost cause, her staff once had considered making no more trips to the state and instead focusing on coming contests.An indication of the contest's current tenor came at what began as a routine a campaign stop in Purchase, N.Y., on Thursday that ultimately produced one of the tensest moments Mrs. Clinton has had on the trail.A group of Sanders supporters interrupted her speech, chanting, ""If she wins, we lose."" As they walked out, Mrs. Clinton said: ""The Bernie people came to say that. We're very sorry you're leaving.""Later, on the rope line, a Greenpeace organizer asked about her campaign contributions from the fossil-fuel industry. Mrs. Clinton shook her finger at the woman, 26-year-old Eva Resnick-Day, and angrily said: ""I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about that. I'm sick of it.""Ms. Resnick-Day said in an interview she was surprised by Mrs. Clinton's retort. In past encounters with Greenpeace activists, Mrs. Clinton has been cordial in discussing her record, Ms. Resnick-Day said.A Clinton senior adviser, Jennifer Palmieri, said Mrs. Clinton was annoyed because she believed her record had been distorted. She has long supported renewable energy and is not beholden to the fossil-fuels industry, she said.""Does it annoy her when people misrepresent her record? It does. And that's what you saw"" on the rope line, Ms. Palmieri said.Steve Schmidt, a senior strategist in Republican John McCain's 2008 presidential bid, described Mrs. Clinton's reaction as the sort of ""tell"" one sees in a poker game -- a reflection of Mrs. Clinton's frustration that Mr. Sanders is hanging on.""What it shows is Bernie Sanders is getting under her skin,"" Mr. Schmidt said.Republicans circulated the video in hopes that it would produce a backlash that damages Mrs. Clinton.""The finger in the face, hammering away with it, is not a good look, usually, in politics,"" said Bill Cunningham, a political consultant who has worked for Republicans and Democrats alike.Yet the incident also provided a rare window into the emotions of Mrs. Clinton, who seldom veers off script and has faced criticism for lacking authenticity. Some voters might sympathize with her for a human reaction to what she saw as an unfair attack, other analysts said.Democratic political consultant Steve McMahon, who isn't aligned in the race, said the exchange would only humanize Mrs. Clinton.""If you believe your opponent is lying about your record consistently and maliciously, this kind of a reaction is perfectly understandable and perfectly natural,"" he said.Clinton aides say what money the campaign has gotten from oil and gas interests is largely coming from workers who happen to like the former secretary of state. Employees in the oil and gas industry have donated $307,561 to the Clinton campaign, of a total of $160 million she has raised to date, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.The industry has given an additional $25,701 to outside groups backing the campaign, which have raised more than $55 million on her behalf. And registered lobbyists with clients in the oil and gas industry have raised more than $600,000.Mr. Sanders's campaign has received $53,760 from oil and gas industry employees.The oil and gas industry is far from Mrs. Clinton's largest backer. Wall Street, for example, has given more than $21 million to her campaign and outside groups supporting her.No apology from the Clinton campaign appears in the works. ""Apologize for what? No."" Ms. Palmieri said.---Erica Orden and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",5/9/16

"Hillary Clinton Is Forced to Keep Fighting for Votes; Facing defeat in West Virginia on Tuesday, Democratic presidential front-runner's supporters press Bernie Sanders to stand down",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787614498?accountid=12768,"Although she retains an overwhelming lead in the Democratic presidential contest, Hillary Clinton is expected to fall short in the West Virginia primary Tuesday and could come out of May with a three-state losing streak.Democrats who support her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, show no sign that they are prepared to abandon him in deference to Mrs. Clinton's status as the all-but-certain nominee.Polling shows Mr. Sanders with a small lead in West Virginia, and even Mrs. Clinton has conceded that her chances are ""pretty difficult"" in one of the nation's least racially diverse states. In many cases, Mrs. Clinton has struggled in states where a large share of residents are white.In West Virginia, she also has been hurt by recent comments that were viewed as anti-coal.Mr. Sanders also is poised for strong showings on May 17 in Kentucky and Oregon, states with comparatively few of the minority voters who have proved loyal to Mrs. Clinton in prior contests. That Mr. Sanders is still winning states at this late stage in the Democratic fight points to persistent divisions within the party as Mrs. Clinton closes in on the nomination.The former secretary of state has 2,228 delegates, about 94% of the total needed to clinch the nomination. Mr. Sanders has 1,454 delegates.Republicans also vote tomorrow in West Virginia, as well as in Nebraska, though billionaire Donald Trump is the only remaining competitive candidate.In the Democratic race, allies of Mrs. Clinton say they would like to see Mr. Sanders accept the inevitable and drop out, allowing Mrs. Clinton to focus her fire and campaign resources on Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders has said he is determined to give his supporters a chance to vote for him until the final contest on June 14. His campaign also hopes to maximize his delegate total so that he has more clout in shaping the Democratic platform at the party's convention in Philadelphia in July.""Look, if you asked what is the best thing for the party, it would be to just get this thing wrapped up and focus on Donald Trump,"" said James Carville, a senior adviser in Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential election victory.With Mr. Sanders in the race, Mrs. Clinton is compelled to spend money and time on the primaries.Losing states is ""more than embarrassing--it's absolutely injurious to her political fortunes,"" said Doug Schoen, a pollster who has advised Bill Clinton.Mr. Sanders ""hurts her ability to solidify the party and to raise money and to campaign effectively against Donald Trump. All of those are very, very bad,"" Mr. Schoen said.For Mrs. Clinton, the costs of the prolonged Democratic race are growing more evident. On Wednesday, she is scheduled to make a campaign stop in New Jersey, whose primary is set for June 7.New Jersey is a solid blue state in presidential elections, having voted for the Democratic nominee since 1992. From the standpoint of winning a general election, it would be more useful for Mrs. Clinton to spend time in traditional battleground states, one of her campaign fundraisers said Monday.Similarly, Mrs. Clinton spent $2.7 million on campaign ads in Pennsylvania prior to the April 26 primary. She didn't want to risk losing the state to Mr. Sanders, who spent $4 million on ads in Pennsylvania.Mrs. Clinton wound up winning the state, but if she had no competition in Pennsylvania, the front-runner could have saved the money for the general election.In her 2008 presidential bid against then-Sen. Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton stayed in the race until June. So, she risks sounding unfair if she calls on Mr. Sanders to drop out. But she is edging closer to the line. In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS, she seemed to be urging him to reconsider and step aside.""I see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party,"" she said, ""to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share.""Should Mr. Sanders stay in the race, some of her allies want to see him spare Mrs. Clinton and exclusively target Mr. Trump.Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",5/10/16
Bernie Sanders Wins West Virginia Democratic Primary; Win gives Sanders a boost as campaign heads to states on West Coast,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787861078?accountid=12768,"MARTINSBURG, W.Va.--Bernie Sanders defeated front-runner Hillary Clinton in West Virginia on Tuesday, regaining momentum and leaving some of Mrs. Clinton's backers uneasy that her path to the Democratic presidential nomination figures to be rocky to the end.""I'm always uncomfortable when she loses,"" said New Hampshire state Sen. Lou D'Allesandro, a Clinton supporter. ""Every time [Mr. Sanders] presents himself and presents his story, more people start talking about him. And that goes on and on.""Related* In Break From Tradition, Trump Won't Release Taxes Before Election* Polls Show Tight Races in Key Swing States, Warning Signs for Clinton* Clinton Says She's Weighing Medicare for 50-Year-Olds* Ryan, Trump to Discuss How to Unify GOP* Trump's Chief Fundraiser Is an Unorthodox Choice* Trump Narrows VP List; Marco Rubio Not InterestedOn the Republican side, presumptive nominee Donald Trump easily won primaries in West Virginia and Nebraska.The New York businessman no longer has any opposition, having cleared the once-crowded GOP field. Still, he continues to campaign in primary states, pursuing the magic number of 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the party nomination.Mr. Trump spent the weekend stumping in West Virginia and Nebraska. He also appeared in the next two states on the GOP calendar, Oregon and Washington.Mr. Trump has set his gaze on the general election in the fall, setting up a fundraising team and tapping New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to lead the transition should he be elected president.A Sanders victory of any size in West Virginia wouldn't dislodge Mrs. Clinton from her commanding position in a primary fight that has outlasted the Republican contest. West Virginia offers only 29 Democratic delegates and, under party rules that award them on a proportional basis, Mrs. Clinton was unlikely to come away empty-handed.May 10 Primary ResultsBut polls suggest Mr. Sanders could notch wins next week in Oregon and Kentucky, demonstrating that a sizable wing of the party remains attracted to his populist message and isn't yet ready to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton.Victories also tend to fuel Mr. Sanders's fundraising, giving him more money to air TV ads and prolong the fight.Mr. D'Allesandro, the New Hampshire lawmaker, said he has written emails to the Clinton campaign asking that they compete more aggressively in upcoming contests. ""You want to enter the convention with the best possible wind at your back.""At this stage in the contest, the delegate math remains decisively in Mrs. Clinton's favor. She led Mr. Sanders by 290 pledged delegates heading into the West Virginia primary. With superdelegates thrown in, her lead stood at 2,228 to 1,454. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination. Superdelegates are elected officials and party leaders who can vote for whichever candidate they prefer.Mr. Sanders reiterated in a statement Tuesday night that he intends to stay in the race: ""We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination, and we're going to stay in the race until the last vote is cast.""He added: ""We fully acknowledge we have an uphill climb ahead of us, but we're used to that. We have been fighting uphill from the day this campaign began.""Mrs. Clinton is likely to have a better month in June, when large, diverse states such as California and New Jersey hold primaries. She has fared better in states with large concentrations of minority voters.But until she clinches the nomination, she is forced to spend money and time on the primary race, lest she endure more potentially embarrassing defeats.Losses to Mr. Sanders are ""absolutely injurious to her political fortunes,"" said Doug Schoen, a pollster who has advised Bill Clinton. ""He hurts her ability to solidify the party and to raise money and to campaign effectively against Donald Trump.""One of Mrs. Clinton's top advisers suggested her campaign isn't going to waste resources and is aware that the central battle is the showdown with Mr. Trump.""You finish out the primaries, and you allocate your resources carefully and intelligently because the task ahead for the next six months is to defeat Donald Trump,"" said Joel Benenson, a senior Clinton strategist.For Mrs. Clinton, West Virginia never looked to be easy. Democrats there hold an open primary, meaning independents are allowed to take part. Mr. Sanders typically scores well among independents.Ken Mauck, 57, described himself as an independent who voted Tuesday for Mr. Sanders.""Even though I don't agree with Bernie's politics, I agree less with Hillary,"" he said. ""She can't lead, why should I vote for her to be the leader of my county?""Mrs. Clinton did herself no favors when she said at a town-hall meeting in March that her policies would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""Though she also voiced concern for the plight of displaced coal miners, her remarks caused damage that she later sought to minimize. In a visit to West Virginia last week, she said her remarks were taken out of context and that she would work to boost employment in the state. Still, she conceded: ""I know that my chances are pretty difficult [in West Virginia], to be honest.""Mr. Sanders faces a dilemma of his own. He concedes that erasing Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead is difficult in the 11 contests that remain.David Wasserman, a delegate expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said before the West Virginia results were in that Mr. Sanders would need to win 65% of the remaining pledged delegates to pull even with Mrs. Clinton.The Vermont senator is pinning his hopes on superdelegates abandoning Mrs. Clinton and lining up behind his campaign even if he ends the race trailing in pledged delegates.Some of his supporters believe that is a flawed strategy.Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), who has endorsed Mr. Sanders, said: ""I don't think it would feel right in terms of the pledged delegates if one person wins and that's overturned by the superdelegates.""Reid J.

"Trump in Control After Cruz Exits --- Sanders beats Clinton, though his win will do little to disrupt her path to Democratic nomination",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786422422?accountid=12768,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Donald Trump almost certainly snared the Republican Party's presidential nomination by winning a sweeping victory in Indiana's primary Tuesday and forcing his chief rival from the race.Mr. Trump's decisive victory didn't mathematically clinch the GOP nomination, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's departure from the campaign means all that stands between the first-time candidate and accepting the party's nomination in Cleveland is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has won just one state out of 41 so far.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus quickly rallied behind Mr. Trump, calling him the presumptive nominee in a tweet. ""We all need to unite and focus on defeating"" Hillary Clinton, he tweeted.In his victory rally remarks in New York, Mr. Trump himself seemed surprised that the last significant roadblock to his nomination was gone. ""I didn't expect this,"" he said. ""I didn't expect it.""His triumph comes at the tail end of a nominating contest that has defied convention, splintered the party, and left nearly two-thirds of all general election voters with a negative view of Mr. Trump heading into his expected general-election showdown with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Nationwide, Mr. Trump is viewed unfavorably by 65% of voters, according to last month's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. That is higher than Mrs. Clinton, who is seen unfavorably by 56% of voters.In Indiana's Democratic contest, Mrs. Clinton lost to rival Bernie Sanders. However, the Vermont senator's victory margin wasn't large enough to disrupt her path toward her party's nomination.In dropping out of the race, Mr. Cruz conceded he couldn't stop Mr. Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the GOP nomination at the party's July convention.With a sweep of Indiana's 57 delegates, Mr. Trump needs just 225 more. With nine states to go, including Nebraska and West Virginia next week and California on June 7, Mr. Trump needs less than half of the remaining bound delegates to become the nominee.For Mr. Cruz, Tuesday's contest had been his strongest opportunity to change the momentum of the GOP campaign. His team for weeks had pointed to the Midwestern state, comparing it to Wisconsin, where the Texas senator won a convincing victory over Mr. Trump last month.But Mr. Cruz never gained traction in the state. A series of decisions designed to boost his prospects, including naming Carly Fiorina as his running mate, were seen by many voters more as acts of desperation than smart maneuvers.In a concession speech in Indianapolis, Mr. Cruz didn't mention or congratulate Mr. Trump. He said he had planned to stay in the race as long as he saw a path to the convention.""Tonight, I'm sorry to say, it appears that path has been foreclosed,"" he said. ""Together, we left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we've got. But the voters chose another path. And so with a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism for the long term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.""Mr. Kasich's campaign on Tuesday said it would continue until Mr. Trump officially clinches the nomination, which can't happen until California and four other states hold primaries June 7. ""Ted Cruz ran a strong campaign, stood for conservative principles, and exposed a lot about Donald Trump,"" Kasich strategist John Weaver said. ""Gov. Kasich will continue to campaign and offer the voters a clear choice for our country.""Katie Packer, who leads an anti-Trump super PAC that spent $1.3 million against Mr. Trump in Indiana, said her group will continue to fight against the front-runner. ""There is more than a month before the California primary -- more time for Trump to continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters,"" she wrote.Mr. Trump, in victory remarks at Trump Tower in New York that were unusually subdued, hewed to his central campaign message of rescinding international trade deals and promising to create jobs -- in this case for coal miners in West Virginia, which holds the next primary contest May 10.He congratulated Mr. Cruz for being ""one hell of a competitor"" and called the senator's family ""beautiful,"" just hours after accusing Mr. Cruz's father of being complicit in John F. Kennedy's assassination.""Our theme is very simple,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's make America great again. We will make America great again. We will start winning again. You will be so proud of this country very, very soon.""With his hold on the GOP nomination seen as inevitable, Mr. Trump would become the first candidate from either major party to win a presidential nomination without elected or military experience since 1940, when Republican Wendell Willkie lost to President Franklin Roosevelt.Mr. Trump's Indiana victory came after he and Mr. Cruz engaged in the most heated rhetoric of the campaign to date.After Mr. Trump accused Mr. Cruz's father of abetting the Kennedy assassination, Mr. Cruz responded with a stream of epithets, including ""pathological liar,"" ""utterly amoral,"" a ""narcissist,"" and ""serial philanderer.""Mr. Trump responded on Twitter shortly after voting closed at 7 p.m. EDT: ""Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure -- not very presidential. Sad!""The extreme remarks came as part of Mr. Cruz's last-ditch effort to stop Mr. Trump in Indiana, a state he declared would determine the fate of his campaign.Mr. Trump secured his front-runner status on a relatively shoestring budget. His campaign has spent $47 million through the end of March, the latest figures available, of which $35.9 million came in personal loans to the campaign.Mr. Cruz spent $70 million during the same time frame, and a pro-Cruz super PAC doled out $43.6 million to help his candidacy.The businessman now faces the challenge of funding a general election battle against Hillary Clinton, who has raised $213 million in contributions through the end of April.In the 2012 campaign, President Barack Obama spent $721 million and GOP nominee Mitt Romney spent $450 million. Outside groups spent an additional $550 million on the race.One challenge for Mr. Trump heading into the general election will be either raising hundreds of millions of dollars from the very Republican donors he castigated throughout the primary campaign or dipping into his personal fortune at a scale to which he has been resistant so far. Early in the campaign Mr. Trump resisted calls to spend money on advertising, field staff and political professionals. He still doesn't have a polling expert on his staff.---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein and Byron Tau",5/11/16
"Election 2016: As Sanders Wins, Clinton Looks Ahead",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786415846?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders won Indiana's primary Tuesday, giving his flagging presidential campaign ammunition to press forward and making plain front-runner Hillary Clinton's persistent trouble unifying the Democratic Party.Mr. Sanders still faces a wide deficit in convention delegates and virtually no chance to close the gap. He picked up at least 43 of 83 pledged delegates at stake, but Mrs. Clinton took at least 37, according to the Associated Press.Still, the late-in-the-game win by the Vermont senator creates an odd split-screen for the Democrats, with the Clinton campaign increasingly confident of her chances even as Mr. Sanders lays bare her weakness with a large slice of Democrats. Exit polls showed he again beat her among young people, white voters, political independents and people who most value honesty in a candidate.The senator's win in Indiana also may make it more awkward for Mrs. Clinton to look past him, as she did this week. Confident in her delegate lead, she spent much of Tuesday campaigning in the fall battleground state of Ohio. Her campaign in recent days began hiring staff across states expected to be competitive this fall, and her advisers were in the early stages of a vice-presidential selection process.Speaking Tuesday evening in Louisville, Ky., before the results were announced, Mr. Sanders noted how far his campaign has come since its early days a year ago and highlighted his strong support with young voters.""That is important because it tells me that the ideas that we are fighting for are the ideas of the future of America,"" he said.The speech showed Mr. Sanders in no mood for party unification, as some Democrats would like. He hit Mrs. Clinton on her paid speeches to Wall Street, her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her support for a $12-an-hour -- but not $15 -- federal minimum wage, which he thundered was ""not good enough!""This month is likely to bring Mr. Sanders additional wins in a string of primaries in Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon and Kentucky.The voting wraps up in June, with big prizes including California and New Jersey. Democratic rules allocate delegates proportionately, meaning the loser gets nearly as many delegates as the winner in close races, making it hard to catch up.Mr. Sanders made a strong play for Indiana, spending $1.5 million in TV ads and headlining a half-dozen rallies. State rules were in his favor, allowing independents, who typically favor him, to participate in the primary.Mrs. Clinton spent no money on TV ads and appeared at just three campaign rallies in Indiana. Campaign officials said they were husbanding funds raised for the primary campaign to spend later this spring and summer in states that are likely to be competitive in the fall.""I think we had a good campaign"" in Indiana,Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday on MSNBC. ""We ran hard. But you know I'm really focused on moving into the general election.""Mr. Sanders and his aides acknowledged it was virtually impossible for him to overtake her lead in pledged delegates, the type chosen by voters. Instead, they said he would work to win over superdelegates, party leaders who can vote for whomever they like and who currently favor Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin.Indiana voters split along familiar lines, with Sanders supporters lauding the breadth of his ideas and Clinton supporters calling her more pragmatic, experienced and more electable in the fall.""I think he's very relatable and I just agree with his ideas,"" said Sommer Hofman, a 17-year-old student in Carmel, Ind., who cast her first ballot for the Vermont senator on Tuesday.""I like some of his ideas but I think the most important thing is that we win in November,"" said Jack Carrithers, 68, a retired ad executive from outside of Indianapolis.Coming into the balloting, Mrs. Clinton had 1,645 pledged delegates and Mr. Sanders had 1,318, meaning her lead was 327. Including superdelegates, she had 2,165 delegates to his 1,357, according to Associated Press tallies. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to claim the nomination.---Byron Tau contributed to this article.Credit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",5/11/16
Bernie Wins Again; Plus Facebook should come clean on its news judgments.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787920895?accountid=12768,"Vermont's socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the West Virginia Democratic primary on Tuesday. With 97% of precincts reporting, Mr. Sanders won 51% of the votes to Mrs. Clinton's 36%. She didn't help herself by promising to put coal miners out of business --and then offering a non-apology for her remarks . But her inability to win over large swaths of the Democratic electorate, despite her apparent lock on the nomination, is a nationwide problem. She faces more potential trouble in Oregon and Kentucky next week. In any normal year, the story of this election season would be her failure to consolidate party support.Morning Editorial ReportClick here to receive WSJ Opinion headlines and commentary via email.That's politics. On policy, Mrs. Clinton ""is methodically expanding her plans to supervise or subsidize those remaining spheres of human existence unspoiled by government,"" notes a Journal editorial . And even some that government has already spoiled. On Tuesday she rolled out still another plan for child care, even though the federal government already has at least 45 such programs . She also suggested expanding Medicare to cover more Americans. ""This old chestnut would be another huge step toward government-run single-payer health care, intended to squeeze out private insurance slice by slice,"" writes the editorial board .Facebook is denying anti-conservative bias. But a Journal editorial says that if the social-media giant ""isn't manipulating content to crowd out conservatives, then the company should offer the evidence to investors and the public .""A 30-year-old prince is trying to revolutionize Saudi Arabia . Karen Elliott House writes that the vision of Mohammed bin Salman ""includes reducing the country's dependence on oil ; privatizing the economy ... turning Saudi citizens from dependents of the government into self-reliant individuals; expanding work opportunities for women ; creating more jobs for young people; imposing taxes for the first time; encouraging a more-moderate form of Islam; and even sanctioning various forms of public entertainment --this, in a country that bans cinema.""A 1980 court order intended to prevent segregation is now forcing a St. Louis charter school to turn away a black child who has been thriving in the classroom. His mother tells Jason Riley , ""I just broke down crying and thinking, how am I going to tell my 9-year-old that he can't go back to the school, not because we moved but because of his skin color. ""Almost nobody goes hungry in America and even many poor people are too fat, says Harvard's Robert Paarlberg . ""Micronutrient deficits can be hard to detect, and they can coexist with obesity, but data have shown for some time that nutrient intake in America is roughly comparable for poor and non-poor Americans. A 1995 Agriculture Department report showed that the average intake of vitamins, minerals and protein was similar for children in poverty compared with those who were not.

""Contrary to popular belief, ATMs didn't displace bank tellers . Instead, the number of bank tellers rose even as ATMs became more prevalent. Why? Machines freed people up to take on tasks requiring more creativity and initiative , including individualized customer service across a wide variety of financial transactions.""And finally, former Soviet political prisoner Natan Sharansky writes about the publisher and human-rights activist whose support was ""exceptional and profoundly encouraging to those of us trapped behind the Iron Curtain .""Credit: By James Freeman",5/12/16
West Virginia Primary Presents Another Bernie Sanders Speed Bump for Hillary Clinton; Win in West Virginia would give Sanders a boost as campaign heads to states on West Coast,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787854381?accountid=12768,"MARTINSBURG, W.Va.--Bernie Sanders seems poised to regain momentum in West Virginia's primary election Tuesday, leaving some of front-runner Hillary Clinton's backers uneasy that her path to the Democratic presidential nomination figures to be rocky to the end.Recent polls show Mr. Sanders leading in the state by 4 to 8 percentage points.On the Republican side, the Associated Press projected Donald Trump as the winner of the West Virginia primary almost immediately after the polls closed. Mr. Trump faces no opposition and is now considered the presumptive nominee, though he is still campaigning in states holding primaries. He spent the weekend stumping in Nebraska and West Virginia--the two states holding GOP primaries Tuesday. He also appeared in the next two states on the GOP calendar, Oregon and Washington, calling Mrs. Clinton ""Crooked Hillary"" at rallies.Mr. Trump has set his gaze on the general election in the fall, setting up a fundraising team and tapping New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to lead the transition should he be elected president.Related* What to Expect in Tuesday's West Virginia, Nebraska Primaries* Polls Show Tight Races in Key Swing States, Warning Signs for Hillary Clinton* Hillary Clinton Says She's Weighing Medicare for 50-Year-Olds* How Political Dysfunction Fueled the Rise of Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump* Joe Biden Predicts Hillary Clinton Will Be Next President* Donald Trump Narrows VP List; Marco Rubio Not InterestedA Sanders victory of any size in West Virginia wouldn't dislodge Mrs. Clinton from her commanding position in a primary fight that has outlasted the Republican contest. West Virginia offers only 29 Democratic delegates and, under party rules that award them on a proportional basis, Mrs. Clinton is unlikely to come away empty-handed.But polls suggest Mr. Sanders could notch wins next week in Oregon and Kentucky, demonstrating that a sizable wing of the party remains attracted to his populist message and isn't yet ready to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton even though the nomination is in her grasp.Victories also tend to fuel Mr. Sanders's fundraising, giving him more money to air TV ads and prolong the fight.""I'm always uncomfortable when she loses,"" said New Hampshire state senator Lou D'Allesandro, a Clinton supporter. ""Every time [Mr. Sanders] presents himself and presents his story, more people start talking about him. And that goes on and on.""He said he has written emails to the Clinton campaign asking that they compete more aggressively in upcoming contests.""You want to enter the convention with the best possible wind at your back,"" Mr. D'Allesandro added.At this late stage in the contest, the delegate math remains decisively in Mrs. Clinton's favor. She led Mr. Sanders by 290 pledged delegates heading into the West Virginia primary. With superdelegates thrown in, her lead stood at 2,228 to 1,454. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.Mrs. Clinton is likely to have a better month in June, when large, diverse states such as California and New Jersey hold primaries. She has fared better in states with large concentrations of minority voters.But until she clinches the nomination, she is forced to spend money and time on the primary race, lest she endure more potentially embarrassing defeats.May 10 Primary ResultsLosses to Mr. Sanders are ""absolutely injurious to her political fortunes,"" said Doug Schoen, a pollster who has advised Bill Clinton. ""He hurts her ability to solidify the party and to raise money and to campaign effectively against Donald Trump.""One of Mrs. Clinton's top advisers suggested her campaign isn't about to waste resources and is aware that the central battle is the showdown with Mr. Trump.""You finish out the primaries, and you allocate your resources carefully and intelligently because the task ahead for the next six months is to defeat Donald Trump,"" said Joel Benenson, a senior Clinton strategist.For Mrs. Clinton, West Virginia never looked to be easy. Democrats there hold an open primary, meaning independents are allowed to take part. Mr. Sanders typically scores well among independents.Ken Mauck, 57, described himself as an independent who voted Tuesday for Mr. Sanders.""Even though I don't agree with Bernie's politics, I agree less with Hillary,"" he said. ""She can't lead, why should I vote for her to be the leader of my county?""Mrs. Clinton did herself no favors when she said at a town-hall meeting in March that her policies would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""Though she also voiced concern for the plight of displaced coal miners, her remarks caused damage that she later sought to minimize. In a visit to West Virginia last week, she said her remarks were taken ""out of context"" and that she would work to boost employment in the state.Still, she conceded: ""I know that my chances are pretty difficult [in West Virginia], to be honest.""Mr. Sanders faces a dilemma of his own. He concedes that erasing Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead is difficult in the 11 contests that remain.David Wasserman, a delegate expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said before the West Virginia results were in that Mr. Sanders would need to win 65% of the remaining pledged delegates to pull even with Mrs. Clinton.The Vermont senator is pinning his hopes on superdelegates abandoning Mrs. Clinton and lining up behind his campaign even if he ends the race trailing in pledged delegates.Some of his supporters believe that is a flawed strategy.U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), who has endorsed Mr. Sanders, said: ""I don't think it would feel right in terms of the pledged delegates if one person wins and that's overturned by the superdelegates.""Reid Epstein contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau",5/12/16
"Bernie Sanders's Staying Power in Presidential Race Surprises Senators; Democratic candidate continues to advance in primary race, outlasting rivals across the aisle",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788373231?accountid=12768,"Few members of the Senate would have predicted a year ago that Bernie Sanders would be the last of five of their colleagues remaining in the final stretches of the presidential primary race.Unlike Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , who returned to the chamber this week, or Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida , who ended his campaign in March, the independent from Vermont doesn't seem to have planned years ahead for a White House run. When he entered the race last spring , he made clear his goal was largely to promote liberal policies and press Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to embrace them.""I thought it was more an ideologically driven desire to bring issues up"" than personal ambition, Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said of Mr. Sanders's foray into presidential politics.But to the surprise of many on Capitol Hill, Mr. Sanders has stayed in the primary race longer than any of his rivals across the aisle. In addition to Messrs. Cruz and Rubio, Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina waged unsuccessful primary bids.Read more* Bernie Sanders Wins West Virginia Democratic Primary (May 10)* Bernie Sanders Nets 31 Delegates in Washington State (May 7)* Independents Are Souring on Hillary Clinton (May 4)""He's surprised a lot of people and exceeded a lot of people's expectations,"" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate GOP leadership.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said he had expected Mrs. Clinton to blunt Mr. Sanders's momentum much earlier in the process. Instead, Mr. Sanders has continued winning contests, including Indiana last week and the West Virginia primary Tuesday.""My gosh, at his age, to be able to be as energetic as he is, that's terrific,"" the 82-year-old Mr. Hatch said of the 74-year-old Mr. Sanders. ""I don't agree with him. I think he's basically a socialist, but I give him a lot of credit.""Though Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates Mr. Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has resisted calls from some in the Democratic Party to drop out and let her focus on her race against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump.His supporters chalk up his success to a style that registers as authentic and to his focus on issues important to Democratic voters, including Wall Street regulation, income inequality, climate change, college affordability and campaign finance.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said he ""has big ideas that are resonating with Americans who want to fix our rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign-finance system.""His stances ""deeply resonate with the American public,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore), the only senator to endorse Mr. Sanders, concurs. ""That's why he's still in the campaign.""Mr. Merkley noted that political prognosticators, including lawmakers, have misjudged this election year at every turn. ""Nobody thought that Trump would still be in the race and nobody thought Bernie would still be in the race. That kind of sums it up,"" he said.Some Sanders critics say his enduring popularity reflects more on Mrs. Clinton's flaws than on his own virtues. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the former Secretary of State's use of a private email server to conduct official State Department business.""That says more about Hillary Clinton,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who has endorsed Mr. Trump. ""She's still losing primaries, even a mainstream state like Indiana.""Sen. Angus King of Maine, the only other independent in the chamber, offered a different explanation for Mr. Sanders's appeal. ""People like independents,"" he said. Both lawmakers caucus with the Democrats.Mr. Sanders also may benefit from the year's catchiest slogan. Sen. Pat Roberts (R., Kan.) deployed it Wednesday. ""Well, a lot of people are feeling the Bern,"" he said.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comCredit: By Kristina Peterson",5/13/16

Bernie Sanders might be the next President.The 74-year-old socialist won West Virginia's primary on Tuesday, his 19th victory and second in a row. He still trails Hillary Clinton 1,719 to 1,425 in bound delegates, by CNN's count, but he's won a majority of the delegates since March 1. If he sweeps the final 10 primaries and caucuses, he might take the lead among bound delegates heading into the Democratic convention in July.But then there are the superdelegates, the Democratic officeholders who can vote their preference and who overwhelmingly favor Mrs. Clinton. Of the 712 superdelegates, CNN counts 516 for the former first lady and 41 for the forlorn Senator from Vermont. This means she needs only 148 more delegates to clinch a majority for the nomination. As the primary season ends, Democratic voters are exhibiting a profound case of buyer's remorse about Mrs. Clinton as their nominee, but she's being rescued by the establishment.Here's another irony: The superdelegates favor Mrs. Clinton in large part because they think she'd be the stronger candidate against Donald Trump, but Mr. Sanders does far better in head-to-head polls against the Republican. A Dartmouth College poll has Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump by five points in New Hampshire, but Mr. Sanders leads by 21. This week's Quinnipiac poll has the Burlington bank basher doing better than Mrs. Clinton in Ohio and Pennsylvania.Mrs. Clinton has proven to be a lousy candidate, unappealing even to millions of Democrats.

Hillary Clinton Fights for a Win in Kentucky; The Democrat looks to snap Sanders's streak while keeping an eye on Republican Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788923487?accountid=12768,"LOUISVILLE, Ky.--Democrat Hillary Clinton made a final push in Kentucky ahead of Tuesday's presidential primary, looking to snap a losing streak against Sen.

At a rally at a union training facility, she hit Mr. Trump for his ""reckless"" and ""scary, dangerous"" approach to national security.

Hillary Clinton Looks to Avoid Convention Fight as Bernie Sanders Presses Agenda; Senator's campaign is demanding that Democratic platform reflect his message,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788609476?accountid=12768,"Looking to avoid a messy Democratic convention this summer, people close to likely nominee Hillary Clinton predict she will give Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders much of what he wants on the party's platform. But at least for now, the Sanders forces are itching for a fight.Already, Mr. Sanders has accused the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee of stacking convention committees in favor of the former secretary of state and has threatened a floor fight if he isn't treated fairly.""This convention should be a real debating place about what the party is and what it should stand for,"" said Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser and retired labor leader.Mrs. Clinton says Mr. Sanders has ""every right"" to continue competing until the last votes are cast, but she has made clear that she expects unity to follow, as it did following her 2008 defeat. ""We're going to unify the party, and we're going to have a great convention,"" she said last week on MSNBC.The different messages reflect the candidates' differing situations. Mrs. Clinton is gearing up for the fall contest; Mr. Sanders is still hoping to wrest the prize from her and, barring that, push the Democratic Party closer to his populist agenda.It is possible that the two sides will reach accommodation after the voting ends in mid-June and before the convention begins in late July. At the moment, though, they appear far from an agreement over the tone and substance of the four-day gathering, which the Clinton campaign views as one of its best opportunities to communicate her vision to voters.Her campaign is in the early stages of planning the program, including who will deliver major speeches and what the overall themes should be. Meantime, people close to the campaign said they were waiting for a signal from Mr. Sanders as to what he wants and how the pair can come together.Mr. Sanders is promising a ""contested convention"" and says the nominee won't be chosen until delegates arrive in Philadelphia. His campaign also is demanding that the Democratic platform reflect his message and a handful of major changes to how the party picks future nominees.With eight states plus the District of Columbia yet to vote, it is almost impossible for Mr. Sanders to overtake Mrs. Clinton's lead among pledged delegates, the type chosen by voters. He also trails badly among superdelegates, party leaders who can vote for whomever they like.Short of an outright win, aides say Mr. Sanders will insist that a range of his positions be reflected in the platform, including a single-payer, government-run health program; a $15 federal minimum wage; expanded Social Security benefits; opposition to free-trade agreements; and free tuition at public colleges. In each case, Mrs. Clinton has alternative views that don't go as far as his do.""It's not about unifying the party,"" said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's policy chief, who will likely represent the campaign on the platform-drafting committee. ""It's about making sure we have big, bold change that will fundamentally transform the U.S. economy....There are still fundamental disagreements.""Mrs. Clinton has argued that most of the Sanders plans are unrealistic and that some of them are unworkable. But several Clinton allies said the campaign is likely to let him insert at least some of what he wants in the party platform. That is partly because they don't see the two as being very far apart, and partly because they say the platform language doesn't really matter anyway.Hilary Rosen, a Democratic consultant who is close to the Clinton campaign, predicted that the campaign would have an ""open mind"" on these issues and ""a commitment to progressive values.""""We've heard time and again from Hillary Clinton in the last couple of weeks that she respects Sen. Sanders and she respects his supporters. As far as the Clinton team is concerned, most everything is on the table in terms of how do we most effectively come out of that convention united,"" she said.Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, another Clinton ally, predicted much more comity than confrontation. Disputes, he said, can be handled in a ""healthy way.""""If both sides go at these disagreements with the right spirit, you can reach some clearly good agreements,"" he said.Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon also suggested that her campaign isn't looking for a fight. ""Hillary Clinton is proud of the progressive ideas she put forward in this campaign, and we expect the platform will reflect those ideas,"" he said. ""She has also made clear that there is much more that unites Democrats than divides us.""The Sanders campaign is also pushing for changes affecting the rules of the party and how future presidential nominations are decided. Priorities include reducing the power of superdelegates, pressuring states to allow independents to vote in party primaries and swearing off super-PAC contributions in primary races, said Mr. Cohen, the Sanders adviser, who is also a member of the Democratic National Committee. He said these points should be debated by the convention's rules committee.It is unclear whether the committee will have the power to deal with these issues. A DNC spokesman said party rules give that panel jurisdiction over rules related to the 2016 convention, not delegate selection or other matters. Other experts on party rules say that these issues could be debated in Philadelphia with recommendations for future action.Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a Clinton ally who will serve as co-chairman of the rules committee, said he is sympathetic to some of the Sanders agenda, including reducing the power of superdelegates as a move to make the process more democratic.As for issues, Mr. Frank doesn't anticipate big fights.""There aren't major issue divisions between [Mr. Sanders] and Hillary Clinton,"" he said.He said Mr. Sanders's call for a $15 minimum wage is ""very likely"" to be included in a platform, even though Mrs. Clinton backs $12. And Mrs. Clinton herself took a step toward Mr. Sanders on health care this week when she floated the idea of expanding eligibility for Medicare to people as young as 50, who could buy in.Mr. Frank said Democrats have been for ""Medicare for all"" before. ""I don't think there's any problem with that being an ultimate goal.""Credit: By Laura Meckler",5/16/16
"School Once Run by Jane Sanders Plans to Close, After Expansion Fails; Burlington College says $10 million acquisition left it mired in debt",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789096097?accountid=12768,"Burlington College, a tiny Vermont liberal arts school once led by Jane Sanders, the wife of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, said it is shutting down because of financial problems associated with a property acquisition she oversaw.In a formal statement announcing its closure, the school cited the ""crushing weight"" of debt it took on in a 2010 purchase of more than 30 acres from the local Catholic archdiocese. Mrs. Sanders was the college's president at the time of the $10 million deal.The college had financial challenges before Mrs. Sanders took the helm. In her seven years there, she attempted an ambitious expansion of the school's physical footprint and 200-student body. But the major investment didn't bear fruit in terms of drawing more students and bringing in higher tuition revenue, and the school's financial health has remained fragile since. She resigned in 2011.An attempt to reach Mrs. Sanders through the Sanders campaign wasn't immediately answered.Many smaller colleges are facing bleak fiscal futures, with many forced to offer significant scholarships to woo students but barely breaking even on what tuition revenue they bring in, as expenses continue to rise. The National Association of College and University Business Officers reported Monday that the discount rate for freshmen at private colleges this year hit a record 48.6%, meaning students pay just over 50 cents on every dollar of published tuition.Burlington said in a statement Monday that it has cut its debt to a ""manageable level"" through property sales, but learned last month that its lender wouldn't renew a credit line, which is needed to cover costs between semesters.Burlington's accreditor, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, placed it on probation in 2014 because of financial concerns. It is allowed to remain on probation for only two years.""These hurdles are insurmountable at this time,"" the school said.Burlington's board of trustees voted Friday to close its programs effective May 27. The school held its commencement ceremony for the class of 2016 on Saturday.Current students will be able to complete their studies at nearby colleges, Burlington said.Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.comCredit: By Melissa Korn",5/17/16

"Democrats Fear an Unruly July Convention in Philadelphia; Bernie Sanders backers seek permits to demonstrate, sparking worries of damage to party and Hillary Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789617624?accountid=12768,"A growing number of Democrats are bracing for a divisive and disorderly July presidential convention in Philadelphia that could damage the party and expected nominee Hillary Clinton.A loose coalition of supporters of rival Sen. Bernie Sanders is using social media to plan a series of events at the Democratic National Convention. Using pro-Sanders blogs and websites, organizers will be pressing to insert his progressive agenda--from free college tuition to revisions in the primary process--into the party's platform.At least five of the nine permit applications to hold demonstrations during the four-day event have been filed by pro-Sanders forces with the Philadelphia city government, according to the mayor's office. The groups planning the events are named The Berners, Black Men for Bernie, Movement for Bernie and Bernie-or-Bust. No applications have been filed yet by supporters of Mrs. Clinton.Cleveland, the site of the Republican National Convention, which was once expected to be a disruptive event, reported receiving six permit applications as of early May--none indicating that they are in support of any former Republican candidates.""I really wouldn't call it a protest. It's a political revolution. It's something that we will celebrate,"" said Bill Taylor, a 30-year-old Philadelphia resident and Sanders campaign volunteer who is helping organize the demonstrations at the convention. ""There is no stopping the movement that Bernie has created. This isn't about one man.""The prospective protests could undermine efforts by the party to unite its wings for the fall fight against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, and overshadow the fact that Mrs. Clinton's is the first female nominee of a major U.S. political party.Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump inched closer to clinching their respective nominations on Tuesday, as the former secretary of state declared victory in the Kentucky primary and Mr. Trump rolled up a win in Oregon. Mr. Sanders won the Oregon Democratic primary, though he has almost no chance of catching Mrs. Clinton in the race for the 2,383 delegates needed to win.Doug Schoen, a polling expert who has advised former President Bill Clinton, said the divisions within the party ""appear to be widening, not narrowing, in ways that could be calamitous, particularly if there is ongoing chaos at the Democratic convention.""The animus between Mr. Sanders and some party leaders boiled over into public view on Saturday, when his backers, angry over the delegate allocation at a Nevada state convention that favored Mrs. Clinton, began shouting, throwing chairs and issuing death threats to the state party chairwoman. Mrs. Clinton won the Feb. 20 Nevada caucuses.In a text message exchange, one person warned: ""We know where you live...where you work...where you eat...where your kids go to school/grandkids...we have everything on you,"" before adding: ""You made a bad choice. Prepare for hell.""While party leaders urged Mr. Sanders to act as a calming influence, he inflamed tensions by issuing a complicated statement that condemned violence, justified his supporters' frustrations and railed against the party's process for selecting a nominee.During a California rally Tuesday night, he delivered a message to Democratic leaders, urging them to ""do the right thing"" and welcome into the fold people who are prepared to fight for the economic and social change proposals in his platform.""I say to the leadership of the Democratic Party: Open the doors. Let the people in,"" Mr. Sanders shouted.Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said on CNN she deemed Mr. Sanders's response unacceptable.By Wednesday, many Democrats appeared eager to move on from the kerfuffle. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called for unity, while adding that harassment and intimidation were unacceptable in the primary process.""We are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose--to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trump's hands,"" Mr. Mook said.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* What Kentucky Results Show About Clinton-Sanders Battle* Trump Names 11 Potential Supreme Court Nominees* Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Face Hurdle Not Seen in Modern History* GOP Near Agreement With Treasury on Puerto Rico Bill* Trump Details His Income SourcesBut the Sanders team refused to relent. Asked on MSNBC if the campaign regretted the tone of its initial remarks, campaign manager John Weaver said: ""No, I don't, as a matter of fact.""While he called the people who made threatening phone calls ""idiots,"" Mr. Weaver then rattled off a litany of grudges against the DNC, ranging from the debate schedule to the primary rules.Protest organizers say their goal will be to prod the party to make long-term changes to the way it nominates candidates, such as curbing or eliminating the influence of superdelegates--who include many Democratic officeholders--and making more of the primaries open to independents and Republicans.A secondary goal is to convince many of the current superdelegates that Mr. Sanders would be a stronger candidate in the general election, though those delegates are the very party officials and elected leaders whom Mr. Sanders is currently challenging.""Of course, we would like to try to convince some superdelegates to sway their vote,"" said Steve Okan Layne, 24, a Michigan resident and campaign volunteer who helped organize one of the events in Philadelphia.A senior aide to the Sanders campaign said it had little control over what his most ardent supporters might do in Philadelphia or beyond.""They are the committed, passionate, ideological, issue-driven base of the party,"" said the aide. ""The establishment wing of the party just wants to treat them like they are transactional folks who will step into line. If that's the way they are going to treat them throughout the convention, that's where we're going to have real trouble.""California Sen. Dianne Feinstein expressed concerns about the July convention, saying that Mr. Sanders should have sent a full-throated message to his supporters what happened in Nevada wouldn't be tolerated.""I don't want to go back to the '68 convention,"" she told CNN, referring to the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago. ""I worry about what it does to the electorate as a whole, and he should, too.""While relatively few Democratic officials came to Mr. Sanders's defense in the wake of the Nevada convention, Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.) said that Mr. Sanders had responded appropriately.""I don't know what more of an apology people want,"" he said. ""That, to a great extent, is an apology. This campaign has instructed everybody in the field that that's not to occur. I don't know what else is expected.""Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.Credit: By Byron Tau and Colleen McCain Nelson",5/19/16

"Hillary Needs to Feel the Bern; She's got the votes but not Democratic hearts. For that, Clinton needs Sanders's full support.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789312873?accountid=12768,"As this column goes to press, Hillary Clinton has nearly 95% of the 2,383 delegates she needs to claim the Democratic presidential nomination. She leads Sen. Bernie Sanders by 667 delegates overall, and by nearly 300 among delegates selected through primaries and caucuses. She has outpaced him by 3.1 million in the popular vote. By June 7 at the latest she will be able to claim the mantle of Democratic nominee.But if Mrs. Clinton is the head of the Democratic Party, Mr. Sanders is its heart. This reflects, in part, long-cycle changes that have altered the balance of ideological power within the party. At the end of Bill Clinton's administration, according to Gallup, only 29% of rank-and-file Democrats thought of themselves as liberal, versus 44% who self-identified as moderate.As the current nomination contest began, by contrast, the share of liberals within the party had risen by 16 points to 45%, while the moderates' share fell by nine points to 35%. During these 16 years, the share of conservatives within the Democratic Party fell from 25% to 17%. So Bernie Sanders is addressing a party much more receptive to his message than it would have been two decades ago.But something else is going on as well. Over the past eight years, the enthusiastic ""Yes we can"" slogan of the first Obama campaign has turned into ""Maybe we can't after all""--certainly not all at once.This transition has left many Democrats--especially young adults whom Barack Obama mobilized into politics--deeply frustrated. Some have checked out of electoral politics, but others have redoubled their efforts.This latter group favors a strategy of shifting the center of gravity of political debate by upping the political ante. We can't get a modest increase in the minimum wage through Congress? Fine, let's push for $15 an hour. We couldn't get a public option in the Affordable Care Act? Let's demand Medicare for all. Conservatives want to cut Social Security? Let's stop playing defense and turn the tables by calling for an increase in monthly benefits.Mr. Sanders champions this shift to going on offense, which is why so many Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents--more than just about anyone expected a year ago--have rallied behind him.These Democrats believe that Mrs. Clinton is advocating a timid and self-defeating incrementalism. They think she is saying that the slow, hard-won progress of the Obama years is the best we can do. For them, realism is unrealistic and practicality is impractical. We can only achieve fundamental change, they say, by advancing a bold vision that captures the public's imagination and stirs them to act.Mr. Sanders must know that he won't end up as the Democratic presidential nominee, which is why he is now using his leverage to pull the party as far as he can in his direction. He will demand--and receive--a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic convention.He is also pushing for--but is less likely to get--a change in the party's nomination rules. Mr. Sanders wants to open up all party primaries to independents, but this is a matter over which individual states have long exercised iron control. He wants to ban super PAC contributions in primary races, but federal law and Supreme Court decisions limit what a political party can do in this area. And he wants to reduce the power of superdelegates--the party and elected officials at the Democratic convention who are free to vote as they wish (this year they have overwhelmingly pledged to support Mrs. Clinton). Similar efforts have failed in the past because superdelegates are not inclined to support their own disempowerment.This leaves the party platform, which offers greater scope for accommodation. Mr. Sanders will seek to graft his entire agenda into this document, and he is likely to get much of what he seeks, including a $15 an hour target for the minimum wage and the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, which drew a bright line between commercial and investment banking.Mrs. Clinton may balk at his proposed single-payer health-care proposal and his promise of free college for all. As a general matter, however, she will give as much ground as she can. As Democratic Party and convention veteran Elaine Kamarck tells me: ""It's a lot easier to compromise on the platform when you're a non-incumbent"" and your adversary is not demanding that you repudiate your administration's policies.Hillary Clinton wants to emerge from the convention at the head of a united party. She will need Bernie Sanders's full-throated support and the backing of his followers. As France's King Henry IV famously said when he renounced Protestantism in 1593 to end his country's religious wars, ""Paris is worth a Mass."" So is the White House.Credit: By William A.

Election 2016: Superdelegates Come Under Pressure --- Some Clinton backers urged to change their stance after Sanders's recent victories,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778675003?accountid=12768,"Along with his takeout from the vegan chain Native Foods Cafe, Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado received this note: ""The constituency has spoken. Use your power wisely. Feel the Bern.""Mr. Polis, a superdelegate who has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, acknowledged the pressure on him to change his position in a state where Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont handily won the Democratic caucuses. ""Even my food takeout is lobbying me for #FeelTheBern,"" Mr. Polis tweeted late last month.Mr. Sanders's recent victories in Colorado, Hawaii, Washington, Alaska and elsewhere have left some other Democrats defending their decision to back Mrs. Clinton at the party's convention in Philadelphia this July.And more could feel the pressure if Mr. Sanders continues to rack up wins. He won the Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday, notching his seventh win in the last eight nominating contests. Democratic lawmakers in Wisconsin including Rep. Gwen Moore and Sen. Tammy Baldwin backed Mrs. Clinton. All Democratic members of Congress are superdelegates.Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who backs Mrs. Clinton, said he has had some ""robust conversations"" with constituents after Mr. Sanders won the state's Democratic caucuses on March 26, but doesn't plan to shift his stance.""A lot of my strongest supporters are on both sides of the presidential campaign, but I have no doubt we'll be able to hang together and come back together during the convention,"" Mr. Schatz said Monday, adding a vigorous primary would strengthen the process.As of Monday, Mrs. Clinton was leading the Democratic race in pledged delegates 1,243 to 980. When superdelegates are thrown in, her lead grows: 1,712 to 1,011. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.Mr. Sanders's campaign has said that those superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials free to back whomever they choose -- should pay attention to Mr. Sanders's momentum and abandon Mrs. Clinton.""A lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Sanders said on CNN in late March. ""I think their own constituents are going to say to them, hey, why don't you support the people of our state, vote for Sanders?""So far, that doesn't seem to be happening. Mrs. Clinton has the backing of far more congressional lawmakers than Mr. Sanders and none have defected after Sanders victories.""I am supporting Hillary Clinton and I will continue to do that,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and superdelegate, said last week in her home state, whose primary Mr. Sanders won in early February.The Clinton campaign has said that the former secretary of state's victories in primaries demonstrate that more Democratic voters support her than Mr. Sanders, whose wins have largely come in caucus states with fewer participants.""For most of the campaign, Senator Sanders has criticized the role that superdelegates play in the nominating process, but as he now campaigns without a clear path [to] the nomination that relies on the voters, he's aggressively courting their support,"" Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, said in a memo.Superdelegates supporting Mr. Sanders have occasionally found themselves in the reverse situation.Rep. Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was the first member of Congress to endorse Mr. Sanders. Last month, Mrs. Clinton won the Arizona primary. A superdelegate, Mr. Grijalva is still backing Mr. Sanders.Mr. Grijalva said he isn't facing a backlash from his district over his endorsement, though he has questions about the role of superdelegates. While they remain part of the system, however, Mr. Grijalva said he would continue to support Mr. Sanders. ""My resolve is as strong as his, which is to keep going,"" he said.Credit: By Kristina Peterson",5/19/16
"Election 2016: Each Front-Runner Hits a Hurdle --- Exit polls show GOP groups swung to Cruz, while Sanders drew on his liberal base",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778674939?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin dealt a setback to the presidential campaign's front-runners, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but for different reasons in each party.Democratic voting patterns mirrored those of many prior contests, with Mrs. Clinton building large margins among African-Americans and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders carrying younger voters, independents and liberals. In a state heavy on liberals and light on minority voters, the voting pool included far more of Mr. Sanders's base voters than traditional Clinton supporters.The Republican story was different: Voting groups that had given only tepid support to Sen. Ted Cruz swung more squarely behind him in Wisconsin, enabling him to overcome Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, for example, had built big margins in prior contests among lower-income voters and those without college degrees. In Wisconsin, Mr. Cruz narrowly won those groups or tied his top rival, according to surveys of voters as they left their polling places.Mr. Trump had carried self-described conservative voters in Michigan, another big Midwestern state, which he won last month. But in Wisconsin, those voters backed Mr. Cruz, exit polls reported by CNN and other media showed.The Wisconsin exit polls suggested that Mr. Trump may have a growing problem with women. He won only 36% of their vote on Tuesday, while Mr. Cruz captured 48%.Mr. Trump's support among women was actually a slight improvement over the results from two other Midwestern states, Michigan and Ohio. But as the GOP field winnows, a 36% share of women would signal a weakness in his support.Republican voters were asked to weigh in on one of the overriding questions of the GOP primary race: What should happen if no candidate wins a majority of delegates before the party's national convention?Under party rules, the only way to clinch the presidential nomination is to win support from more than half of the 2,472 convention delegates. But more than half of Republican voters in Wisconsin -- some 56% -- said that if no one meets that standard, then the candidate with the most primary votes should claim the nomination, according to exit polls reported by various media.By contrast, some 42% of Wisconsin Republicans endorsed the party's regular procedures and said the convention delegates should pick whomever they think would be the best nominee.Not surprisingly, supporters of Mr. Trump favored the scenario that would best suit their candidate, as did Mr. Cruz's backers. Mr. Trump's supporters were most likely to say that the candidate with the most primary votes should become the nominee, while Mr. Cruz's supporters were more likely to say that a contested convention should be decided by the delegates.In the Democratic race, each candidate drew on familiar voting blocs. Mr. Sanders retained his hold on young voters, carrying 81% of those ages 18 to 29, according to exit polls reported by CNN and other media.Mr. Sanders won 71% of independents who cast ballots in the primary while tying Mrs. Clinton among Democratic Party members. He carried 60% of voters who rated themselves ""very liberal.""The party's youngest and most liberal voters, as well as independents, have been pillars of Mr. Sanders's support in prior contests.Mrs. Clinton retained her hold on nonwhite voters, particularly African-Americans.Those familiar voting patterns left Mrs. Clinton at a disadvantage. She won 74% of black voters, but they accounted for less than a tenth of the electorate -- half the share that African-Americans accounted for in Ohio, the Midwestern state that Mrs. Clinton won last month.Some 84% of voters in Wisconsin's Democratic primary were white, exit polls showed, compared with 74% in Ohio.Some 66% of Wisconsin voters described themselves as liberal, a dramatically larger share than in 2008, during the last competitive Democratic primary. That year, only 47% rated themselves liberal. The share of Democratic voters calling themselves moderate or conservative fell from 53% to 32% over eight years. Those changes in the party helped Mr. Sanders.Credit: By Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni",5/19/16
Election 2016: Sanders Win Extends His Recent Gains,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778674936?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders's defeat Tuesday of Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin's Democratic primary extends his recent string of victories and adds momentum heading into a pivotal showdown in two weeks in New York state.Speaking at a rally in Wyoming -- site of a Saturday Democratic caucus -- Mr. Sanders told the audience about his solid victory in Wisconsin, prompting chants of ""Bernie! Bernie!"" He thanked voters in Wisconsin and noted his victories have been coming ""with overwhelming, landslide numbers.""Mrs. Clinton didn't make a public appearance but sent a tweet congratulating Mr. Sanders. ""To all the voters and volunteers who poured your hearts into this campaign: Forward!"" Mrs. Clinton said.Trailing in pledged convention delegates, Mr. Sanders was hoping a resounding win in Wisconsin would affirm he remains a viable candidate with a chance to wrest the nomination away from Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator and secretary of state. He has now won seven of the past eight nominating contests, his best stretch since the race began.The Sanders camp now hopes party officials known as superdelegates will see these results and conclude he would be the stronger candidate in the November election. Most superdelegates are now backing Mrs. Clinton, but they are free to change their minds at any point and support someone else.At the same time, Mr. Sanders faces daunting delegate math. Heading into the Wisconsin primary, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates by 1,243 to 980. With superdelegates, her lead stood at 1,712 to 1,011. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.Democrats award delegates on a proportional basis, making it hard for Mr. Sanders to cut into her lead short of blowout victories in big states.Preliminary tallies show he shrank Mrs. Clinton's lead by only 60 delegates after winning six of seven contests before Wisconsin.Polling had shown Mr. Sanders with a small lead in Wisconsin. With its liberal tradition and a format that allows independents to vote in the Democratic primary, the state looked like favorable terrain for Mr. Sanders.Clinton aides anticipated a loss and seemed to be focused on New York, which has about three times as many delegates at stake. Mrs. Clinton campaigned up and down the state last week, and after a quick trip to Wisconsinon Saturday, she left and didn't return. As Wisconsin voters cast ballots, Mrs. Clinton appeared at a town-hall style event in Brooklyn withChirlane McCray, wife of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.Mrs. Clinton didn't mention Wisconsin, focusing instead on the next contest and a potential November opponent: Republican Donald Trump.""The fellow who's from New York? I wish he'd get out of one of his towers and actually walk the streets,"" Mrs. Clinton said, addressing a crowd at Brooklyn's Medgar Evers College. ""Peddling prejudice and paranoia is not the New York way.""Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.As in other states, Mr. Sanders drew large, enthusiastic crowds in Wisconsin. He spent election day morning in Milwaukee, having breakfast with the state's former lieutenant governor, Barbara Lawton. Later, he flew to Wyoming for his rally in Laramie.Pat Libecki, 60, who works in a bank, said she voted for Mr. Sanders in Wisconsin.""I think we need a change and I liked his answers to the issues that we're having in this country,"" she said.---Colleen McCain Nelson and Erica Orden contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",5/19/16
"Cruz, Sanders Get Big Wins",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778674932?accountid=12768,"MILWAUKEE -- Both parties' presidential front-runners lost primaries in Wisconsin Tuesday as GOP Sen. Ted Cruz beat Donald Trump and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders bested Hillary Clinton, virtually assuring heated battles all the way to the final primaries in June.The results increase the odds that Republicans will have a contested party convention in July and force Mrs. Clinton to fight longer than anyone expected to clinch her party's nomination.""Tonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry,"" Mr. Cruz told supporters in Milwaukee after he finished ahead of Mr. Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. ""We have a choice, a real choice.""The GOP result was a hard-won victory for anti-Trump forces who had seen the Wisconsin primary as their last, best hope to slow the front-runner's momentum toward the Republican nomination.Mr. Trump's campaign issued a defiant statement, saying Mr. Cruz was a tool of an establishment dead set against him. ""Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet,"" the statement said. ""He is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump.""The Texas senator's victory followed one of the rockiest weeks of Mr. Trump's campaign. Trailing in the polls and under concerted attack from Republican leaders in the state, Mr. Trump also weathered a series of controversies over abortion and other issues that threatened to undercut his standing with women voters.Wisconsin will award its 18 at-large delegates to Mr. Cruz as the statewide winner. He's likely to also win a vast majority of the 24 delegates divided among the state's eight congressional districts, though district-by-district results weren't yet available.Mr. Cruz's strong showing will make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to wrap up the 1,237 delegates needed for the GOP nomination before the primary season ends on June 7, when California allocates the largest number of delegates.Next up on the GOP calendar is the April 19 primary in New York, Mr. Trump's home state, where polls show him with a commanding lead of more than 30 percentage points over Mr. Cruz, who in some surveys runs behind Ohio Gov. John Kasich.New York awards 95 delegates, most of which are allotted proportionately by congressional district. Mr. Trump plans to campaign on Long Island on Wednesday.""Trump has more support than anyone else in New York and always had,"" said state assemblyman Bill Nojay of Pittsford, in north-central New York. ""If the vote was held today, we expect he would win every single congressional district.""A week later, a swath of other East Coast states vote -- Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Mr. Cruz's best hope is in states further ahead in the calendar -- Indiana on May 3 and Nebraska on May 10.Wisconsin -- with its GOP electorate dominated by the kind of working-class, white voters who have been drawn to Mr. Trump elsewhere -- was long seen as fertile ground for the New York businessman. But it turned into a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment.""We have to stop Trump,"" said Mary Czarra, 65 years old, of Menomonee Falls, who voted for Mr. Cruz even though she preferred Mr. Kasich. ""He insulted our governor, for crying out loud. You can't do that if you're a Republican here.""Mr. Cruz was endorsed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, still a hero to the state's conservatives even though his 2016 presidential campaign fizzled.Mr. Trump lambasted Mr. Walker and others in the state party establishment who opposed him, and their assault on the front-runner backfired among voters like Jim White, 62, of Milwaukee.""I see the GOP fighting this guy all the way, and I don't like it,"" Mr. White said. ""My feeling is this is about to destroy a lot of people; they won't vote ever again if Trump loses.""Holding out hope for a come-from-behind victory, Mr. Trump spent the past week stumping across the state, even skipping his grandson's bris Sunday to greet voters at a Milwaukee diner.""He cannot downplay the significance of Wisconsin, because he moved here for the final week,"" said Brian Fraley, a Republican operative based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. ""He went to every corner of the state. He was everywhere and he worked it hard, so he can't say that little Wisconsin didn't mean much. If it didn't mean much, he wouldn't be investing time and energy here.""Wisconsin's primary had been seen as a tough test for Mr. Cruz because he has struggled in other Midwestern industrial states including Michigan and Illinois. Most of his victories over Mr. Trump have come in states that hold caucuses -- time-consuming events that play to his grass-roots organizational strength. Wisconsin's primary also is open to Democrats and independents, not just registered Republicans.Mr. Trump has done better in open primaries, while Mr. Cruz improves where balloting is limited to the party faithful. But with an equally competitive Democratic race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders for their party's nomination, it was unclear if Mr. Trump could pull away cross-party voters.Before Tuesday, Mr. Trump had 737 delegates, Mr. Cruz had 475. Even if Mr. Cruz ended up winning all 42 delegates from Wisconsin, it was unlikely there are enough bound delegates left for him to reach 1,237 before the convention.For Mr. Trump, locking up the nomination during the primary season is possible but increasingly difficult, raising the chances that Republicans will choose their nominee in Cleveland, in a contested convention.Messrs. Cruz and Trump have played down suggestions that another candidate would be nominated if the convention deadlocked, and warned that grass-roots Republicans would rebel if that happened.Mark Meckler, a tea-party activist who hasn't endorsed any candidate, agreed. ""As for the chatter about a contested convention, if neither Cruz nor Trump are the nominee, the Republican Party will end in a fiery crash and Hillary Clinton will be our next president,"" he said. ""Many in the grass-roots movement say they will simply not vote.""The next several primaries are in East Coast states where Republicans are likely to be less receptive to Mr. Cruz's religious, antiestablishment brand of conservatism than they are in Wisconsin.""This is the last state in which Ted Cruz has any ability to win a state through the rest of April, and in some of them, he's going to be fighting for second place,"" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Trump adviser and daughter of former presidential rival Mike Huckabee.In the run-up to Wisconsin, a series of controversies damaged his already-shaky standing among women. He admitted it was a mistake to have retweeted an unflattering photo of Mr. Cruz's wife Heidi. And he offered contradictory responses to questions about the sensitive abortion rights issue.He seemed to be trying to lessen the damage by bringing his wife, Melania, onto the campaign trail on the eve of the Wisconsin primary.Yet his mistakes helped Mr. Cruz pick up the endorsement of the National Right to Life Committee, the leading national antiabortion rights group.After a vote Saturday by its board of directors, the group said: ""Sen. Cruz is the only candidate for president who has always been pro-life, who has a 100% pro-life voting record with National Right to Life, who can win the Republican nomination, and who can defeat pro-abortion Hillary Clinton in November.""In an MSNBC interview Tuesday, Mr. Trump denied the week has reflected badly on his support for women. ""As far as women are concerned, nobody respects women more than I do, not even close,"" he said.---Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Janet Hook and Reid J.

"Trump, Sanders and the Populist Anti-Policy Surge; Washington 'experts' stir many Americans' loathing. Time to put the public back into public policy.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789890763?accountid=12768,"If there's one thing that unites the populist campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it's a desire to put the ""public"" back into ""public policy."" Many Americans apparently feel that policy is something done to them, rather than with them. They disdain the unknown ""experts"" in distant Washington, D.C., who devise everything from trade deals to overtime rules.As the dean of a graduate school in public policy, I've been thinking: Are programs like mine partly responsible for this state of affairs? How should graduates in the Class of 2016 react as they enter a world increasingly skeptical of their expertise?It's true that government has often failed to engage citizens. During a recent conference on land use at Pepperdine, the planning director of a large California city explained it this way: ""The problem is that we always put people up in front of the public who are the least prepared to be there.""Her staff were experts in the technical aspects of their work--from limits on building heights to requirements for setbacks. But she recognized that when her planners met with citizens, who often had different priorities, they were incapable of facilitating productive dialogue. The public simply concluded that the government couldn't--or wouldn't--""listen.""Graduate programs in public policy and public administration have wrestled with this for years. The discipline sends into the field alumni who may be very good at formulating something called ""policy,"" but not so good at understanding the public's role in its creation. ""Large segments of mainstream public administration scholarship,"" Robert F. Durant and Susannah Bruns Ali wrote three years ago in Public Administration Review, ""privilege bureaucratic expertise and marginalize the deliberative role of unorganized interests and citizens in agency deliberations.""The general tendencies of these academic programs toward quantitative knowledge and standardized solutions has created what we see today: from local planners who don't listen, to White House advisers who believe that ObamaCare passed because of the ""stupidity of the American voter.""At Pepperdine, we host a training series titled ""Public Engagement: The Vital Leadership Skill."" More than 1,000 public officials have taken part, learning the basics of facilitating input from citizens. We developed the program about five years ago after realizing that many midcareer public leaders never learned these skills in college and graduate school.Are this generation's successors being taught them? The retirement of the baby boomers will effect one of the greatest changes in public leadership in American history. Now is the time to update these programs to ensure that generational change becomes cultural change.First, we should teach students to think of the public not as a faceless mass, but as actual, individual human beings. ""Modern public administration,"" the great sociologist Robert Nisbet wrote, ""has been generally dominated by the nineteenth-century rationalist's conception of society as a vast aggregate of unconnected political particles."" That was in 1953.Public-policy programs should integrate essential quantitative coursework into a liberal-arts approach. Students should read what the Great Books say about the role of a citizen in a democracy, while studying what the latest social-psychology research shows about the myriad biases people bring to ""fact based"" decision-making. These will help them see that the policy they develop for Rome, Ga., may not work in Rome, N.Y., (or Rome, Italy, for that matter) and that some government services might be better provided by a local nonprofit or through collaboration with the private sector.Second, schools must teach a set of skills--how to facilitate public meetings or publicize them to increase participation. The ""public comment"" process by which local boards and councils usually involve citizens does not succeed at informing either the public or policy makers. In 2013 Pepperdine, working with the League of California Cities, surveyed over 900 public officials . Seventy-six percent said that their public meetings were ""typically dominated by people with narrow agendas.""It's the same phenomenon that played out in the conflagrations known as town halls when ObamaCare was being passed. Citizens came out in force against the bill, but Congress passed it anyway. Some argue that these failed public meetings led to the creation of America's last populist movement: the tea party.Finally, students of public policy should be taught about the role of technology in mediating the relationship between the citizen and his government. A couple of months ago, my hometown of Santa Monica invited me via Facebook to complete an online survey regarding a downtown building project. Tomorrow's public leaders must be prepared to involve and inform residents in ways the private sector has employed for decades--engaging them on social media, or posting budget data online to increase transparency.In the months ahead, thousands of future leaders will be awarded degrees in public policy. Meanwhile, graduate schools should ponder the role they play in American democracy--and how they can respond to the populist moment that is upending politics (and policy) as usual.Mr. Peterson is the dean of the Pepperdine School of Public Policy.Credit: By Pete Peterson",5/20/16
Trump and Bernie: Less Is More; The two 'outsiders' are offering political minimalism because it works in our culture.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789611249?accountid=12768,"If you did a word-association game with people for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it might go like this:Donald Trump: wall, trade, terrific.Bernie Sanders: billionaires, Wall Street, income inequality.With these words, Donald Trump, the host of ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" defeated a platoon of professional Republican politicians and is the party's presumptive nominee.Bernie Sanders, a Vermont socialist, won't be the Democrats' nominee but he has transformed Hillary Clinton into the incredible shrinking heir apparent.As a result, some have asked: What is going on with the American electorate? A follow-up question would be: How have Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders gone so far by offering so little?Everyone gets that these two campaigns are about varieties of anger. But something other than anger is changing America's politics.At the Trump campaign website , five policy positions are listed. Two are ""Pay for the Wall"" and ""Immigration."" Other than trade with China, there is no entry on foreign policy.Sen. Sanders's campaign is essentially variations on several evocative phrases. Liberal analysts have debunked what little detail he has proposed as implausible, notably on health care.And still: political minimalism is a winner in 2016.After meeting with Mr. Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan said, ""Going forward, we're going to go a little deeper in the policy weeds.""But Donald Trump probably thinks weeds are something he hires a gardener to do. Mr. Trump himself said last summer that the details would come ""over the next two or three weeks--probably sometime during September. OK?"" They didn't come.Could it be that these two have read the electorate's zeitgeist correctly? They, especially Mr. Trump, understand that the vapors shaping public sentiment--and ""sentiment"" is the word--have shifted decisively away from a past built, for the most part, on substance and logic.My apologies to the Trump and Sanders supporters who have their support analyzed out to the third decimal point. But not everyone does, nor wants to anymore.Professional politics itself has been transitioning toward more emotive metrics. The most important candidate tests now are ""cares about people like me"" or ""tells it like it is.""All of Mr. Trump's main opponents--Messrs. Bush, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich--were policy wonks. For them, what mattered was hands-on political experience. But the kind of experience in vogue now is more like the elation from attending a mass rally.The Trump-Sanders policy pitch resembles a Rorschach test. They let voters read meanings of their own into immigration, make America great again and the billionaire class. Their rhetoric-only campaigns flip the switch for the already wired.Hillary has tried to be a more rational alternative to Bernie the way all the Republican candidates did with Donald Trump. She's getting hurt for the same reason: At least half the electorate this year isn't into hearing how much she knows about policy.Mrs. Clinton's campaign said this week she planned to call out Mr. Trump on his lack of detail and his contradictions. She might want to consult Aristophanes' ancient Greek comedy ""The Clouds,"" a satire of politicians who overthink.This isn't quite the death of reason, though Stanford's Russ Roberts noted in these pages recently how economists increasingly factor feelings about politics into objective data.How did this happen? My lodestar on these matters is Marshall McLuhan, who wrote presciently in 1967: ""All media works us over completely."" It would be foolish not to recognize that the environment we swim in daily alters everything, not least politics.In the digital world enveloping us now, all you have to know is how to work the interface. Click, and software does the heavy thinking and detail work. Messrs. Trump and Sanders are more in sync with the culture many are most comfortable with.A typical Trump conversation makes minimal linear sense. But most big superhero movies today make no sense either. They're just a lot of quick spurts, jumbled points of view and over-the-top caricatures. Like Donald Trump.Ever notice that quick, ironic Trumpian smile amid his rants? He knows his audience--half serious, half hoot. It works. At the Nevada caucuses last weekend, the Sanders supporters swung from glee to violence. ""Feel the Bern"" is a sensation.The Trump and Sanders phenomena really have more in common with Facebook communities than with the two political parties. Maybe that's the future. Criticizing them, we've all learned, violates the social bond.There have to be professional Democrats who wish they could roll Bernie's new magic voter dice against Donald Trump's this fall.Of course we can't govern this way. The Trump and Sanders electorates are right in their anger about poor wage growth, but it's still going to be a mistake if the next president, elevated out of a culture of sentiment, is incapable of policy execution.This is a presidential campaign for our time. What comes after, the world and its many realities, will still be old school.Write to henninger@wsj.comCredit: By Daniel Henninger",5/20/16
Bernie Sanders Sees Decline in Fundraising Pace; Cash reserves in April slipped under $6 million in race against Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump raised $1.7 million in April,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790175165?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders's cash reserves dropped to less than $6 million in April, thanks to a sharp decline in the campaign's fundraising pace, narrowing his options as he heads into the final primary contests.Mr. Sanders had $5.8 million left in the bank at the end of last month, according to a Federal Election Commission report filed on Friday, about one-fifth of front-runner Hillary Clinton's $30.2 million war chest.Dwindling cash reserves are the result of the Vermont senator's sticking with a heavy rate of spending even as his fundraising dropped precipitously last month, when he raised $20 million less than in March.Mr. Sanders still managed to outraise Mrs. Clinton by $500,000 last month, but he spent about $15 million more than she did.He brought in $26.9 million in April but spent $38.6 million, while she raised $26.4 million and spent $23.9 million. Over the course of the campaign cycle through April, Mr. Sanders's campaign has spent $207 million to Mrs. Clinton's $182 million.A shrinking war chest only adds to Mr. Sanders's problems as he faces the final stretch of the primary.He is hundreds of delegates--both pledged and unpledged--behind Mrs. Clinton, and faces increasing pressure from Democratic Party leaders to dial back his attacks on Mrs. Clinton, or else risk harming her chances against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Mr. Sanders's smaller cash pile will make it more difficult to afford advertising for the final leg of the primary battle. Six states will vote on June 7, including California, which has many expensive media markets.Mr. Sanders and his advisers indicated this past week that he would stay in the race at least until voting concludes in mid-June and will continue pressing his case until the July convention.Already, Philadelphia has approved four demonstration permits in support of Mr. Sanders at the Democratic National Convention--including a large rally planned near the convention's epicenter.As a result of Mr. Sanders's prolific spending, Mrs. Clinton stands in likely the strongest financial position of any candidate in either party as she faces the final days of her primary battle.On top of her campaign fundraising, her allied super PAC, Priorities USA Action , has raised a total of $76 million through April and had $46.7 million left on hand to use against Mr. Trump.The super PAC has also collected an additional $45 million in commitments, or pledges to donate at a future date, a spokesman said.Campaigns and super PACs were required to disclose their April fundraising to the FEC by midnight on Friday.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump raised slightly less last month as he neared the end of his own primary fight, bringing in $1.7 million in April--$1 million less than the previous month. Through the end of last month he raised $13.9 million. Mr. Trump effectively clinched the nomination in the first week of May, after rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich quit the race. The real-estate billionaire had $2.4 million on hand at the end of April.The New York businessman's campaign was still largely self-funded last month, when he lent his campaign another $7.5 million, bringing his total loans to $43.4 million. Mr. Trump said earlier this month that he won't self-fund his general-election campaign, and on Tuesday finalized a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee that will allow donors to write checks of up to $449,400.Mr. Trump's new report showed the businessman reduced his spending last month, paying out $9.3 million, down from $13.7 million the previous month.In March, Mr. Trump dramatically ramped up his spending on field staff, telemarketing and voter-data operations, while doubling his spending on digital consultants and advertising. The 50% increase in his total spending marked a shift for Mr. Trump, who had largely eschewed paid advertising and instead directed his money to pay for his signature ""Make America Great Again'' hats and other merchandise and the cost of travel on the private jets he owns. He didn't begin spending money in earnest on TV ads until January, the month before the first nominating contests.Mr. Trump faces a delicate transition as he pivots to the general election. Having spent months condemning the political class that makes its living running campaigns and mocking former rivals, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, for spending millions of dollars with poor results, Mr. Trump now needs to build up an operation extensive enough to take on Mrs. Clinton in the fall.Coming partly to his rescue will be the RNC, which raised $145 million through the end of April. The RNC has already built extensive operations in swing states and has sophisticated data teams already in place.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comCredit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",5/21/16
"Bernie Isn't Hillary's Problem; Democrats are bashing Sanders, but they should worry more about their presumptive nominee.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790110688?accountid=12768,"As more polls show that Hillary Clinton could lose to Donald Trump, Democratic media and political elites have decided that the problem is--Bernie Sanders. The socialist warhorse has had his campaign fun, but now he and his supporters refuse to slink away quietly into Howard Dean obscurity. Doesn't he know that his persistence is helping Republicans?We'd humbly suggest that these Democrats are looking through the wrong end of the campaign telescope. Bernie's continuing string of victories is the symptom of the political demand for change after eight years of Democratic rule. The real Democratic problems this year are the Obama record and the Clinton candidacy.""I will be the nominee,"" Mrs. Clinton declared this week, and barring an act of God or the FBI director she is no doubt right. Mr. Sanders has a narrow window to get a majority of delegates, even without Mrs. Clinton's overwhelming lead among declared superdelegates. Unlike the GOP establishment, Democratic elites are getting the nominee they have wanted from the beginning.Yet Mr. Sanders continues to win primaries even if he has little chance at the nomination. He has won three of the last four major contests, and he lost Kentucky this week by fewer than 2,000 votes. A major chunk of the Democratic base is showing buyer's remorse at Mrs. Clinton's looming coronation and is encouraging Mr. Sanders to fight to the bitter end. Few Bernistas will vote for Mr. Trump, but some might decide to demonstrate their unhappiness at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia or stay home in November.Democrats can blame themselves for much of this political alienation. President Obama was only too happy to indulge the Occupy Wall Street movement when it served his purposes against Mitt Romney in 2012. He and his fellow Democrats played up resentment against ""the 1%,"" which Mr. Sanders and his voters have decided to take seriously and use as a cudgel against Mrs. Clinton.Democrats are especially sore at Mr. Sanders for the blowup last weekend at the Democratic state convention in Nevada, which included some ugly protest scenes. But most Democrats have also been happy to celebrate the Black Lives Matter movement despite its periodic calls to violence.No less than Mr. Obama praised the group at his recent commencement address at Howard University. ""It's thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you, from Black Twitter to Black Lives Matter, that America's eyes have been opened--white, black, Democrat, Republican--to the real problems, for example, in our criminal justice system,"" Mr. Obama told the graduates.No one should be surprised if this same politics of grievance and confrontation is now being aimed at Democrats too. All the more so when the party's presumptive nominee represents the very heart of the ""rigged"" political system that Mr. Sanders and the progressive left have long been describing.Hillary and Bill Clinton have used politics to become members of the richest 0.1%. She and her husband are walking conflicts of political interest--see the Clinton Foundation and its foreign donors with business before the State Department. And Mrs. Clinton represents big money and Wall Street--see her Goldman Sachs speeches.Above all Mrs. Clinton represents the policy status quo that for seven years has failed to deliver on its central promises of 2008 and 2012. Health-care costs haven't fallen, wages have barely risen, income inequality has worsened, and whites and blacks say that racial tensions have increased. This is the reality that the Sandernistas are implicitly rejecting when they say the system has failed them.Mr. Sanders's supporters are also figuring out that their man might have a better chance of beating Donald Trump than Mrs. Clinton does. Clinton Democrats won't say this explicitly, but they believe that an honest socialist can't win. Yet recent head-to-head polls show Mr. Trump ahead or close to Mrs. Clinton, while Mr. Sanders leads the Republican.The latest Fox News poll shows that Mrs. Clinton is viewed as more corrupt than Mr. Trump, 49% to 37%. She is also now viewed negatively by more of the electorate than is Mr. Trump--61% to 56%. This takes some doing given Mr. Trump's incendiary primary campaign and the continuing doubts about him among millions of Republicans.The 2016 campaign has a long way to go, and Mr. Trump has major vulnerabilities. But as the general election comes into focus, Democrats should wonder if they erred in clearing the nomination path for Mrs. Clinton. It was her turn, they thought. She'd mobilize the party's identity groups as the first woman nominee, and the Clinton political machine would do whatever it takes to win. The reality is that she may be the only Democrat who could lose to Donald Trump.",5/21/16

The Sanders Panic; Democrats are loath to face their real problem.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790076495?accountid=12768,"(Best of the Tube this weekend: Catch us on ""The Journal Editorial Report"" discussing the Democratic panic and the Supreme Court. Fox News Channel, 12:30 p.m. ET Saturday and 3:30 p.m. Sunday.) Sometime this week the signal went out to the liberal media ant colony, and the drones moved in unison to protect their queen. This report is directly from the Hill :As the fallout from last weekend's Nevada Democratic convention spreads, sharply critical pieces about the White House hopeful and his campaign have appeared in progressive outlets such as Mother Jones, Talking Points Memo and Daily Kos within the past 48 hours. . . .The Sanders campaign has also taken hits from progressive CNN contributorSally Kohn , who endorsed the Vermont senator from the stage at a massive rally in New York City just before the Empire State's April primary.Kohn wrote an article published Wednesday for Time magazine that was headlined, ""I felt the Bern but the Bros are extinguishing the flames."" . . .""The one thing I do keep wondering about is what happened to Bernie Sanders,"" writer Kevin Drum opined in Mother Jones. ""Before this campaign, he was a gadfly, he was a critic of the system, and he was a man of strong principles. He still is, but he's also obviously very, very bitter. I wonder if all this was worth it for him?""At Talking Points Memo, Josh Marshall said he had been wrong to think that the ""key driver of toxicity in the Democratic primary race"" had been Sanders's campaign manager, Jeff Weaver. Instead, he wrote, ""it all comes from the very top""--from Sanders himself.Homer nods: Kohn would be a soldier, not a drone.There's more. ""Bernie Sanders is playing a dangerous game,"" warns the Washington Post's Eugene Robinson --whose earlier work helped guide the Internal Revenue Service in suppressing conservative speech: ""If he and his campaign continue their scorched-earth attacks against the Democratic Party, they will succeed in only one thing: electing Donald Trump as president.""""With a scorched-earth campaign against [Hillary] Clinton, Sanders is risking his party's nominee, its coalition, and his message,"" echoed Jamelle Bouie of CBS, writing in Slate. There's that ""scorched earth"" again. These ants are nothing if not unoriginal.One of the few liberal pundits not in a full-blown panic is Jeet Heer of the New Republic. ""There is no reason to panic,"" he insists. ""After all, the Democratic primaries were much nastier in 2008, and yet the party won the White House."" Of course no one remembers that far back, so Heer offers a history lesson:The problem in 2008 was the racial tinge to [Mrs.] Clinton's last-ditch defense: that Obama was a doomed candidate because of his alleged inability to win over white voters. On May 8, she argued that ""I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on,"" and cited an article whose findings she summarized thus: ""Senator Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me."" The contrast between Obama's base of black voters with the ""hard-working"" white Americans supporting Clinton, made on the eve of a primary in West Virginia, carried clear racial overtones. . . .[Mrs.] Clinton's rhetorical strategy of insinuating that Obama was too black to be president was echoed by her campaign. . . . Perhaps the most disturbing comment . . . came from Hillary Clinton herself, who in late May 2008 justified staying in the race by saying, ""We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California."" This came after months of worry that Obama, as the first black candidate with a serious shot at the presidency, would be a target for assassination. Two weeks later, on June 7, she finally suspended her campaign.There's no reason to panic at all. After all, it's not as if the Democrats are about to nominate a candidate with a history of saying racist and disturbing things. Oh, wait. Uh-oh . . . To be sure, nobody will remember the things Mrs. Clinton said in 2008, unless perhaps Trump uses them in a campaign ad. True, Heer just reminded us of them, but who reads the New Republic anymore?The trouble is that Mrs. Clinton is, was and ever will be a dismal candidate. ""The conventional wisdom holds that Trump's astronomically high disapproval numbers should make him unelectable,"" Robinson writes. ""On paper, this should be a cakewalk for any Democrat with a pulse"" (metaphor alert). Of course that's what the Republicans thought, and he dispatched 16 of them.Still, if any Democrat is poorly positioned to beat Trump, Mrs. Clinton is. A new Fox News poll finds that Mrs. Clinton now outperforms Trump on the revulsion scale. As the Weekly Standard's Chris Deaton sums up:The former secretary of state is viewed negatively by 61 percent of registered voters in a new Fox News poll, up from 58 percent in March. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has a 56 percent unfavorable rating--dramatically better than his 65 percent measure in March--and a 41 percent favorable rating, the first time he's cracked 40 percent in that measure. . . .Other highlights from the poll include:* [Mrs.] Clinton is viewed as more corrupt than Trump, 49 percent to 37 percent;* Two-thirds of registered voters think Clinton (71 percent) and Trump (65 percent) will say ""anything to get elected"";* and more registered voters say Trump is a strong leader than they do [Mrs.] Clinton, with 59 percent saying the designation describes Trump and only 49 percent saying it describes [Mrs.] Clinton.If the election were held today, a large number of voters would regard it as a contest between evils--a contest that, according to the poll, Trump would win narrowly, 45% to 42%. Of course voters could come to see one or the other candidate more favorably--likelier Trump than Mrs. Clinton, we'd venture, since they've known her for decades but are still getting used to the idea of him as a politician.A new New York Times poll still has Mrs. Clinton leading Trump, albeit by single digits (47% to 41%). The Times observes that Trump is ""saddled with toxic favorability ratings"" and Mrs. Clinton is ""widely disliked by voters.""That ""toxic"" vs. ""disliked"" is more anthill behavior. From Russell Berman at the Atlantic last week: ""The biggest warning sign for Clinton is that as toxic as Trump has proven for women and minorities, Clinton herself is nearly as disliked by white men.""Meanwhile, you know who's neither toxic nor disliked? Bernie Sanders--even though he's a simple-minded exponent of monstrous ideas. That Times poll has him leading Trump in a hypothetical general-election match-up, 51% to 38%. Even in the Fox poll Sanders is ahead of Trump, 46% to 42%.The Democrats ought to panic--not over Sanders but over Mrs. Clinton. If they want to make Donald Trump president, they could hardly do better than by going up against him with a nominee who makes Richard Nixon look like a Boy Scout and Michael Dukakis like a rock star.Out on a Limb ""Gates: Clinton Showed 'Error in Judgment' on Server""--headline, TheHill.com, May 19What Would We Do Without Experts?

Trump, was not qualified to be president.Asked by CNN's Chris Cuomo whether Mr. Trump was qualified to hold the office they both seek, Mrs. Clinton declared emphatically, ""No.""By what criterion does Mrs. Clinton claim Trump is unqualified? He's definitely over 35 and has lived in the U.S. for well over 14 years. He's neither been impeached, nor has he been elected president twice, nor elected once after serving more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected.So the only possible answer is that Mrs. Clinton has joined what Bernie Sanders calls the Bertha Movement.Follow @jamestaranto on Twitter.Join Fans of Best of the Web Today on Facebook.Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.(Carol Muller helps compile Best of the Web.

Reid Caught in Middle as Sanders-Clinton Tension Escalates; Minority leader is one of the few people in the Senate who has a substantive relationship with Vermont senator,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789890862?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Divisions within the Democratic Party, including the eruption of violence on the part of Bernie Sanders's supporters at a state party convention in Nevada, have thrust Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid into the center of an intraparty brawl in his final months in office.Mr. Reid is trying to defuse the tension stirred up by Mr. Sanders and his supporters in his race with Hillary Clinton, not only because Mr. Reid is a party leader but because he is one of the few people in the Senate who has a substantive relationship with Mr. Sanders.In the episode in Nevada, Mr. Reid's home state, Mr. Sanders's supporters who felt the process was rigged began shouting and throwing chairs. Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, who attended the convention, said she feared for her safety, as did the state party chair, who faced death threats. Both are longtime friends of Mr. Reid's.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Trump Looks to NRA for a Boost* Pro-Trump Super PAC Shows Off List of New Donors* Trump's and Clinton's Negatives Could Prove Tough to LowerDuring a meeting this week where Senate Democrats aired their grievances about Mr. Sanders, Mr. Reid stepped out to take a call from the Vermont senator--who typically doesn't call most senators. Mr. Reid later said that he ""laid out to him what happened in Las Vegas"" and said he was ""hopeful that Sen. Sanders will do the right thing.""Mr. Sanders subsequently put out a statement condemning ""any and all forms of violence,"" but defended his supporters and railed against the process for picking a Democratic nominee.Mr. Reid was furious, complaining that Mr. Sanders had resorted to ""some silly statement"" instead of saying something personally about the turmoil. ""Bernie is better than that,"" Mr. Reid said.By Wednesday, tempers had cooled and Mr. Reid struck a more muted tone. ""We talk more than people know, but we do it in private,"" he said. ""We'll be talking"" more.Mr. Reid is capable of playing tough when it comes to divisive intraparty politics. At a meeting of the Congressional Progressive Caucus this month, he told Rep. Alan Grayson (D., Fla.) he had a low opinion of him and said he wanted Rep. Patrick Murphy (D., Fla.) to win a race for an open Senate seat instead of Mr. Grayson, an aide to Mr. Reid said.Mr. Reid ""wants his sock puppet as the candidate in Florida and he is running a smear campaign against me,"" Mr. Grayson said in an interview this week.But Mr. Reid has to tread more carefully with Mr. Sanders, the Vermont Independent with whom Mr. Reid has spent years developing a relationship. Last Thursday, Mr. Reid talked to Mr. Sanders's wife Jane, and then talked to Mr. Sanders last Friday, an aide to Mr. Reid said.At a media event shortly before Nevada's February presidential caucus, Mrs. Sanders gave Mr. Reid a hug and thanked him for refraining from issuing an endorsement ahead of time, an aide to Mr. Reid said. Mr. Reid waited until after the results were in to endorse Mrs. Clinton.Despite their different roles within the Senate Democratic caucus, the two men can find common ground. Mr. Reid sided with Mr. Sanders when President Barack Obama, early in his presidency, proposed cutting Social Security payments by switching to an alternate method of calculating cost-of-living increases.During the fight over the 2010 health law, Mr. Reid helped Mr. Sanders tuck in billions of dollars for community health centers, prompting Mr. Sanders to vote for the law even though he prefers a universal health care system.The two men both grew up without much money; Mr. Sanders says he came from the lower middle class, while Mr. Reid has said that he was so poor that he learned to swim in the pool of an area brothel. Mr. Reid's phone manners are almost as brusque as Mr. Sanders's; while Mr. Sanders doesn't say hello, Mr. Reid regularly hangs up without saying goodbye.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) said many Democrats are reaching out to Mr. Sanders to try to avoid more damaging ruptures within the party.She said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the only Sanders endorser in the Senate, could help with communications, and that Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ""is somebody who could be very helpful, because clearly she has incredible credibility in the community that's supporting Bernie Sanders.""It remains unclear whether Mr. Reid will play a key role in helping bring the two rivals together, as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) did eight years ago when she hosted Mrs. Clinton and now President Barack Obama in her living room after a bitter primary fight.Ms. Feinstein said she doesn't know who would assume that responsibility now, but said that ""you need to have a solid united front.""One hurdle is that Sanders supporters on Capitol Hill are suspicious of establishment Democrats and convinced they are both blowing the situation out of proportion and not listening to the real concerns of Sanders voters. They are on guard for any signs that Clinton supporters will try to get Mr. Sanders to drop out of the race.""If you want people to come together, you can't say to them, 'We don't want to hear your opinion and we don't want your vote to count,' "" said Mr. Merkley. ""You've got to enable them to participate fully, count their vote, feel like they've been heard, feel like they've been respected.""Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.), the co-chair of the progressive caucus and the first lawmaker to endorse Mr. Sanders, also complained about Mr. Reid, who helped broker a deal in which the parent union of the powerful Culinary Workers Union agreed to let employees get off work so they could vote in February. Union employees turned out heavily at caucus sites on the Las Vegas Strip, helping Mrs. Clinton.""I think he played a big role in helping Hillary win Nevada in the first place,"" Mr. Grijalva said. ""What he did was free up the culinary union to back Hillary.""An aide to Mr. Reid said that because the culinary union didn't endorse in the caucus, his efforts didn't tip the scales either way and were intended to boost turnout, not to help Mrs. Clinton.""If he says he didn't participate, then we'll go with his word,"" Mr. Grijalva said. As for the Tuesday phone call, ""I thought it was good for him to call Bernie. They're colleagues.""Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comCredit: By Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson",5/21/16

The party is going left for a host of reasons: the crash of 2008, economic strain, eight years of President Obama, trends within American culture and education. Hillary Clinton's struggles this year are connected in part to her ideological unreliability, to the sense that she's a generation behind ideologically, that she's got the wrong attitude toward Wall Street and the use of military power. She's old school; we're entering something new.Here's what I suspect is coming whatever happens this year. Just as a portion of Republicans--nobody knows how big--will break from the GOP over Donald Trump, some percentage of Democrats, especially among the affluent will, in the next cycle, start to peel off from their party over its lurch leftward. They will not be at home in a party of smiley-face socialism that threatens to become actual socialism. They will not want the American economy destroyed. They will not be comfortable in a party that supports the most extreme political correctness; they do not want their 10-year-old daughters using transgendered bathrooms with men. They will find themselves increasingly opposed to the political correctness that has swept the universities. They will have increasing qualms about spending $60,000 a year to have their bright, kind children turned into leftist robots.So they will start to split off from the Democrats, and they will find the Republicans who split off in 2016, and together, in 2020 or so, they will attempt to create their own party. It will be pro-growth, moderate on social issues, more or less neoconservative in its foreign policy. It will be smallish but well-heeled. It will try to hold together and grow.That is my prophecy. Everything is in play.I mentioned the strains, shifts and breakage within the Democratic party that you can see right now. Nothing illustrated it like what happened last Saturday in Las Vegas, when a state Democratic Party convention turned violent, with chairs thrown, fists shaken, curses screamed. Sen. Barbara Boxer, longtime California liberal and Clinton supporter, was heckled and booed. She later said she'd feared for her safety. The state Democratic chairwoman reported threats of bodily harm, including a text message that said: ""We know where you live . . . Where your kids go to school/grandkids. We have everything on you.""It doesn't get much uglier than that. At issue, procedures surrounding the delegate-selection process and Sanders supporters' claim that the deck was stacked against them. This was the local expression of a larger national argument over whether the Democratic National Committee and its chairman, Hillary friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz, were, as Donald Trump used to say, rigging the system.After the Vegas melee Mr. Sanders was relatively unrepentant. He blandly said a few days later that he opposes all forms of violence. He told a California rally that the Democratic Party ""can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real social and economic change.""The Democratic divide can be seen in other ways. Dante Chinni of this newspaper took a dive into the demographics of Kentucky, whose primary this week ""shows how deep divisions are within the Democratic Party."" A racially diverse segment, ""located in cities and their surrounding suburbs, is largely behind Mrs. Clinton, while a less-diverse and largely rural part of the party backs Sen. Sanders."" Mrs. Clinton won narrowly, carrying the most populous counties and most of those with the largest African-American populations, Mr. Sanders the least populous and all the least diverse counties. His voters in Kentucky were rural and white, which was true also in Michigan and New York. ""The tensions within the party aren't likely to lessen,"" Mr. Chinni concluded.California votes June 7. A journalist this week speculated in conversation that if Mrs. Clinton underperforms or even loses there, it could be a gift. It will make her desperate. Presuming she goes on to win the nomination, her desperation might prompt her to make Bernie Sanders her vice presidential nominee.Why not? It would hold the party together for this cycle. It would help keep Sanders voters, who often threaten to go elsewhere if Mrs. Clinton is the nominee, in the tent. It would also unsettle Trumpworld. They see Bernie supporters as potential Trump supporters in the general election, and Mr. Sanders as having an appeal that overlaps with their own. They see his outsider mystique and his appeal to the young.Would Mrs. Clinton do it? If it were the only choice, she would. Would he? He hasn't ruled it out. In early May, Mr. Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he was ""focused"" on winning the nomination, and, if he does not succeed, ""we are going to fight as hard as we can"" to make the Democratic platform more ""progressive."" ""Then, after that,"" he said, ""certainly Secretary Clinton and I can sit down and talk and see where we go from there.""Maybe he'd hold Mrs. Clinton hostage on the platform before he would agree to be her vice president. Maybe she'd accept a more left-wing platform to get the vice president she thinks she needs.A Clinton-Sanders ticket would be the oldest presidential ticket in U.S. history, totaling a combined 142 years. You can characterize that as ancient and out of it, or you can see it as mature, experienced. Up against Mr. Trump, the latter might not look so bad.Mr. Trump too is looking for a vice president. I don't understand those who say he should get an attack dog, since he is an attack dog. He doesn't need a dramatic Northeastern governor with a reputation as a bully, he already has a reputation as a bully. Nor do I understand why they say Mr. Trump needs someone exciting. He's quite exciting enough. He doesn't require someone who can help him with the ins and outs of Capitol Hill. That would be nice and come in handy, but it's also the kind of talent he can hire as staff.What he needs is Stable Man or Stable Woman. He needs someone with real and obvious political accomplishment--a longtime senator or, less attractively, a representative, or a governor, preferably a current one. John Kasich says he isn't interested, but maybe he will get interested. Newt Gingrich is on the list, which is understandable in many respects, but he has the same slightly mad quotient as Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump needs ""He's not crazy.""Big ships need ballast to keep the ship upright, to keep it from tipping over when a high wave comes. Ballast is by its nature uninteresting. Mr. Trump needs ballast. He would benefit from a solid, uninteresting running mate.Uninteresting would come as such a relief this year. It would be like the old days, when people were boring.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",5/21/16
Feud Between Sanders and DNC Head Escalates; The senator backs a primary challenger for Wasserman Schultz's House seat,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790309463?accountid=12768,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders escalated his feud Sunday with Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, endorsing her primary challenger and saying she would lose her leadership role if he became president.Mr. Sanders, who has often spoken of political revolution and bristled at Democratic Party procedures, has long had an uneasy relationship with Ms. Wasserman Schultz.Ms. Wasserman Schultz is a U.S. House member from South Florida. Mr. Sanders said on CNN that he supports her primary challenger, law professor and activist Tim Canova. ""Clearly I favor her opponent,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""His views are much closer to mine than to Wasserman Schultz's.""The Sanders campaign also sent a fundraising message urging his supporters to split a contribution between his campaign and Mr. Canova's. ""He is someone you can be proud to support,"" wrote Mr. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver.Ms. Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that her constituents know how hard she fights for them. ""Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary,"" she said.Mr. Sanders also said he wouldn't reappoint Ms. Wasserman Schultz if he becomes president. He said on CBS that he likes her personally but added, ""Do I think she is the kind of chair the Democratic Party needs? I don't.""Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, in her own appearance on NBC, said Mr. Sanders hadn't been thoroughly tested in the primaries, and that this affected his chances of defeating presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. ""I don't think he's had a single negative ad ever run against him, and that's fine,"" Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Sanders. ""But we know what we're going into, and we understand what it's going to take to win in the fall.""Mr. Canova served on an advisory board Mr. Sanders established in 2011 on reforming the Federal Reserve, and he took part in the Occupy Wall Street movement. One of his campaign positions takes aim at ""the rigged economic and political systems that put Wall Street and multinational corporations first while leaving ordinary Americans behind,"" language similar to that used by Mr. Sanders.Before the current campaign, Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, spent his political career as an independent rather than a Democrat.A low-level conflict between the Sanders camp and Ms. Wasserman Schultz began early in his candidacy. His supporters argued the party was holding too few debates, and that this helped Mrs. Clinton, with her greater name recognition.Mr. Sanders also complains regularly that so many of the Democratic state primaries have been closed, meaning only registered Democrats can participate; he has done better when independents and Republicans can also vote. And he's criticized the notion of superdelegates, high-ranking Democratic Party officials who help choose the nominee.Ms. Wasserman Schultz, for her part, voiced concern about events at the recent Nevada Democratic state convention, where Sanders supporters became unruly and reportedly threatened the state party chairwoman.The Sanders campaign issued a statement after the convention saying in part: ""Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals.""Write to Naftali Bendavid at naftali.bendavid@wsj.com and Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.comCredit: By Naftali Bendavid and Damian Paletta",5/23/16
"Bernie Isn't Hillary's Problem; Democrats are bashing Sanders, but they should worry more about their presumptive nominee.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790180811?accountid=12768,"As more polls show that Hillary Clinton could lose to Donald Trump, Democratic media and political elites have decided that the problem is--Bernie Sanders. The socialist warhorse has had his campaign fun, but now he and his supporters refuse to slink away quietly into Howard Dean obscurity. Doesn't he know that his persistence is helping Republicans?We'd humbly suggest that these Democrats are looking through the wrong end of the campaign telescope. Bernie's continuing string of victories is the symptom of the political demand for change after eight years of Democratic rule. The real Democratic problems this year are the Obama record and the Clinton candidacy.""I will be the nominee,"" Mrs. Clinton declared this week, and barring an act of God or the FBI director she is no doubt right. Mr. Sanders has a narrow window to get a majority of delegates, even without Mrs. Clinton's overwhelming lead among declared superdelegates. Unlike the GOP establishment, Democratic elites are getting the nominee they have wanted from the beginning.Yet Mr. Sanders continues to win primaries even if he has little chance at the nomination. He has won three of the last four major contests, and he lost Kentucky this week by fewer than 2,000 votes. A major chunk of the Democratic base is showing buyer's remorse at Mrs. Clinton's looming coronation and is encouraging Mr. Sanders to fight to the bitter end. Few Bernistas will vote for Mr. Trump, but some might decide to demonstrate their unhappiness at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia or stay home in November.Democrats can blame themselves for much of this political alienation. President Obama was only too happy to indulge the Occupy Wall Street movement when it served his purposes against Mitt Romney in 2012. He and his fellow Democrats played up resentment against ""the 1%,"" which Mr. Sanders and his voters have decided to take seriously and use as a cudgel against Mrs. Clinton.Democrats are especially sore at Mr. Sanders for the blowup last weekend at the Democratic state convention in Nevada, which included some ugly protest scenes. But most Democrats have also been happy to celebrate the Black Lives Matter movement despite its periodic calls to violence.No less than Mr. Obama praised the group at his recent commencement address at Howard University. ""It's thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you, from Black Twitter to Black Lives Matter, that America's eyes have been opened--white, black, Democrat, Republican--to the real problems, for example, in our criminal justice system,"" Mr. Obama told the graduates.No one should be surprised if this same politics of grievance and confrontation is now being aimed at Democrats too. All the more so when the party's presumptive nominee represents the very heart of the ""rigged"" political system that Mr. Sanders and the progressive left have long been describing.Hillary and Bill Clinton have used politics to become members of the richest 0.1%. She and her husband are walking conflicts of political interest--see the Clinton Foundation and its foreign donors with business before the State Department. And Mrs. Clinton represents big money and Wall Street--see her Goldman Sachs speeches.Above all Mrs. Clinton represents the policy status quo that for seven years has failed to deliver on its central promises of 2008 and 2012. Health-care costs haven't fallen, wages have barely risen, income inequality has worsened, and whites and blacks say that racial tensions have increased. This is the reality that the Sandernistas are implicitly rejecting when they say the system has failed them.Mr. Sanders's supporters are also figuring out that their man might have a better chance of beating Donald Trump than Mrs. Clinton does. Clinton Democrats won't say this explicitly, but they believe that an honest socialist can't win. Yet recent head-to-head polls show Mr. Trump ahead of or close to Mrs. Clinton, while Mr. Sanders leads the Republican.The latest Fox News poll shows that Mrs. Clinton is viewed as more corrupt than Mr. Trump, 49% to 37%. She is also now viewed negatively by more of the electorate than is Mr. Trump--61% to 56%. This takes some doing given Mr. Trump's incendiary primary campaign and the continuing doubts about him among millions of Republicans.The 2016 campaign has a long way to go, and Mr. Trump has major vulnerabilities. But as the general election comes into focus, Democrats should wonder if they erred in clearing the nomination path for Mrs. Clinton. It was her turn, they thought. She'd mobilize the party's identity groups as the first woman nominee, and the Clinton political machine would do whatever it takes to win. The reality is that she may be the only Democrat who could lose to Donald Trump.",5/23/16
Hillary Clinton Tries to Consolidate Support of Democratic Base; Front-runner makes her case to labor groups and woos Bernie Sanders backers,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790525287?accountid=12768,"With the Democratic nomination in reach, Hillary Clinton is taking steps to consolidate support in the party's base by rallying labor groups to her campaign and wooing backers of her primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders.Mrs. Clinton, who is just 90 delegates short of primary victory, is counting on organized labor to bring manpower and money to her White House bid as she pivots to the general-election campaign.She appeared before the Service Employees International Union's convention in Detroit on Monday, and she will continue to make her case Thursday when she addresses a United Food & Commercial Workers International Union conference in Las Vegas.Also Monday, the Democratic National Committee ensured Mr. Sanders's backers will have enough representatives on a key committee to influence the drafting of the party's platform at the July convention in Philadelphia, meeting one of their chief demands.In a statement, Mr. Sanders said the DNC move will produce a ""platform that reflects the views of millions of our supporters.""Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Poll: Democrats Say Long Primary Helps Their Party* Trump Narrows Gap With Clinton, Poll Shows* Clinton Still Favored Despite Trump Narrowing Poll Gap* Donald Trump Lags Behind in Organizing Key States* Feud Between Sanders and DNC Head Escalates* Trump Defends His National Security Positions as Hillary Clinton Attacks* Donald Trump Is Closing the Deal With Republican ElitesMrs. Clinton's comments and the DNC action come as polls show her lead over presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump narrowing significantly, and as the New York businessman does his own spade work to consolidate support among the conservative Republican base.He spoke Friday at a forum hosted by the political arm of the National Rifle Association, locking down the group's endorsement and pledging to protect the Second Amendment. Mr. Trump also released last week the names of 11 possible candidates for the Supreme Court, a move aimed at easing concerns about his conservative credentials.A new Wall Street Journal /NBC News poll finds a tightening race with Mrs. Clinton now leading Mr. Trump by just 3 percentage points. A merge of WSJ/NBC News polls from the first four months of 2016 also shows that white union households are split evenly between the two parties' likely nominees, with each candidate garnering 44% support.Mrs. Clinton on Monday cast herself as a reliable ally of organized labor as she attacked Mr. Trump's policies and sought to bridge the divide with Mr. Sanders's supporters. The former secretary of state told union members that ""your fights are my fights"" and offered repeated reminders that Mr. Trump said during the primary campaign that wages were ""too high."" More recently, Mr. Trump has voiced support for raising the minimum wage.""Trump economics is a recipe for lower wages, fewer jobs, more debt,"" Mrs. Clinton said Monday. ""He could bankrupt America like he's bankrupted his companies.""While Mrs. Clinton generally has enjoyed strong support from organized labor, she still has work to do to ensure that labor unions coalesce around her candidacy.The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions, so far has declined to endorse a candidate during the primary campaign. Mr. Sanders has won fervent support from a several labor unions. And Mr. Trump has proved to be popular with white, working-class voters, a bloc that overlaps substantially with union members.While labor officials say it is worrisome that Mrs. Clinton's lead over Mr. Trump has been narrowing in recent polls, they say she hasn't had a chance to consolidate Democrats behind her the way Mr. Trump has been able to with Republicans.""It's not helpful at this point that this is dragging on,"" said Steve Rosenthal, a Democratic strategist and former political director for the AFL-CIO. ""It's going to be really critical to bring the party together,"" he said, and Mr. Sanders is going to be ""central to that.""Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, said Mr. Trump already has begun bringing once-skeptical Republicans to his campaign. ""There's still consolidation that's yet to occur on our side,"" he added.Union officials in interviews said Mrs. Clinton has hit most of the right notes on issues that matter to organized labor such as wages and trade. Still, some say she could take a stronger stand against trade agreements and Wall Street practices that union members see as threats to their jobs or communities.""She's got to make it unequivocally clear that she will not support the TPP in any form,"" said Robert Master, the Eastern region political director for the Communications Workers of America, a union that has endorsed Mr. Sanders, referring to the Pacific trade deal.Another possible negative for Mrs. Clinton: Her lack of commitment to a federal $15 minimum wage. Supporting $15 has ""become a kind of symbol about what you are willing to do about inequality,"" Mr. Master said.Others say Mrs. Clinton has a broader challenge, along with the entire Democratic Party.""I think really what has to be made clear is who is the base,"" and it is the same 99% of Americans Mr. Sanders is fighting for, said Larry Hanley, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which also endorsed Mr. Sanders. He added that his union will support Mrs. Clinton if she becomes the nominee.Unions have seen their membership rosters drop sharply over the past few decades. In 2015, just 6.7% of private-sector U.S. workers were union members, compared with about 15% 30 years ago. Still, unions have significant influence on how and whether their members and union-household members vote, getting them out the door by visiting their homes, handing out leaflets and sending social-media messages during election cycles.Mr. Fallon said Mrs. Clinton wouldn't take for granted the votes of rank-and-file union members, adding that organized labor would play a critical role in building a nationwide, grass-roots campaign.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which backs Mrs. Clinton, said she had no doubt that U.S. workers would support Mrs. Clinton and come to see Mr. Trump as a ""scam artist"" who would damage the economy.""After what has been a spirited Democratic primary about how to raise wages and break down barriers to ensure our economy and democracy work for all, the Democratic base will unite behind Hillary, just like 25 unions already have, and just like she did in 2008"" behind then-Sen. Barack Obama, she said.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Melanie Trottman at melanie.trottman@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Melanie Trottman",5/24/16
Waddell & Reed CEO Henry Herrmann to Retire; Chief Investment Officer Philip Sanders to take the helm at investment firm,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790520765?accountid=12768,"Waddell & Reed Financial Inc.'s longtime chief executive intends to retire Aug. 1, marking the second recent high-ranking retirement at the investment firm.""I believe now is the time for the next generation to move the company forward,"" Chief Executive Henry J. Herrmann said in a news release.The 73-year-old, who joined Waddell & Reed in 1971 as a senior investment analyst covering the technology industry and was named CEO in 2005, will remain as non-executive chairman, the firm said. He will be succeeded as chief executive by Chief Investment Officer Philip J. Sanders, 56.Mr. Sanders, who will continue to serve as chief investment officer, joined Waddell & Reed in 1998 as a portfolio manager.In February, Kansas-based Waddell & Reed said Michael L. Avery, president and portfolio manager of the firm's largest mutual fund, Ivy Asset Strategy Fund, would retire June 30 . Assets in the fund have fallen to $10.3 billion at the end of March, from a peak of $36 billion two years earlier.Founded in 1937, Waddell & Reed has suffered in recent years from a combination of poor performance at some of its best-known funds, investor withdrawals and a broad shift in investor taste towards passive funds that track the performance of indexes.Analysts have said the money manager is among those likely to be hit hardest by new Labor Department rules that are likely to push investors towards lower cost funds including index funds and exchange-traded products.In its most recent quarterly report, Waddell & Reed said it would cut its workforce by about 10% as part of a cost-reduction effort.Assets under management at the firm fell to $95.2 billion at the end of March from $122.9 billion a year earlier.The company's stock closed Monday at $20.05, down 30% so far this year.Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com and Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse@wsj.comCredit: By Maria Armental and Sarah Krouse",5/24/16
Hillary Clinton's Complicated Path to the Center; Opening among moderates is blocked by Bernie Sanders and ideologically liberal Democrats,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790478002?accountid=12768,"Let's deploy a football metaphor to describe one of Hillary Clinton's dilemmas: There is a great opening for her in the ideological center of the presidential playing field. But right now she is trapped in the backfield by Sen. Bernie Sanders and his supporters, and it's unclear she can break free to seize the opening.This may be one of the biggest prices Mrs. Clinton is paying for the continuing challenge posed by Mr. Sanders. By pushing her to the ideological left and making clear he will make her pay a price if she doesn't keep pointed that direction, he is standing in the way of her moving toward what should be a natural constituency in the center, and one that Donald Trump may be making more available than usual.In the normal order of affairs, a presidential candidate tacks to the left in Democratic primaries or to the right in Republican primaries to win over each party's ideological activists and win the nomination. Then a nominee moves subtly back toward the center to broaden his or her appeal to the general-election crowd.In some ways, Mr. Trump is having to do the opposite. He has sewn up the Republican nomination, but now finds that he has to reassure his party's suspicious conservatives to pull them into line behind him. So in the past week or so he actually has moved to the right, pleasing social conservatives by offering a list of conservative judges he would consider for appointment to the Supreme Court and making a full-throated appeal for gun rights before the National Rifle Association.That leaves an opening for Mrs. Clinton in the place where she ought to have strong support anyway: among moderates in the political center.This is where she probably belongs, logically. She is heiress to the Bill Clinton center-left ideology and coalition. She wants an increase in the minimum wage but not a giant increase. She wants to raise taxes on the wealthy but not as much as liberals would like. She favors government activism but proposes ways to pay for it. She is more willing to intervene abroad than is President Barack Obama.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Poll: Democrats Say Long Primary Helps Their Party* Trump Narrows Gap With Clinton, Poll Shows* Donald Trump Lags Behind in Organizing Key States* Feud Between Sanders and DNC Head Escalates* Trump Defends His National Security Positions as Hillary Clinton Attacks* Donald Trump Is Closing the Deal With Republican ElitesMoreover, she has been reasonably friendly to the business community, which is under attack from both sides and available for the wooing.So the opening is there, particularly because 57% of self-described moderates hold a negative view of Mr. Trump in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll , as do a third of ""soft"" Republicans. More than most groups surveyed, moderates said they are looking for a president with a steady approach rather than one who will bring great change. That sounds like Mrs. Clinton.But it isn't that easy. Not by a long shot.Mrs. Clinton is trapped at the moment defending her left flank against continuing attacks from Mr. Sanders, and that figures to be the case right up until the Democratic convention at the end of July. So to the extent she moves to the center, she risks losing her already-tenuous hold on Sanders voters. She will need those liberal Sanders voters at least as badly--perhaps more badly--than she will need moderates in a general-election matchup against Mr. Trump.Moreover, any shifts in position Mrs. Clinton makes as the campaign goes on will risk exacerbating her broader problem, which is that many voters don't see her as honest and trustworthy. That is a potential trap.Heading toward that trap, Mrs. Clinton would find that her standing in the political center isn't as strong as one might expect, given her background and profile. Among political moderates, she leads Mr. Trump by a mere 2 percentage points, 45% to 43%. By contrast, Mr. Obama won moderates by 15 percentage points over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, exit polls indicated.Mr. Sanders actually does better among moderates in a hypothetical matchup against Mr. Trump than does Mrs. Clinton, a head-scratching finding if there ever was one.Six in 10 of those moderates supporting Mrs. Clinton say they actually are opposing Mr. Trump more than supporting her. By a 53% to 32% margin, moderates say they have negative feelings toward Mrs. Clinton personally.The upshot is that Mrs. Clinton faces competing and contradictory needs. She has to up her appeal among moderates, which should be a natural base of support. Yet she also may find herself in the same kind of position as does Mr. Trump, having to reassure her party's ideological base to ensure its active support despite having won the nomination.In sum, the opportunity here is very real for Mrs. Clinton. But so is the danger that she ends up in a kind of no-man's-land ideologically, not fully pleasing either those on the left or those in the center.Write to Gerald F.

"Bernie and the Cut-the-Military Brigade; U.S. defense spending as a share of GDP is modest, but you wouldn't know it from critics who distort reality.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790264641?accountid=12768,"The U.S. Marine Corps recently revealed that 70% of its F/A-18 jet fighters aren't flight-worthy. For years military leaders have warned that their budgets are insufficient. But when they request increases, the anti-defense crowd claims military spending is more than adequate, citing comparisons with other nations or previous eras. These arguments are specious.Bernie Sanders says the U.S. spends more on defense than the ""next nine countries combined."" The correct number is actually six, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute . Last year Washington spent $596 billion. No. 2 was China at $215 billion. No. 3 was Russia at $91 billion. You might hear lower numbers--$145 billion for Beijing and $66 billion for Moscow--but these are misleading. China's official figures don't include several spending categories, such as arms imports. The lower Russian number is its 2015 budget at 2015's exchange rate. That rate plummeted in 2014, but Russia pays for its military in rubles so the 2014 rate better represents the country's military funding.Therefore, in 2015 the U.S. spent a little under twice what its two ""near-peer"" adversaries spent. That might be plenty, if China and Russia were America's only national-security threats and located nearby. But the U.S. is also fighting jihadists with thousands of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and with dozens of drones and special-operations teams throughout the Middle East--while also contending with Iran and North Korea.Another tactic of the anti-defense crowd is to emphasize the 41% growth in military spending since 9/11. The fact is 2001's spending, as a percentage of GDP, was at a historically low 2.9%, compared with 34.5% during World War II, 11.7% during the Korean War, 8.9% during Vietnam and 6% during the Reagan presidency. Even at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, defense spending reached only 4.7%. In 2015 it was back down to 3.3%.U.S. defense spending has grown 41% since Sept. 10, 2001. But in that time Russia and China have increased spending by 267% and terrorists brought down the World Trade Center. Perhaps 41% isn't enough. A little-noted fact: The 2015 budget was $120 billion less than planned. In 2010 the Defense Department projected the 2015 base budget--the portion that doesn't cover current wars--at $616 billion. Instead, it was $496 billion. Had the 2010 plan held, defense spending would have been 4% of GDP last year.But isn't defense spending driving the budget deficit? Not really. Defense as a percentage of federal spending is also at a post-World War II low. It accounted for 16% in 2015, 25% under Reagan, 50% under Eisenhower and over 80% during World War II.

Election 2016: Sanders Ups Anti-Clinton Rhetoric --- Senator says his rival's husband's presidency imposed hardships on African-Americans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779827997?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- A new rift in the Democratic race has opened up, with Bernie Sanders making the case that Bill Clinton's two-term presidency was harmful to the African-American voters who are among the most loyal groups in the Clinton family's political base.The Vermont senator is vying to win over African-American voters in advance of the April 19 New York primary, and is seizing on a dust-up last week between the husband of his rival, Hillary Clinton, and a pair of protesters over crime and social-welfare policies dating to the 1990s.Mr. Sanders's campaign also released a new TV ad produced by movie director Spike Lee that will air soon in New York. The ad features entertainer Harry Belafonte and civil-rights activists vouching for Mr. Sanders as someone sensitive to the struggles of racial and religious minorities.Targeting Mr. Clinton carries certain perils. Polls show the 42nd president is popular among Democrats, and he enjoyed a particular bond with African-Americans during his time in office. And Mrs. Clinton has, in the primaries so far, carried overwhelming majorities of the African-American vote.But racial politics are shifting, breaking along similar generational lines that have left Mrs. Clinton garnering more support from older women voters than younger ones.Both of the Clintons have been on the defensive over tough-on-crime policies enacted when he was president. Hoping to expand his coalition, Mr. Sanders is advancing the argument that the Clinton presidential years imposed certain hardships on African-Americans.In the exchange with protesters in Philadelphia on Thursday, Mr. Clinton defended his wife's use of the term ""super predator"" in a 1996 speech as an apt description for gang leaders preying on black neighborhoods. (She has apologized in the past for using the term.) Mr. Clinton also sought to justify signing a welfare overhaul that same year that imposed new work requirements and limitations on federal assistance.Speaking at a campaign event at the Apollo Theater in Harlem over the weekend, Mr. Sanders called on Mr. Clinton to apologize for defending her use of the term.When someone in the audience at the Apollo shouted that the ""super predator"" reference was code for ""black people,"" Mr. Sanders said: ""That's exactly right.""Mr. Sanders was unsparing in his criticism of the welfare legislation, casting it as a cynical ploy to win votes. ""Do you all remember that?"" he asked the audience. ""The premise, which was a right-wing Republican premise, was that the problem was all these people were really living high off the hog."" A consequence of the new law, he said, was that ""extreme poverty . . . went up.""Asked about the welfare law Sundayfollowing a rally in Queens, Mr. Clinton said: ""There's no question, as every independent analysis has shown, it led to a big drop in poverty. It's just that the people who were left should never have been abandoned, but it happened essentially after I left office.""No candidate wants a surrogate to dominate the discussion. But Mr. Clinton has always cast a large shadow. Stumping on her behalf he routinely talks up her credentials, but he is also eager to discuss his own record, presenting it as a model for helping people improve their financial condition.---Erica Orden contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",5/24/16
Hillary Clinton Seeks Momentum in California Race; Democratic front-runner focuses on Donald Trump as Bernie Sanders campaigns hard in Golden State,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791186584?accountid=12768,"RIVERSIDE, Calif.--Hillary Clinton is seeking to close out a surprisingly contentious presidential primary with a victory here that would send her into the general election with momentum and mute Democratic rival Bernie Sanders's argument that she's a weak front-runner.""I need your help in this upcoming primary because we want to finish strong,"" Mrs. Clinton told supporters Tuesday at a rally here. ""We want to send that message that we are going to fight every day.""Both candidates are working hard for the 475 delegates at stake in the June 7 primary in California. There are also contests in five other states, and barring a total collapse, Mrs. Clinton is likely to capture enough delegates that night to claim the presidential nomination, possibly before the polls close in the Golden State.Confident in her position, Mrs. Clinton declined to participate in a final debate and she ignored questions about a State Department report released Wednesday that found her private email system violated agency policies.But a new poll released Wednesday by the Public Policy Institute of California found the candidates in a statistical tie, with 46% of likely Democratic primary voters and 44% preferring Mr. Sanders. Earlier polling had Mrs. Clinton ahead.Her campaign said late Wednesday that it would start airing TV ads in three markets, a ""six-figure"" buy and a proposition her campaign had hoped to avoid. It also appears to be running an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation. It has nine field offices, and an aide said phone banks in seven languages and door-to-door visits have been under way for two weeks.Mrs. Clinton has also pressed her advantage with party leaders. Elected officials at every level, union leaders, women's rights activists and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, all have headlined events. On Wednesday, she was introduced by actress Jamie Lee Curtis.The state should set up well for Mrs. Clinton. She easily won the 2008 primary. That year, nearly half the electorate was nonwhite, and she has done well with minority voters this year.At rallies, Mrs. Clinton doesn't even mention Mr. Sanders, focusing instead on the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump. On Wednesday in Buena Vista, she said the money he wants to spend on a border wall with Mexico could pay for 16 Golden Gate Bridges or 1,500 new elementary schools. She also hit him for comments ahead of the housing crisis that appeared to be rooting for prices to fall, saying he could make a lot of money.""A good result in Donald Trump's world is he gets his and you get hurt,"" she said.But even as Mrs. Clinton looks to the fall, many of her backers remain uneasy with Mr. Sanders's continued presence in the race.""He should just stop,"" Conni Lira, 70 years old, of Pico Rivera, who saw Mrs. Clinton at a union organizing event Tuesday. ""He's just making it more difficult for her when he doesn't have a chance.""Mr. Sanders isn't going away. He has 17 rallies planned or completed over an 11-day stretch. He projects he will have spoken to 200,000 people by June 7. He has four field offices and 80 paid workers.Mr. Sanders has already spent about a half-million dollars on satellite-TV ads, which can be carefully targeted, according to tracking by Kantar Media CMAG. The campaign says it has bought $1.5 million on its new buy.Mr. Sanders released a new TV ad this week that urges voters to think beyond the nomination contest itself to what has become a broader effort to transform the Democratic Party. The unspoken message is that a Sanders vote isn't wasted, even if he can't win.""What choice do Californians have in this election?"" Mr. Sanders asks in the ad. ""The biggest one of all: You have the power to choose a new direction for the Democratic Party.""As Mr. Sanders campaigned in recent days in liberal strongholds of California, he drew crowds of thousands; his supporters treat him like a rock star, chanting his name.At a rally in San Jose, supporters stood for hours in a dusty state fairground to hear the hoarse-voiced candidate speak. He mixed in mentions of local issues, such as one likely to be on the California ballot this fall.""If I lived in California, I would vote 'yes' to legalize marijuana,'' he said, drawing loud cheers from the mostly young audience.He has also endorsed a California ballot initiative designed to control prescription-drug prices by restricting the amount state agencies could pay for them.His campaign also has been bumpy. Some staff have recently departed, and his last finance report showed the campaign running short of money.But he has built a grass-roots operation aimed at tapping into the enthusiasm that runs strong for him and his cause.

The Sandernista Rebellion Heats Up; Bernie's allies at the convention will include Bill McKibben and Cornel West. This should be interesting.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791149251?accountid=12768,"As the Democratic presidential race winds down, the question may not be what Sen. Bernie Sanders wants that his party can give him. It may be what he wants that he knows he won't get. The Vermonter seems less concerned with uniting the Democratic Party than transforming it.With 930 delegates yet to be chosen, Hillary Clinton is a mere 78 away from a convention majority. Mr. Sanders must understand by now that he won't be the nominee. But if his goal is to move the Democratic Party further left, it is logical to ask for concessions that the convention will likely refuse, such as extreme additions to the party platform. This would give his supporters an animating cause for years to come.The Sandernistas are already in a fighting mood. On May 14 the Nevada Democratic state convention dissolved into chaos after some Sanders delegates were kept from being seated. This resulted in Mrs. Clinton's taking seven of the 12 national delegates that were up for grabs. A near-riot ensued, with Mr. Sanders's supporters trashing the hall and threatening party officials.Last Saturday, Mr. Sanders upped the ante by endorsing the primary challenger to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. Other Democratic candidates who feel the Bern openly identify with the Vermonter's challenge to the party establishment. Most are long-shots but their actions suggest growing discontent.Team Bernie is playing hardball over the party's platform, purportedly objecting to the appointment of former Rep. Barney Frank as chairman of the Resolutions Committee, calling him insufficiently liberal. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings was selected instead.The Sanders camp also demanded slots on the 15-person drafting committee that will come up with the party's recommended platform. This committee is traditionally appointed by the DNC chair--in this case, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. At the direction of the Clinton camp, however, she allowed Mr. Sanders to name five panel members.Team Clinton was offered six, while Ms. Wasserman Schultz retained four appointments for herself. Given that the chairwoman is a close Hillary ally, Team Clinton will control the drafting panel--but what an ideologically rambunctious bunch Mr. Sanders has picked.First there's Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, who last year explained his opposition to Donald Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslim visitors to the U.S. by saying ""I don't want my country to become a fascist state.""Then there's environmental extremist Bill McKibben, who once wrote that economic growth ""may be the one big habit we finally must break"" and recently said ""it would be almost impossible"" for Democratic policies on global warming ""to go 'far enough.' ""Prof. Cornel West, another Sanders appointee, once said that President Barack Obama ""posed as a progressive and turned out to be counterfeit"" and mocked him as a ""brown-faced Clinton"" who has ""a certain fear of free black men.""James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute, has called Israelis ""Nazis"" and accused the Jewish state of carrying out a ""Holocaust"" against Palestinians, according to the Washington Free Beacon.Mr. Sanders said his goal is to promote debate and that drawing up the platform would be an ""excellent time to educate the American people."" What is at stake, he continued, is the transformation of the party: ""If they make the right choice and open the doors to working-class people and young people and create the kind of dynamism that the Democratic Party needs, it's going to be messy.""That may be an understatement. Sanders supporters have acquired permits for demonstrations across the street from the Democrats' meeting hall in Philadelphia. The city expects as many as 30,000 protesters in FDR Park each day of the convention. ""Even if Hillary does win the nomination,"" an organizer told this newspaper, ""the movement has already started.""When he finally loses the nomination, Mr. Sanders will oppose the Republican candidate, but Mr. Trump's defeat may no longer be the Vermont senator's principal goal. He and his true believers--the 2.7 million people, 42% younger than 40, who have contributed $212 million to his campaign--may not be happy until the Democratic Party becomes genuinely socialist. They seek the path to that intraparty conflict.The night the primaries started, the 74-year-old self-proclaimed democratic socialist said, ""What Iowa has begun tonight is a political revolution."" Bernie Sanders wants that to be more than rhetoric.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",5/27/16
"Bernie Sanders Fights to Oust Two Hillary Clinton Backers From Key Convention Posts; While Democratic National Committee says it sees no reason to strip Barney Frank or Dannel Malloy of their positions, aide says Vermont senator will keep trying",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792295963?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders is fighting to oust two Hillary Clinton supporters heading key Democratic National Convention committees, despite the party's refusal to remove them, in the latest sign of disunity amid a bitter fight for the presidential nomination.An attorney for Mr. Sanders's campaign sent a letter to Democratic National Committee officials on Friday asking them to disqualify former congressman Barney Frank and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who are co-chairmen of the convention's rules and platform committees, respectively.Brad Deutsch, counsel to the Sanders campaign, wrote that Messrs. Frank and Malloy are loyal Clinton allies who can't be relied on to run their committees dispassionately. He asked that they be removed from their positions or, alternatively, that the DNC conduct a hearing that would assess their fitness to serve.On Saturday, however, the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee's co-chairs sent a reply dismissing the complaint. They wrote that Messrs. Frank and Malloy had been elected by the DNC's executive committee in January. No party rules were violated in that election, meaning there was no cause to strip the two men of their titles, their letter said.After the DNC committee announced it's rejection of the complaint and said it was retaining Messrs. Frank and Malloy, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said: ""This doesn't settle anything. We will raise the same serious issues when the committees convene"" at the convention.In his letter, Mr. Deutsch cited news accounts in which both Messrs. Frank and Malloy criticized Mr. Sanders and depicted him as the inferior candidate. One newspaper article cited in the letter included a remark critical of Mr. Sanders that Mr. Frank made in 1991, when Mr. Sanders was a freshman congressman from Vermont.""Both Gov. Malloy and Mr. Frank have been harsh, vocal critics of Sen. Sanders and equally active supporters of his challenger, Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Deutsch wrote.He added: ""Their criticisms of Sen. Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign. The chairs therefore cannot be relied upon to perform their convention duties fairly and capably while laboring under such deeply held bias.""Mr. Sanders has conceded he faces a difficult path to the nomination. With so-called superdelegates added to the mix, Mrs. Clinton leads by 2,310 delegates to 1,542. A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination.Apart from closing the gap and wresting the nomination from Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders wants an influential role at the convention. He hopes to shape the party platform so it reflects some of his policy goals, including a $15 minimum wage and a single-payer, government-run health-care system. And he wants to adopt changes that would limit the power of superdelegates and open up future presidential nominating contests to more voters.Mr. Frank, a former Massachusetts congressman, said in an interview Saturday that he would be able to remain neutral as co-chair of the rules committee. Should there be any issue before the committee that bears on Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Sanders becoming the nominee, Mr. Frank said he would recuse himself.Mr. Frank noted that in the 2000s, he traveled to Burlington, Vermont at Mr. Sanders's request and took part in a fundraising event for his then-congressional colleague.Still, he made clear he isn't impressed with Mr. Sanders's record in the House and Senate. ""We believe that Sen. Sanders's approach to how you bring about progressive change is mistaken,"" Mr. Frank said. ""He's arguing in part that he will be a more effective change agent and that's relevant. The fact is that he has not been a very effective change agent in 25 years in Congress, and that seems to be relevant to voters in deciding who to support.""A larger concern, Mr. Frank added, is that Mr. Sanders, by arguing the convention committees are tilted in Mrs. Clinton's favor, is unfairly feeding perceptions that he is being robbed of the nomination.To the extent that his supporters buy that argument, it could be tougher for Democrats to unify the party in advance of the showdown with the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump.""What troubles me is that he and some of his people are trying to build a story that when he doesn't get the nomination that he was somehow unfairly deprived of it,"" Mr. Frank said. ""It's nonsense. She's got more pledged delegates, she's won more contests and she has millions of more votes.""A spokesman for Mr. Malloy also couldn't be reached.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",5/29/16
Hillary Clinton Cancels N.J. Event to Campaign in California; Campaign seeks to avoid embarrassing loss to Bernie Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792433816?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on Monday canceled an event in New Jersey to spend more time campaigning in California this week ahead of the June 7 primary , hoping to avoid an embarrassing defeat to rival Bernie Sanders, who has barnstormed the Golden State.Mrs. Clinton had been scheduled to campaign in New Jersey on Wednesday and Thursday. Her campaign said Monday that instead, on Thursday she would begin a five-day California swing. Some recent polls have found the race nearly tied, though others put her ahead.The former secretary of state has a commanding lead and will probably win enough delegates to secure the nomination before the polls close in California, where 475 delegates are at stake.

"Donald Trump Hopes for Boost From Bernie Sanders Supporters; Presumptive Republican nominee counting on Vermont senator's backers to shift to him, but poll numbers indicate otherwise",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792354242?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, surveying the next phase of his Republican presidential campaign, is counting on a boost from an untapped well of disenchanted voters who hate the status quo, think the system is ""rigged"" against them and can't stand Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.That would be supporters of Bernie Sanders.More Election Coverage at Capital Journal* Donald Trump Raised $6 Million in First Joint Fundraiser With RNC (May 27)* Bernie Sanders Tries to Oust Two Hillary Clinton Backers From Key Convention Posts (May 28)* Video: Trump's Game Plan: Put 15 States in Play (May 28)""I'm hearing we're going to get close to 40% of his supporters,"" Mr. Trump said during a recent campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M. ""The system is rigged against Bernie, so he can't win"" in the Democratic presidential primary. ""We're going to get tremendous numbers from Bernie Sanders.""But that prediction is a stretch and would require an extraordinary amount of persuasion to execute, if recent opinion polls and interviews with Sanders backers are any indication.""That's absurd,"" said Frank Pringle, 32 years old, a law student in Richmond, Calif., at a Sanders rally. ""He is living in a fantasy world.""Frank Gamboa, 39, an Uber driver from Alameda who supports Mr. Sanders, is struggling with his general-election options but said, ""I cannot in good conscience vote for Trump.""In Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls over the first four months of this year, just 6% of Sanders supporters felt positively about Mr. Trump, while 90% felt negatively. Faced with a Trump-Clinton choice in the general election, 10% of Sanders supporters would vote for Mr. Trump, 81% would vote for Mrs. Clinton.The May Journal/NBC poll suggests that Mrs. Clinton could be losing ground; it found just 66% of Sanders supporters would vote for her against Mr. Trump, while 17% would vote for Mr. Trump.Yet, if Mr. Trump wants to woo Sanders supporters, he will face the formidable obstacle of the Vermont senator's own virulent opposition to his candidacy and calls for his backers to resist the temptation of Mr. Trump.""Donald Trump represents a whole lot that I passionately hate,"" Mr. Sanders said in an MSNBC interview this month. ""If I'm not the candidate, I will do everything that I can to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States.""Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, concedes ""there are some things in common. There is a lot of frustration with Washington and people are angry."" But he added: ""It's a matter of channeling that anger in a constructive way that has been a big part of the appeal for Sen. Sanders.""The surprising rise of these two populist candidates has been a remarkable feature of the unpredictable 2016 campaign, inviting comparisons between their appeals to angry voters.But the roots and goals of the Trump and Sanders phenomena are drastically different. Trump voters' anger is closely linked to frustration with the GOP elites, and they tend to want government to dial back its role in social and economic problem solving. Sanders voters tend to think government should be more, not less, active in solving those problems.""The little guy has been getting left out in the cold my entire life,"" said Joe Marshall, 35, a Sanders supporter who works at the Joshua School for autistic children in Englewood, Colo. ""I happen to have more faith in the government's power to affect positive change in the world than a Donald Trump supporter would.""Mr. Trump's attitude toward Mr. Sanders has been a moving target. He has coined the derisive nickname ""Crazy Bernie."" He has jokingly agreed to debate Mr. Sanders--and then reneged on the suggestion on Friday.He sometimes argues that Mr. Sanders should run as an independent candidate. But more often than not, he seems to be wooing the senator's voters and treats Mr. Sanders with a gentler touch than he does other rivals.""I have to give him credit,"" Mr. Trump said in Albuquerque. ""Crazy Bernie is out there trying, and he's trying hard. Hillary cannot even put Bernie away.""The Trump message may fall on more receptive ears among Sanders supporters whose antipathy toward Mrs. Clinton runs especially deep. Jordan Honeycutt, a 24-year-old unemployed laborer in Kannapolis, N.C., said he would reluctantly pull the lever for Mr. Trump if he is the only alternative to Mrs. Clinton.""Anything but Clinton,"" Mr. Honeycutt said. ""There isn't anything about Trump I like much, and I'm scared he will bankrupt the country as he did his businesses. But I would be on that bandwagon. I do believe if Trump becomes president, I do think you will see more jobs opening up. He is a businessman.""Mr. Trump is counting on the power of the trade issue to speak across party lines.""Bernie Sanders and I have one thing in common: trade,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview. ""He knows we are getting ripped off and so do I. The difference is I can make great trade deals. He wouldn't know where to begin.""Mr. Trump predicted that he would get ""tremendous"" support from millennials, the young voters who are a major bastion of Sanders voters. But the latest Journal/NBC News poll casts doubt on that prediction. Just 20% of voters aged 18 to 34 expressed positive feelings about Mr. Trump, while 71% felt unfavorably. In a head-to-head contest between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, he draws 32% of 18- to 34-year-olds, while she gets 55%.Mr. Sanders, who wasn't available for an interview, has rejected any comparison with Mr. Trump and his stump speech includes a resolute slap at the New York businessman.""I know there are many people who are concerned that Donald Trump may become president of the United States,"" he said in San Jose last week. ""That will not happen.""His supporters erupted into boos when a plane flew over a California rally with a banner inviting them to turn to Mr. Trump: ""Bernie's Done. Vote Trump.""Mr. Trump will have a hard time winning over voters such as Mr. Gamboa, a Mexican-American who is so dedicated to Sanders campaign that he stuck with an Uber-driving job so he would have the time and flexibility to work as a volunteer.He is unhappy enough with the status quo to be tempted to support Mr. Trump if it comes down to at Trump-Clinton face off, but he is turned off by some of the provocative things he has said about immigration and his worries about the Supreme Court in a Trump presidency.""I'm battling with it,"" Mr. Gamboa said. ""If it weren't for the Supreme Court, I probably would vote for Trump.

Dannel Malloy, who are co-chairmen of the convention's rules and platform committees, respectively.Brad Deutsch, counsel to the Sanders campaign, wrote that Messrs. Frank and Malloy are loyal Clinton allies who can't be relied on to run their committees dispassionately. He asked that they be removed from their positions or, alternatively, that the DNC conduct a hearing that would assess their fitness to serve.On Saturday, however, the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee's co-chairs sent a reply dismissing the complaint. They wrote that Messrs. Frank and Malloy had been elected by the DNC's executive committee in January. No party rules were violated in that election, meaning there was no cause to strip the two men of their titles, their letter said.After the DNC committee announced it's rejection of the complaint and said it was retaining Messrs. Frank and Malloy, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said: ""This doesn't settle anything. We will raise the same serious issues when the committees convene"" at the convention.In his letter, Mr. Deutsch cited news accounts in which both Messrs. Frank and Malloy criticized Mr. Sanders and depicted him as the inferior candidate. One newspaper article cited in the letter included a remark critical of Mr. Sanders that Mr. Frank made in 1991, when Mr. Sanders was a freshman congressman from Vermont.""Both Gov. Malloy and Mr. Frank have been harsh, vocal critics of Sen. Sanders and equally active supporters of his challenger, Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Deutsch wrote.He added: ""Their criticisms of Sen. Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign. The chairs therefore cannot be relied upon to perform their convention duties fairly and capably while laboring under such deeply held bias.""Mr. Sanders has conceded he faces a difficult path to the nomination. With so-called superdelegates added to the mix, Mrs. Clinton leads by 2,310 delegates to 1,542. A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination.Apart from closing the gap and wresting the nomination from Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders wants an influential role at the convention. He hopes to shape the party platform so it reflects some of his policy goals, including a $15 minimum wage and a single-payer, government-run health-care system. And he wants to adopt changes that would limit the power of superdelegates and open up future presidential nominating contests to more voters.Mr. Frank, a former Massachusetts congressman, said in an interview Saturday that he would be able to remain neutral as co-chair of the rules committee. Should there be any issue before the committee that bears on Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Sanders becoming the nominee, Mr. Frank said he would recuse himself.Mr. Frank noted that in the 2000s, he traveled to Burlington, Vermont at Mr. Sanders's request and took part in a fundraising event for his then-congressional colleague.Still, he made clear he isn't impressed with Mr. Sanders's record in the House and Senate. ""We believe that Sen. Sanders's approach to how you bring about progressive change is mistaken,"" Mr. Frank said. ""He's arguing in part that he will be a more effective change agent and that's relevant. The fact is that he has not been a very effective change agent in 25 years in Congress, and that seems to be relevant to voters in deciding who to support.""A larger concern, Mr. Frank added, is that Mr. Sanders, by arguing the convention committees are tilted in Mrs. Clinton's favor, is unfairly feeding perceptions that he is being robbed of the nomination.To the extent that his supporters buy that argument, it could be tougher for Democrats to unify the party in advance of the showdown with the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump.""What troubles me is that he and some of his people are trying to build a story that when he doesn't get the nomination that he was somehow unfairly deprived of it,"" Mr. Frank said. ""It's nonsense. She's got more pledged delegates, she's won more contests and she has millions of more votes.""A spokesman for Mr. Malloy also couldn't be reached.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",5/31/16
Democrats vs. Israel; Sanders puts two hostile voices on the party's platform committee.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792074084?accountid=12768,"Not too long ago Democrats were America's pro-Israel party. Harry Truman recognized Israel moments after the Jewish state declared independence in 1948. JFK sold advanced anti-aircraft missiles to Jerusalem, ending a de facto U.S. arms embargo. Bill Clinton was famously close to the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.If that party isn't dead, it's close. This week Bernie Sanders named James Zogby of the Arab-American Institute and professor Cornel West to the party's platform-drafting committee. The pair are expected to push hard for a more ""even-handed"" position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which in practice means denouncing Israel at every turn.Mr. West offered a flavor of his even-handedness on Facebook in 2014 during Israel's last war with Hamas. ""Let us not be deceived,"" he wrote. ""The Israeli massacre of innocent Palestinians, especially the precious children, is a crime against humanity! The rockets of Hamas indeed are morally wrong and politically ineffective--but these crimes pale in the face of the U.S. supported Israeli slaughters of innocent civilians.""Mr. Zogby has prominently endorsed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, calling it ""a legitimate and moral response to Israeli policy."" BDS has gained steam in recent years on college campuses, where Palestinian victimology plays well and students are easily misled about the causes of the Arab-Israeli conflict.These views go well beyond the usual bounds of fair criticism of Israel. No other country--including a genuine occupier like China in Tibet--is being singled out for boycotts the way Israel is. The suggestion that Israel deliberately ""massacres"" innocent Palestinians is false based on everything we know about Israel's military restraint and war practices. If Palestinians wanted to end Israel's occupation, they could have taken the deal offered to them at Camp David in 2000 when Bill Clinton was President.Pro-Israel Democrats might reply that Messrs. West and Zogby are only two of a 15-person panel, and Hillary Clinton has taken a more mainstream line. But there's no gainsaying the increasingly anti-Israel tilt of progressive politics. A Pew poll from April found that while moderate Democrats still sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians by a 53% to 19% margin, self-identified liberal Democrats now tilt to the Palestinians, 40% to 33%.Even Mrs. Clinton is only moderate on Israel when compared to the Democratic left. Her State Department was notorious for its denunciations of Israel, and some of her closest advisers are often quicker to denounce Israeli self-defense than Palestinian terror.The shame of all this is that support for a robust liberal democracy like Israel should come naturally to the Democratic Party. Last we checked, it was better to be a woman, or homosexual, or environmentalist, or political dissident in Tel Aviv than in Gaza. As they write their party's platform, Democrats might ask why Israel, the one Middle Eastern country that fully shares their values, should be the one they most seek to condemn.",5/31/16
California Gov. Jerry Brown Endorses Hillary Clinton; Statement notes Clinton's 'insurmountable' lead over rival Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792659081?accountid=12768,"Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, dwelling less on her credentials for the job than on the need to stop Republican Donald Trump.Mr. Brown, a popular governor who ran against Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential race, said he would vote for Mrs. Clinton in next Tuesday's California primary. He also praised her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying Mr. Sanders's focus on income inequality echoed his own message in the 1992 race.In a statement, Mr. Brown recited the Democratic primary vote and delegate totals that have vaulted Mrs. Clinton to what he described as an ""insurmountable"" lead. Democrats, he wrote, have shown ""that they want her as their nominee.""""This is no time for Democrats to keep fighting each other,"" Mr. Brown said. ""The general election has already begun. Hillary Clinton, with her long experience, especially as secretary of state, has a firm grasp of the issues and will be prepared to lead our country on Day One.""Mr. Brown criticized Mr. Trump's positions on climate change, citing past comments in which Mr. Trump referred to global warming as a ""hoax."" He also faulted Mr. Trump for calling for the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and for saying that more allies should acquire nuclear weapons so that the U.S. doesn't have to shoulder so much of the cost.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are competing hard in California, a reliable blue state and a lucrative source of campaign cash for the Democratic Party. A Sanders victory isn't likely to erase Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead, but it would give him renewed confidence to carry the fight to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July.Mr. Sanders's supporters would likely use a California victory to make the case to Democratic superdelegates that Mrs. Clinton is a flawed front-runner who would have difficulty beating Mr. Trump.For those reasons, Mrs. Clinton is spending precious time and campaign dollars in California. Her campaign cut short a planned two-day swing in New Jersey--which also holds a primary on June 7--so that she could spend more time stumping in California before the election.With Mr. Brown enjoying a high approval rating in the nation's largest state, his endorsement has the potential to make a difference.He said Mrs. Clinton ""has convincingly made the case that she knows how to get things done and has the tenacity and skill to advance the Democratic agenda,"" and that her nomination ""is the only path forward to win the presidency and stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump.""Credit: By Peter Nicholas",6/1/16
"Hillary Clinton Holds 2-Point Lead Ahead of California Primary, Poll Finds; Outcome on June 7 could give Sanders confidence to carry campaign to party's convention",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792846562?accountid=12768,"Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are deadlocked in California ahead of next week's high-stakes primary, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll shows, raising the prospect of a surprise outcome that would give Mr. Sanders confidence to carry his campaign into the party's convention next month.Mrs. Clinton leads the Vermont senator by just 2 percentage points among likely Democratic primary voters, 49% to 47%, well within the survey's margin of error. The poll signals a closer contest than expected just weeks ago.The fate of Mr. Sanders's presidential bid rides heavily on the outcome in California--the last major contest of the primary season and the one that awards the most delegates.Mrs. Clinton can win enough delegates on June 7, when six states hold nominating contests, to claim the Democratic nomination, without winning the primary in California. She essentially has the nomination, thanks to the support of superdelegates, who can switch their allegiance at any time.Mr. Sanders has been campaigning in California every day since May 21, hoping to build his vote total to bolster his argument to superdelegates ahead of the July nominating convention that he is the party's stronger candidate.A win in California could also strengthen Mr. Sanders's hand in pushing for the party platform to better reflect his liberal agenda.At the least, a Clinton loss in California would cast a long shadow over her campaign as she seeks to unify the Democratic Party after an unexpectedly competitive--and divisive--primary process. In particular, Mrs. Clinton needs to make inroads among the younger voters who have fueled Mr. Sanders's campaign.""We are seeing a familiar pattern in what is the last major preconvention collision between Clinton and Sanders,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ""Age is the story in this California tossup. Sanders inspires younger or first-time voters, and Clinton relies upon those who are older or have participated in the past.""Among Democratic primary voters age 18 to 29, the poll found, 80% favor Mr. Sanders, while Mrs. Clinton garners almost twice his support among primary voters age 45 and older. Mr. Sanders also outpaces the Democratic front-runner by a wide margin, 72% to 28%, among those voters who would be participating for the first time.The good news for Mrs. Clinton is that it looks like she has already banked a larger share of the early vote. She leads among Californians who have already cast ballots, 58% to 41%. She also beats Mr. Sanders in the state's two biggest urban centers, the Bay Area and Los Angeles County.Mr. Sanders holds a slight lead, 49% to 46%, among Latino voters, who account for more than a quarter of likely Democratic primary voters.The poll casts doubt on Mr. Trump's recent claim that he will make California competitive in the general election. Mrs. Clinton leads the presumptive Republican nominee by 24 percentage points, 55% to 31%, with 6% undecided, and 8% saying they wouldn't vote for either. Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump by an even wider margin, 62% to 28%, with 10% saying they were either undecided or not supportive of either.In the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, Democrat Kamala Harris, the state's attorney general, leads the field as the preferred pick of 37% of primary voters. U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, is in a solid second place, with 19%.California's open primary system allows the top two finishers in next week's primary to advance to the general election.California is one of six states to hold Democratic nominating contests on June 7, along with Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. The District of Columbia will officially close out the primary season the following week when it holds its contest on June 14.The poll of 557 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted May 29-31 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor and Peter Nicholas",6/2/16
Bernie the Economic Warrior; Sanders scores a choice seat as he contemplates basketball inequality.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792639856?accountid=12768,"The Golden State Warriors rallied to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder in game seven of the NBA western conference finals Monday, and among the celebrities on hand was Bernie Sanders. Even politicians deserve an occasional respite from politics--though the Vermont socialist couldn't resist a political allusion of his own.""The Warriors were down 3-1 and they turned it around and I think that that's what we're going to do too. A very good omen for our campaign,"" Mr. Sanders said, according to the pool report. He'll take anything he can get ahead of the California primary next week, though for now his induction into Dub Nation raises some questions about his conception of economic justice.To wit, does Mr. Sanders consider Oakland's Oracle Arena a monument to the corporate greed he so often decries? Why was he cheering, rather than occupying? Isn't the minimum wage spelled out in Steph Curry's four-year, $44 million contract an outrage when income inequality is growing? Is it right that the team that scores the most points wins, rather than redistributing points equally?Then there's Mr. Sanders's unearned privilege to sit in the 15th row behind the Thunder basket, with the actor Danny Glover (""Lethal Weapon"" 1-4). The pool reporter, Joe Garofoli of the San Francisco Chronicle, joked that Mr. Sanders scored ""good seats but not the ones frequented by millionaires and billionaires.""Maybe so, but ESPN reveals that list prices for tickets averaged $960, and tickets near Mr. Sanders's section were trading on the secondary market between $1,650 and $1,750. Courtside floor seats a few rows ahead were going for as much as $58,000 a pair.That small fortune could almost pay for a year of debt-free tuition at an elite university. Contra Mr. Garofoli, it's reasonable to conclude Mr. Sanders sat among the 1% he otherwise says need to be held accountable, and presumably he doesn't mean for Mr. Glover's movies ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" and ""Dirty Grandpa.""Ethics rules prohibit Senators from accepting gifts valued over $100, with an exception for gifts over $250 from personal friends with written permission. If the campaign purchased or reimbursed the ticket for the candidate, that's a lot of $27 contributions. Perhaps Mr. Sanders should clarify exactly which type of money he wants out of politics.",6/2/16
Panama Bernie,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778927852?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders caused the Panama Papers. Bernie of Vermont didn't do it by himself, of course. The world's most famous socialist, and Hillary Clinton's albatross, had a lot of help. Spare me the crocodile tears over the immorality of tax avoidance. Panama is an indictment of government greed.After World War II, the governments of the West established tax regimes to support the reconstruction of their nations. Six decades later, that tax machinery, which runs the social-welfare states in the countries Bernie Sanders cites in every campaign stop as a model for America, has run totally amok -- an unaccountable, devouring monster. Billionaires aren't the only ones who run from it.Most governments, including ours, overtax their citizens to feed their own insatiable need for money. Then the legal thieves running the government and their cronies, unwilling to abide the tax levels they created, move their wealth offshore to places like Panama. Arguably, all the world's people should be able to move their assets ""offshore"" to escape governments that are smothering economic life and growth, which has stalled in the U.S., Europe and Asia.Speaking of crocodile tears, Barack Obama spent Tuesday bragging that corporate tax inversions are akin to Panama Papers' tax avoidance. Mr. Obama said ""corporations,"" another swearword invoked by Bernie Sanders at every stop, are ""gaming the system.""Well what about that ""system?"" Mr. Obama is saying, with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in his echo chamber, that U.S. corporations should suck it up on the U.S.'s 35% corporate tax rate, the world's developed highest, and simply send that money to him. Why? Because he's gotta have it. To spend.Other than their national health-care systems, many of which are effectively bankrupt, most Europeans would be hard put to explain what it is their high-tax governments actually do with their money.Suppressed for generations by high tax rates and regulatory minutiae, most Europeans survive in an economic half-life of gray and black markets, with their assets protected by cash-only transactions, bartering, and endless hours devising off-the-books deals involving family real estate, inflated art prices and anything else they can hide from the taxman. The Beatles actually wrote a song about it in 1966 -- ""Taxman,"" a grim ode to all this.Governments with unsated ""needs"" for revenue exist in Europe, Africa, Russia and South America. The Associated Press this week reported that in Russia today shell companies exist simply to pay the bribes that are the price of daily life.One way or another, most people living in the countries run on the Obama-Sanders-Clinton model eventually go searching for their own private Panama. When private capital is under public assault, it will hide. From the wealthiest to the poorest, it creates a world of chiselers, not productive citizens.Sen. Sanders gave his Wisconsin victory speech in Laramie, Wyo., backgrounded by the smiling, bobbing heads of his 20-something voter base. In Western Europe, which is Sanders Land, those 20-somethings are the subject of a permanent economic discipline called high youth unemployment.The Sanders campaign isn't about idealism. It's about the misallocation of capital. ""Misallocation of capital"" is a phrase utterly alien to socialists, and increasingly to most of the modern Democratic Party.In the now-extinct Democratic Party -- the party of Hubert Humphrey, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton -- room existed for the private sector to breathe. Not yet unhinged completely from economics, Democrats understood the symbiosis between healthy private production and public revenues. Both Presidents Carter and Clinton deregulated economic life.No longer. The deconstructed party of Barack Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and forced-recruit Hillary Clinton says: Just keep squeezing them.This week marked a historic moment in the Democratic drift toward low-growth Euro-socialism. Both California and New York raised the minimum wage to $15. California Gov. Jerry Brown, who in his career has been every Democrat that ever was, summarized the true meaning of the new party. ""Economically, minimum wages may not make sense,"" he said, but they make sense ""morally, socially and politically.""It has been my view for some time that to help her navigate Bernie's new Democratic world Hillary Clinton should bring in Lady Gaga as a consultant. An expert in magic realism.Sen. Sanders is getting mocked now by Hillary Clinton and her supporters for a catastrophic interview he gave this week to the New York Daily News, revealing he knows little about his own proposals. But France's Socialist President Francois Hollande knew everything about his economic proposals. What difference does it make?The day before losing to Bernie Sanders in Wisconsin, Mrs. Clinton argued: ""I think we need a nominee who's been tested and vetted already. For 25 years they've thrown everything they could at me, but I'm still standing.""Tested, vetted and still standing. On the available evidence so far, that isn't this year's criteria for the American presidency.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",6/2/16
Election 2016: Sanders Outlines Plan on Big Banks,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778926834?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders's awkward explanation of how he would break up the nation's biggest banks reverberated on the campaign trail Wednesday, with his Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton chiding him for a hazy plan.""He hadn't done his homework and he'd been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn't really studied or understood,"" Mrs. Clinton said on MSNBC Wednesday, a day after Mr. Sanders trounced her in the Wisconsin primary.The Vermont senator's full interview with the New York Daily News, however, shows he offered a clearer vision than the political backlash suggests.Much of the criticism has centered on an exchange in which he was repeatedly questioned about the authority the government could use to pare down the biggest banks. Mr. Sanders said a bill he introduced in May 2015 would give the Treasury secretary authority to break up big banks but leave it up to the institutions to figure out how to restructure.""It is their decision as to what they want to do and how they want to reconfigure themselves,"" Mr. Sanders said during the April 1interview, which was publicly releasedon Monday. ""That's not my decision.""Under his plan, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, headed by the Treasury secretary, would have 90 days to compile a list of banks deemed to be too-big-to-fail. The list would automatically include institutions like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley, a point he reiterated during the interview. The firms are among the eight identified as institutions that could pose a threat to the financial stability of the nation.After drawing up the list, the Treasury secretary, in consultation with the firm's regulator, would have one year to make sure the banks break themselves up so that a failure wouldn't require a taxpayer bailout to avoid a big blow to the U.S. or global economy.Mr. Sanders's proposal differs from the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law in two significant ways. His plan would give the authority to break up the banks directly to the administration through the Treasury secretary, and it leaves the decision on how to break up the banks to the institutions themselves, not the Federal Reserve.Today, that power rests with the Fed, which can start the breakup process only after a number of triggers.For starters, the Dodd-Frank law calls on the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to force banks with $50 billion or more in assets to draw up credible bankruptcy plans, or ""living wills."" Failing to write a reliable plan opens the way for regulators to cap the size of the firm or limit its activities.Results of those living wills, which will serve as a litmus test, are expected to be released soon. Both the Fed and the FDIC are assessing which big banks drafted credible plans.The banks could also be required to slim down if the FSOC, now headed by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, identifies a firm as systemically important. If the council's 10 voting members -- mostly heads of regulatory agencies -- decide that is the case, a firm is placed under the Fed's supervision, and its size or activities could be limited.But last week's ruling by a federal district judge upending FSOC's designation of MetLife Inc. as ""systemically important"" puts a legal question mark over the council's authority, especially when it comes to big insurers.Notwithstanding the court challenge, the council has the power to break up an institution if it decides by a majority vote that the firm presents a ""grave threat"" to financial stability -- a power the council has yet to exert.Credit: By Donna Borak",6/2/16
"California Liberals Await the Bernie Effect; Sanders could boost liberal Democrats in down-ballot races, pulling the state even further leftward.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793454426?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders is hoping to pull off an upset victory over Hillary Clinton in California's June 7 presidential primary, buttressing his argument to Democratic superdelegates--now in the favorite's pocket--that Mrs. Clinton isn't too big to fail. But even if Mr. Sanders loses on Tuesday, he could be a winner for California's liberal politicians: The self-described socialist is expected to turn out masses of young people, and that could be a boon for down-ballot left-wing candidates for the state legislature.In heavily Democratic California, the party's primary is when most legislative contests are decided, and those can hinge on a few hundred votes. Despite California's open primary, in which the top two finishers regardless of their party face each other in November, it's unlikely that two Democrats will emerge unless there's very low Republican turnout. The Sanders effect could give Democrats a supermajority in Sacramento, pulling the party--and the state--even further to the left than it already is.Public unions, liberal groups, government reformers and businesses are wading into the primary in a big way. Because of term limits, there are six Senate (of 40) and 16 Assembly seats (of 80) open. The goal of many working to influence the primary is to shift the moderate-liberal balance of power in the Democratic caucus, since the Republican minority is usually irrelevant except for close votes to block tax increases.Consider the 27th Assembly-district race in Silicon Valley, where six Democrats and one Republican are on the primary ballot. The general election is unlikely to be competitive since Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by more than two to one.The leading Democratic contenders are Madison Nguyen and Ash Kalra, both of whom have recently served on the San Jose city council. In 2012, Ms. Nguyen supported sweeping public-pension reforms--which Mr. Kalra complains ""eroded employee morale and created the most toxic labor-management relationship in the city's history."" Labor groups have endorsed Mr. Kalra, while Ms. Nguyen enjoys support from government reformers, like former mayor Chuck Reed, who hope to elect more moderate Democrats to the legislature.In an overlapping Senate district, oil companies have spent $340,000 backing a challenge by term-limited Democratic Assembly member Nora Campos to unseat incumbent Jim Beall. Ms. Campos was one of 21 Democratic Assembly members (most representing middle and low-income communities) who helped defeat a sweeping climate-change bill last year that would have given the California Air Resources Board plenary authority to cut statewide gas consumption by 50%. Ms. Campos recently said: ""I always think about real-world impacts from the legislation we pass,"" a sentiment not shared by many Democrats in Sacramento. Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer has spent $500,000 supporting Mr. Beall.In the 11th Senate district, San Francisco supervisors Jane Kim and Scott Wiener are sparring over ""quality of life"" issues. Ms. Kim, a former Green Party member who was recently endorsed by Bernie Sanders, supports a ""Right to Rest"" bill in the legislature that would bar police from clearing homeless encampments. She also wants to restrict tech-company shuttle buses that ferry employees around town and have stirred resentment in some quarters. Considered a pro-business moderate in San Francisco, Mr. Wiener opposes both proposals.The Democratic supervisors also differed on a pair of local referendums last fall that would have imposed a building moratorium on market-rate condos in San Francisco's Mission District and limited short-term apartment rentals through startups like Airbnb. Both referendums failed despite Ms. Kim's backing.In the Central Coast 30th Assembly district, public unions, nearly all Democratic statewide officers and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon are backing Karina Cervantez Alejo, the wife of term-limited Assembly member Luis Alejo, who is known as a good friend to labor. In wine country's third Senate district, public unions are bankrolling Mariko Yamada, who supports free community-college education and a ban on foods including genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. Ms. Yamada's main contender is Democratic assembly member Bill Dodd, a former Republican.In these and other races, liberal candidates may benefit from the Sanders campaign. The senator's supporters have been holding voter-registration drives throughout the Bay Area, including at medical marijuana shops, farmers markets and college campuses. Last month, analytics firm Political Data reported that new voter registration in California during the first four months of this year is at its highest since 1980. Nearly half of newly registered voters are Democrats; just 16.7% are Republicans. Two-thirds are under age 35, and about 30% are Hispanic.These trends suggest that the primary electorate will be more liberal than usual, a good sign for Democrats. The party needs only to pick up one Senate and two Assembly seats to reclaim the supermajority that Democrats briefly held in 2013 before three senators were separately indicted on charges of corruption and fraud. (Two have since been convicted.) Fair warning to California voters who also pay taxes: This time around, thanks to Bernie Sanders, a Democratic supermajority would likely be much more liberal than the last one.Ms. Finley is an editorial writer for the Journal.Credit: By Allysia Finley",6/3/16

Because pledged delegates are awarded proportionate to the vote, Mrs. Clinton can lose the California primary and others on June 7 and still win the final delegates she needs to clinch the presidential nomination.Currently, Mrs. Clinton has 2,312 delegates, or 71 short of the 2,383 needed, according to the Associated Press's tally. Mr. Sanders has 1,545, or 838 short of a majority of convention delegates. Nearly 700 delegates will be allocated on June 7, including 475 pledged delegates from California.Recent polls in California have produced widely varying pictures of the Democratic race, with some finding Mrs. Clinton holding a double-digit lead. Voter preferences may be changing as the election nears, accounting for the differing results.The fate of Mr. Sanders's presidential bid rides heavily on the outcome in California, the last major contest of the primary season. The Vermont senator has underscored the importance of the state by campaigning in California every day since May 21.A win in California would bolster Mr. Sanders's argument to the superdelegates, who could switch their allegiance, that he is the party's stronger candidate. It could also strengthen Mr. Sanders's hand in pushing for a party platform that better reflects his liberal agenda.As the contest shifts to the general election, a Clinton loss in California would cast a shadow over her campaign while she tries to unify the Democratic Party after an unexpectedly competitive--and divisive--primary process. In particular, Mrs. Clinton needs to make inroads among the younger voters and independent voters who have fueled Mr. Sanders's campaign, some of whom might back presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton will be in San Diego to deliver a speech that is expected to challenge the foreign-policy positions laid out by Mr. Trump. On the trail recently, Mrs. Clinton has directed her fire at Mr. Trump, not at Mr. Sanders.The new Journal/NBC News/Marist poll found Mr. Sanders building big margins among younger voters, as he has in other states. Among Democratic primary voters age 18 to 29, the poll found, 80% favor Mr. Sanders, while Mrs. Clinton garners almost twice his support among primary voters age 45 and older.Mr. Sanders also outpaces the Democratic front-runner by a wide margin, 72% to 28%, among those voters who would be participating for the first time.""We are seeing a familiar pattern in what is the last major pre-convention collision between Clinton and Sanders,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ""Age is the story in this California toss-up. Sanders inspires younger or first-time voters, and Clinton relies upon those who are older or have participated in the last.""The good news for Mrs. Clinton is that it looks like she has already banked a larger share of the early vote. She leads among those Californians who have already cast ballots, 58% to 41%. She also beats Mr. Sanders in the state's two biggest urban centers, the Bay Area and Los Angeles County.Mr. Sanders holds a slight lead, 49% to 46%, among Latino voters, who account for more than a quarter of likely Democratic primary voters. Some of these interviews were conducted in Spanish.The Clintons are well-known figures in California, with broad support in the entertainment and high-technology worlds. But Mr. Sanders has gained traction in the state as voters have gotten to know the self-described democratic socialist.""The Democratic Party in California is probably the most liberal Democratic Party in the country,"" said John Burton, chairman of California's party.Mr. Sanders has gone all-in, packing his schedule with appearances up and down the state in the run-up to the primary. On Wednesday, at a news conference in Spreckles, Calif., Mr. Sanders criticized his rival for not supporting a nationwide ban on ""fracking.""Mrs. Clinton has taken the position that she would support ""fracking"" under limited circumstances, and that, at present, the practice is not ""sufficiently regulated"" in certain locations.The poll casts doubt on Mr. Trump's recent claim that he will make California competitive in the fall. Mrs. Clinton leads him by 24 percentage points, 55% to 31%, with 6% undecided and 8% saying they would not vote for either. Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump by an even wider margin, 62% to 28%, with 10% saying they were either undecided or not supportive of either.In the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, Democrat Kamala Harris, the state's attorney general, leads the field as the preferred pick of 37% of primary voters. U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a fellow Democrat, is in a solid second place, with 19%.California's open primary system allows the top two finishers in next week's Senate primary to advance to the general election.California is one of six states to hold Democratic nominating contests on June 7, along with Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. The District of Columbia will officially close out the primary season the following week when it holds its contest on June 14.The poll of 557 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted May 29-31 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.Political analysts have documented a surge in Democratic voter registration this year, a development that could prove helpful to Mr. Sanders.Democratic voter registration in California more than tripled between Jan. 1 and the registration deadline on May 23, compared to a comparable period in the 2012 presidential race, according to Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data Inc., a bipartisan voter data company in California.Overall, more than 950,000 Democratic voters registered during this period, he said.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor and Peter Nicholas",6/3/16
Clinton Might Not Be the Nominee; A Sanders win in California would turbocharge the mounting Democratic unease about her viability.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792639913?accountid=12768,"There is now more than a theoretical chance that Hillary Clinton may not be the Democratic nominee for president.How could that happen, given that her nomination has been considered a sure thing by virtually everyone in the media and in the party itself? Consider the possibilities.The inevitability behind Mrs. Clinton's nomination will be in large measure eviscerated if she loses the June 7 California primary to Bernie Sanders. That could well happen.A recent PPIC poll shows Mrs. Clinton with a 2% lead over Mr. Sanders, and a Fox News survey found the same result. Even a narrow win would give him 250 pledged delegates or more--a significant boost. California is clearly trending to Mr. Sanders, and the experience in recent open primaries has been that the Vermont senator tends to underperform in pre-election surveys and over-perform on primary and caucus days, thanks to the participation of new registrants and young voters.To this end, data from mid-May show that there were nearly 1.5 million newly registered voters in California since Jan. 1. That includes a 218% increase in Democratic voter registrations compared with the same period in 2012, a strongly encouraging sign for Mr. Sanders.A Sanders win in California would powerfully underscore Mrs. Clinton's weakness as a candidate in the general election. Democratic superdelegates--chosen by the party establishment and overwhelmingly backing Mrs. Clinton, 543-44--would seriously question whether they should continue to stand behind her candidacy.There is every reason to believe that at the convention Mr. Sanders will offer a rules change requiring superdelegates to vote for the candidate who won their state's primary or caucus. A vote on that proposed change would almost certainly occur--and it would function as a referendum on the Clinton candidacy. If Mr. Sanders wins California, Montana and North Dakota on Tuesday and stays competitive in New Jersey, he could well be within 200 pledged delegates of Mrs. Clinton, making a vote in favor of the rules change on superdelegates more likely.Another problem: In recent weeks the perception that Mrs. Clinton would be the strongest candidate against Donald Trump has evaporated. The Real Clear Politics polling average has Mrs. Clinton in a statistical tie with Mr. Trump, and recent surveys from ABC News/Washington Post and Fox News show her two and three points behind him, respectively.Then there is that other crack in the argument for Mrs. Clinton's inevitability: Bernie Sanders consistently runs stronger than she does against Mr. Trump nationally, beating him by about 10 points in a number of recent surveys.The worries about Mr. Sanders's strength have stirred the beginnings of a capitulation to him--by the Clinton camp, in league with the Democratic National Committee--at the convention. To placate him, they have already granted Mr. Sanders greater influence over the party platform. Two divisive figures, Cornel West and Rep. Keith Ellison, have been added to the platform committee, ensuring that the party will be pulled further left. In addition to putting Mr. Sanders's socialist nostrums on display, the platform negotiations are likely to spur an ugly fight over the U.S. relationship with Israel.Mrs. Clinton also faces growing legal problems. The State Department inspector general's recent report on Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state made it abundantly clear that she broke rules and has been far from forthright in her public statements. The damning findings buttressed concerns within the party that Mrs. Clinton and her aides may not get through the government's investigation without a finding of culpability somewhere.With Mrs. Clinton reportedly soon to be interviewed by the FBI, suggesting that the investigation is winding up, a definitive ruling by the attorney general could be issued before the July 25 Democratic convention in Philadelphia. Given the inspector general's report, a clean bill of health from the Justice Department is unlikely.Finally, with Mrs. Clinton's negative rating nearly as high as Donald Trump's, and with voters not trusting her by a ratio of 4 to 1, Democrats face an unnerving possibility. Only a month or two ago, they were relishing the prospect of a chaotic Republican convention, with a floor fight and antiestablishment rebellion in the air. Now the messy, disastrous convention could be their own.There are increasing rumblings within the party about how a new candidate could emerge at the convention. John Kerry, the 2004 nominee, is one possibility. But the most likely scenario is that Vice President Joe Biden--who has said that he regrets ""every day"" his decision not to run--enters the race.Mr. Biden would be cast as the white knight rescuing the party, and the nation, from a possible Trump presidency. To win over Sanders supporters, he would likely choose as his running mate someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren who is respected by the party's left wing.Where is President Obama in all this? So far he has largely stayed out of the campaign, other than to say that he doesn't believe Mrs. Clinton compromised national security with her home-brew email server. But with her poll numbers dropping, her legal headaches increasing, the Sanders candidacy showing renewed vigor, and Donald Trump looming as a wrecking ball for the president's legacy, Mr. Obama and adviser Valerie Jarrett might begin sending signals to the Democratic National Committee and to the vice president that a Biden rescue operation wouldn't displease the White House.All of these remain merely possibilities. But it is easier now than ever to imagine a scenario in which Hillary Clinton--whether by dint of legal or political circumstances--is not the Democratic presidential nominee.Mr. Schoen served as a political adviser and pollster for President Bill Clinton, 1994-2000.Corrections & AmplificationsAn earlier version mischaracterized the party affiliation of the 1.5 million newly registered voters in California since Jan. 1.Credit: By Douglas E.

"Hillary Clinton Seeks to Close Out Democratic Primary Race; Rival Bernie Sanders fights on as California, five other states hold contests",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794023329?accountid=12768,"COMPTON, Calif.--Standing on the precipice of clinching the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton made a final appeal to California voters Monday as she pushed to end a long presidential primary campaign on a high note.Five other states will also hold contests on Tuesday, and Mrs. Clinton is expected to secure the delegates needed to secure the nomination when New Jersey reports its results--likely before the polls even close in California. But she sees a win in California, the most populous state, as her chance to at last undercut rival Bernie Sanders's argument that he would be a more formidable Democratic candidate in a general-election match-up with Donald Trump.""It's not over 'til it's over,"" Mrs. Clinton told reporters. ""And tomorrow is a really important day, particularly here in California.""Mr. Sanders spent Monday in the San Francisco Bay Area. While he said he would do ""everything I can"" to win the 475 pledged delegates up for grabs in California, he toned down his rhetoric on continuing his campaign , sounding less determined to fight through the Democratic National Convention in July.The last big primary day on the calendar comes as President Barack Obama is poised to enter the fray and endorse the party's presumed nominee once the winner becomes clear. The president spoke over the weekend with Mr. Sanders, according to a person with knowledge of the phone call, but it isn't known what the men discussed.Mrs. Clinton needs just 23 delegates to assure victory. The six states on Tuesday--New Mexico, Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota are the others--will award a combined total of nearly 700 delegates. Mrs. Clinton holds a substantial lead over Mr. Sanders both in pledged delegates and superdelegates, party leaders or elected officials who are free to support either candidate.Polls show a race that is too close to call in California, and both Democrats have been barnstorming the state, campaigning from early morning until late in the evening.Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have campaigned separately across the state, holding a couple dozen events between the two of them in the past several days. The former senator and secretary of state on Monday was in the Los Angeles area, where she held rallies and planned to host a star-studded evening concert.Mr. Sanders has planted a flag in California, focusing all of his attention and resources on the state during the past couple of weeks.In a news conference Monday in Emeryville, Mr. Sanders declined to say whether he would consider endorsing Mrs. Clinton before the convention if he doesn't win Tuesday's contest.""You're asking me to speculate,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Let me talk to you after the primary in California. Let's assess where we are after tomorrow before we make statements based on speculation.""The Vermont senator had said in recent days that he would reject any assertion that Mrs. Clinton has essentially won the nomination because her delegate total includes the party superdelegates, who technically could change their minds and don't vote until the convention.On Monday, the senator said he would continue to make his case to superdelegates, urging them to switch their allegiance to his campaign. But his remarks were devoid of declarations he had made previously that he would continue his campaign through the convention. During the weekend, he predicted the July convention would be a contested one and vowed to keep fighting after Tuesday's primaries.Mrs. Clinton, for her part, said it was important for Democrats to unite during the coming weeks.""I'm going to do everything I can to unify the Democratic Party, and I certainly am going to be reaching out to Sen. Sanders and hope he will join me in that,"" she said. ""We've got to be unified going into the convention and coming out of the convention to take on Donald Trump and to repudiate that kind of campaign he is running and to make it clear that's not the kind of president or commander in chief we want.""Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist who supports Mrs. Clinton, said Tuesday's results ultimately won't change the outcome of the primary campaign or have a significant impact on Mrs. Clinton's prospects in the general election.""She is going to be the Democratic nominee for president whether she wins California or not,"" he said. ""It's always better to win than to lose, but at the end of the day, the process will be over.""Rebecca Ballhaus and Carol E.

But the debate within the campaign indicates that Mr. Sanders's next move isn't settled.For now, Democratic officials, fund-raisers and operatives are getting impatient, calling on Mr. Sanders to quit the race and begin the work of unifying the party for the showdown with the Republican presumptive nominee.Orin Kramer, a New York hedge-fund manager who has raised campaign funds for both President Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton, said with respect to Mr. Sanders's future plans: ""I would hope people would understand what a Trump presidency would mean and act accordingly--and 'accordingly' means quickly.""A strong showing in New Jersey on Tuesday, before California results even come in, could help Mrs. Clinton reach the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Her total includes hundreds of superdelegates--party leaders and elected officials who can back either candidate. Mr. Sanders is hoping that defeating Mrs. Clinton in the most populous state later Tuesday might give superdelegates reason to drop her and get behind his candidacy. Those superdelegates have given no indication they will shift allegiances.Even so, Mr. Sanders isn't backing off. In an interview that aired Sunday on CNN, he stepped up an attack on Mrs. Clinton involving the Clinton Foundation. Echoing a critique made by Republicans, Mr. Sanders said he has ""a problem"" with the foundation accepting money from foreign sources during her service as secretary of state.In a news conference Saturday in California, Mr. Sanders indicated he would battle for superdelegates all the way to the convention.""The Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton, who won Puerto Rico's Democratic primary on Sunday, seems to be running out of patience with Mr. Sanders. Having shifted her focus to Mr. Trump, she told CNN that after Tuesday, ""I'm going to do everything I can to reach out to try to unify the Democratic Party, and I expect Sen. Sanders to do the same.""When she ran against Mr. Obama in 2008, Mrs. Clinton stayed in the race until the end. As late as the final week of voting, she was talking hopefully of wooing super-delegates and capturing the nomination. But on June 7 of that year--four days after the primary season ended--she gave a speech bowing out and immediately threw her support to Mr. Obama.Later that month, the two chose the town of Unity, N.H., to make a high-profile joint appearance aimed at persuading Clinton voters to get behind Mr. Obama.Mr. Sanders is at a similar crossroads. The final contest of the primary season is June 14, when Washington D.C. votes.Tad Devine, a senior Sanders strategist who advised Democratic nominees Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, among others, suggested the ""path forward"" is uncertain, hinging on the outcome in California and other states that have yet to vote. He voiced a conciliatory note, describing how the two campaigns might set aside differences that have grown more pronounced in the heat of the year-long campaign.""What will happen hopefully when the voting is done, our two campaigns will begin to talk once more to one another and figure out where the common ground is,"" he said.Campaign manager Jeff Weaver, who has worked in Mr. Sanders's congressional offices and Vermont-based campaigns dating to the mid-1980s, takes a more aggressive approach.Mr. Weaver has long been one of the more tenacious loyalists on Team Sanders, having sparred repeatedly with Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz over the party's treatment of the Sanders campaign.A victory in California and elsewhere on Tuesday would ""strengthen"" the argument for the nomination, Mr. Weaver said, but it isn't necessary to keep the candidacy alive through the convention.""The plan is as the senator has described it: to go forward after Tuesday and keep the campaign going to the convention and make the case to superdelegates that Sen. Sanders is the best chance that Democrats have to beat Trump,"" Mr. Weaver said. ""The trajectory is the same regardless of the outcome in California.""That is what worries Democratic leaders. Pointing to polls indicating a tightening race in November, they say Mr. Sanders, if he is sincere about beating back Mr. Trump, must quickly join forces with the party front-runner.""Democrats will need as much unity as early as we can get it as possible,"" said Tom Daschle, a former senate Democratic leader. ""It would be a huge mistake to underestimate [Mr. Trump]. We've done that the entire election season.""Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid has concluded Mr. Sanders has no path to the nomination, an aide said, and that he should shift focus to helping Democrats pick up Senate seats. Doing so would help Mr. Sanders return to the chamber with more power than he wielded before the presidential race began a year ago, the aide said.William Daley, who chaired Mr. Gore's presidential campaign and served as a White House chief of staff for Mr. Obama, said in an interview the ""damage"" Mr. Sanders could do is ""overwhelming if he doesn't give [Mrs. Clinton] the breather she needs in the run-up to the convention to take on Trump.""At a minimum, some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters would like to see Mr. Sanders lay off the attacks. Alan Kessler, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, said Mr. Sanders's tone is ""a little disappointing.""""There's no reason why he shouldn't fight for the things that he's talking about, but there's no need to continually make it personal,"" he added.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",6/6/16
"Election 2016: Sanders Makes Bold -- and Risky -- Moves --- Trip to Vatican, harsh attacks on Clinton and her husband precede a crucial April 19 vote",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780733058?accountid=12768,"ALBANY, N.Y. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders is taking some of the boldest and potentially riskiest steps of his campaign ahead of the crucial New York primary, hoping to raise his profile and undercut Hillary Clinton's support among a key part of the Democratic electorate.After his debate with the Democratic presidential front-runner on Thursday, Mr. Sanders will leave the U.S. to appear at an academic conference at the Vatican devoted to themes of economic and social justice. Both issues are at the core of Mr. Sanders's message. But some Democrats are baffled as to why he would drop off the campaign trail for two days before the April 19 primary, where more delegates are at stake than in any other state save California.""My advice to Bernie would be: 'Don't go to the other side of the Hudson River. Stay here where you belong,' ""said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based Democratic strategist not aligned with either candidate.Leading up to the primary, Mr. Sanders has also escalated criticism of both Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who remains a popular figure in the party. Only 9% of Democrats said they viewed Mr. Clinton negatively in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in February.Appearing in New York's Harlem neighborhood last week, Mr. Sanders said at a forum devoted to race relations that the welfare overhaul signed by Mr. Clinton in 1996 was a campaign ploy to win voters at the expense of the poorest Americans.""Bernie is a fighter, and he understands clearly what he needs to do to move forward,"" said Gary De Carolis, an ally when Mr. Sanders was mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s. ""He will be tougher and tougher on the issues that he thinks [Mrs. Clinton] is vulnerable on.""In campaign stops in New York, Mr. Sanders has grown more caustic about the six-figure fees Mrs. Clinton earned in speeches to New York financial firms. ""Not bad for a day's work,"" he said at a recent rally in Albany. He is taking aim at what polls show is one of Mrs. Clinton's biggest points of vulnerability: perceptions that she is too close to Wall Street.At a recent speech in Rochester, he faulted her for benefiting from super PACs that take money from financial interests. Wall Street has given more than $17 million to outside groups backing her, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said Mr. Sanders's latest tactics undercut his vow to focus his campaign on issues. ""In the last week, Sen. Sanders has questioned Hillary Clinton's qualifications, her judgment and most recently her credibility,"" he said. ""If that doesn't amount to a personal attack, I don't know what does.""The moves by Mr. Sanders could test Democratic unity. Should she win the nomination, Mrs. Clinton will need to rally Sanders supporters and create a united front against Republicans in the general election. But Mr. Sanders's attacks are resonating with his voters. At rallies, he typically doesn't try to silence the crowd when they start to boo at the mention of her name.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll this month showed that 30% of Sanders supporters in New York said they wouldn't back Mrs. Clinton in the general election.Mr. Sanders's moves come at a make-or-break point in his candidacy. He continues to draw boisterous crowds of young supporters. On Wednesday, he picked up endorsements from New York City's transit union and also Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon. Mr. Merkley becomes the first of Mr. Sanders's Senate colleagues to endorse him.Despite winning eight of the last nine contests, Mr. Sanders hasn't put Mrs. Clinton's lead in jeopardy. A preliminary Associated Press tally shows that in what has been his most successful stretch, the last nine contests have only cut into her lead by 71 pledged delegates. Mrs. Clinton currently enjoys a lead of 251 pledged delegates.That makes the New York primary close to a must-win proposition for Mr. Sanders, some Democrats say.Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist who isn't aligned with either candidate, said: ""For Bernie to have any hope of ultimately prevailing, he's got to start winning every big state by big margins. If he doesn't win New York, he's going to soon look like a spoiler and not an insurgent.""People close to Mr. Sanders say he has no interest in playing that role -- weakening Mrs. Clinton to the point that she might lose in November.John Franco, a longtime friend of Mr. Sanders, said in an interview he recalled an early discussion in which Mr. Sanders made clear he didn't want to be a ""spoiler."" ""That conversation was settled in five minutes,"" Mr. Franco said.---Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",6/6/16

"Bernie Sanders Campaign Is Split Over Whether to Fight on Past Tuesday; The senator has vowed to press his case, but some urge him to unite behind Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794038738?accountid=12768,"A split is emerging inside the Bernie Sanders campaign over whether the senator should stand down after Tuesday's election contests and unite behind Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, or take the fight all the way to the July party convention and try to pry the nomination from her.One camp might be dubbed the Sandersistas, the loyalists who helped guide Mr. Sanders's political ascent in Vermont and the U.S. Congress and are loath to give up a fight that has far surpassed expectations. Another has ties not only to Mr. Sanders but to the broader interests of a Democratic Party pining to beat back the challenge from Republican Donald Trump and make gains in congressional elections.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Sanders Eases His Tone on His Plans After Tuesday's Primaries* Is Tuesday Bernie Sanders's Last Stand?* Party Elders Knock Trump Over Comments on Judge* Trump: Anti-Trump Protesters Were 'Paid Agitators' Sent by Democrats* Trump Wins Support From Victims' Families in Immigration Debate* Group to Spend $16 Million to Keep Senate in GOP HandsMr. Sanders in recent weeks has made clear he aims to take his candidacy past the elections on Tuesday, when California, New Jersey and four other states vote. But the debate within the campaign indicates that Mr. Sanders's next move isn't settled.For now, Democratic officials, fund-raisers and operatives are getting impatient, calling on Mr. Sanders to quit the race and begin the work of unifying the party for the showdown with the Republican presumptive nominee.Orin Kramer, a New York hedge-fund manager who has raised campaign funds for both President Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton, said with respect to Mr. Sanders's future plans: ""I would hope people would understand what a Trump presidency would mean and act accordingly--and 'accordingly' means quickly.""A strong showing in New Jersey on Tuesday, before California results even come in, could help Mrs. Clinton reach the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Her total includes hundreds of superdelegates--party leaders and elected officials who can back either candidate. Mr. Sanders is hoping that defeating Mrs. Clinton in the most populous state later Tuesday might give superdelegates reason to drop her and get behind his candidacy. Those superdelegates have given no indication they will shift allegiances.Even so, Mr. Sanders isn't backing off. In an interview that aired Sunday on CNN, he stepped up an attack on Mrs. Clinton involving the Clinton Foundation. Echoing a critique made by Republicans, Mr. Sanders said he has ""a problem"" with the foundation accepting money from foreign sources during her service as secretary of state.In a news conference Saturday in California, Mr. Sanders indicated he would battle for superdelegates all the way to the convention.""The Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton, who won Puerto Rico's Democratic primary on Sunday, seems to be running out of patience with Mr. Sanders. Having shifted her focus to Mr. Trump, she told CNN that after Tuesday, ""I'm going to do everything I can to reach out to try to unify the Democratic Party, and I expect Sen. Sanders to do the same.""When she ran against Mr. Obama in 2008, Mrs. Clinton stayed in the race until the end. As late as the final week of voting, she was talking hopefully of wooing super-delegates and capturing the nomination. But on June 7 of that year--four days after the primary season ended--she gave a speech bowing out and immediately threw her support to Mr. Obama.Later that month, the two chose the town of Unity, N.H., to make a high-profile joint appearance aimed at persuading Clinton voters to get behind Mr. Obama.Mr. Sanders is at a similar crossroads. The final contest of the primary season is June 14, when Washington D.C. votes.Tad Devine, a senior Sanders strategist who advised Democratic nominees Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, among others, suggested the ""path forward"" is uncertain, hinging on the outcome in California and other states that have yet to vote. He voiced a conciliatory note, describing how the two campaigns might set aside differences that have grown more pronounced in the heat of the year-long campaign.""What will happen hopefully when the voting is done, our two campaigns will begin to talk once more to one another and figure out where the common ground is,"" he said.Campaign manager Jeff Weaver, who has worked in Mr. Sanders's congressional offices and Vermont-based campaigns dating to the mid-1980s, takes a more aggressive approach.Mr. Weaver has long been one of the more tenacious loyalists on Team Sanders, having sparred repeatedly with Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz over the party's treatment of the Sanders campaign.A victory in California and elsewhere on Tuesday would ""strengthen"" the argument for the nomination, Mr. Weaver said, but it isn't necessary to keep the candidacy alive through the convention.""The plan is as the senator has described it: to go forward after Tuesday and keep the campaign going to the convention and make the case to superdelegates that Sen. Sanders is the best chance that Democrats have to beat Trump,"" Mr. Weaver said. ""The trajectory is the same regardless of the outcome in California.""That is what worries Democratic leaders. Pointing to polls indicating a tightening race in November, they say Mr. Sanders, if he is sincere about beating back Mr. Trump, must quickly join forces with the party front-runner.""Democrats will need as much unity as early as we can get it as possible,"" said Tom Daschle, a former senate Democratic leader. ""It would be a huge mistake to underestimate [Mr. Trump]. We've done that the entire election season.""Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid has concluded Mr. Sanders has no path to the nomination, an aide said, and that he should shift focus to helping Democrats pick up Senate seats. Doing so would help Mr. Sanders return to the chamber with more power than he wielded before the presidential race began a year ago, the aide said.William Daley, who chaired Mr. Gore's presidential campaign and served as a White House chief of staff for Mr. Obama, said in an interview the ""damage"" Mr. Sanders could do is ""overwhelming if he doesn't give [Mrs. Clinton] the breather she needs in the run-up to the convention to take on Trump.""At a minimum, some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters would like to see Mr. Sanders lay off the attacks. Alan Kessler, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, said Mr. Sanders's tone is ""a little disappointing.""""There's no reason why he shouldn't fight for the things that he's talking about, but there's no need to continually make it personal,"" he added.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",6/7/16
"Bernie 'Wins' California; In the Golden State, the Sanders approach favors the haves.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794023337?accountid=12768,"Could Bernie Sanders really defeat Hillary Clinton in California?The question has been dominating the news coverage, because the socialist senator from Vermont is now locked in a statistical dead heat with the former secretary of state as Californians get ready to make their pick in Tuesday's Democratic primary. Though a Sanders upset in California would not likely deprive Mrs. Clinton of the nomination, it would leave her limping into what her rival insists will be a contested convention.For the American people, the more salient point is this: When it comes to economics, Bernie Sanders won California a long time ago. The senator's progressive pieties and obsessions are more or less California's pieties and obsessions. And there's the rub, because the great cautionary tale of progressivism is that you have to be fairly rich to enjoy the benefits.Joel Kotkin, a presidential fellow at Chapman University and the executive director of the Center for Opportunity Urbanism, calls California's progressive economy the ""new feudalism.""""In practice,"" Mr. Kotkin says, ""it makes upward mobility very difficult and hurts the very people it claims to help.""If a May 25 Field Poll is to be believed, Bernie's popularity with California Democrats shouldn't be any surprise. Though both Democrats and Republicans rank jobs and the economy as their top concern, from there they go in much different directions. Indeed, likely Democratic voters list among their top 10 priorities ""climate change, income inequality, college affordability, equal pay for women, ensuring clean air/water, and keeping the U.S. out of war.""Sure sounds like Bernie. Here it's not just talk, either. From the new $15-an-hour state minimum wage to the war on greenhouse gases to the imposition of the nation's highest top marginal income-tax rate, the Bernie agenda has blossomed in California.Gov. Jerry Brown admitted as much last week. At the same time he endorsed Mrs. Clinton, he spoke warmly of Bernie's war on ""the one percent,"" saying it reminded him of his own campaign for president back in 1992.Though he failed at the national level, in California Mr. Brown today presides over a tax code right out of a Bernie Sanders dream. The governor took one of America's most progressive tax codes and made it even more top-heavy--with a ""temporary"" (we'll see about that) tax hike that jacked the state's top marginal tax rate to 13.3%.As a result, the wealthiest 1% of Californians today pay half the state's income taxes despite accounting for only about a quarter of its income. State tax revenues are up, state unemployment is down and jobs now exceed prerecession levels.In the process Mr. Brown has been transformed from Governor Moonbeam to the Practical Progressive. The accolades have been quick in coming: Rolling Stone (""Jerry Brown's Tough-Love California Miracle""); Newsweek (""How Jerry Brown Quietly Saved California""); the Nation (""How Jerry Brown Got Californians to Raise Their Taxes and Save Their State""); well, you get the picture.So what's not to like?Answer: a downturn.For notwithstanding the headlines about how today's California refutes Republican scaremongering on taxes and regulation, California's state funding structure remains as precarious as ever. Because California is so dependent on individuals and capital gains, the moment there's a downturn in the stock market, all the old problems will come roaring back.Even now California's economic boom is masking some hard realities, especially for those on the lower rungs of society whose cause Mr. Sanders professes to champion.Most glaring of all is housing. In California, only the very wealthy can afford what was once deemed the essence of the American dream: a home of your own. When the cost of housing is factored in, moreover, it turns out California has the highest poverty rate in the nation.Today progressives crow that there's no evidence the rich are fleeing California's high marginal tax rates. But is it a progressive achievement that people of more modest means are being driven out of the state by housing prices that are themselves being driven up by California's no-build mentality? Is it a victory for the little guy that, for those without a bachelor's degree or an annual income of at least $50,000, California now has more people moving out than moving in?It's partly for these reasons the Hoover Institution's Carson Bruno says that the so-called California comeback should really be called ""Silicon Valley holding up the rest of the state."" Meaning that if you confine your gaze to this high-tech oasis of wealth, weather and well-being, it's easy to feel the Bern.Point is, whoever emerges at the top of California's Democratic primary, Mr. Sanders has already won the argument. And the folks paying the highest price for this progressive victory are those who can't afford a Volvo to put their Bernie stickers on.Write to McGurn@wsj.com.Credit: By William McGurn",6/7/16
"Bernie's Program Sells, but Consider the Cost; As wonderful as Bernie's campaign promises sound, I wish his young supporters would ask a few critical questions.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793982281?accountid=12768,"I have watched with despair as the Bernie Sanders campaign has gained momentum over the past months; however, unlike his Senate colleagues, I am not surprised at his success on the campaign trail because he has conducted a very intelligent campaign (""Sanders Advance Surprises Senate ,"" U.S. News, May 13). He entered the race wanting to foist his socialist ideologies on the electorate, and he knew better than to approach the older voters who were well aware of the failed socialist states of the past. He sought out our children on college campuses, where many of them were primed to hear his message. He addressed their immediate concerns about the burdens of college debt and the cost of medical insurance. Mr.Sanders convinced them that the burdens they were enduring had been imposed upon them by outside forces over which they had little control. To restore economic equality, it would take a revolution, music to a young person's ears.As wonderful as his campaign promises sound, I wish his young supporters would ask a few critical questions. Free college education provided by the state is appealing, but at some point the state is going to dictate which programs will be funded. The state will need scientists, mathematicians and engineers.

Bernie Sanders Prepares to Cut Staff as Last Push Falls Short; Aide says some staff would be transitioned into new roles as campaign moves into convention mode,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794278475?accountid=12768,"Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will soon make cuts to his staff, according to a campaign aide, after Hillary Clinton fended off his final charge and declared victory in the Democratic primary race .The campaign aide said the cuts were driven in part by the calendar. Now that the primary season is almost over--the District of Columbia votes next week--the campaign no longer has use for field directors in California and other states, the aide said.Another campaign aide said some aides would be transitioned into other roles as the primaries end and the campaign moves into convention mode.It wasn't clear how deep the cuts would be. The New York Times reported Tuesday that ""at least half"" of his staff would be laid off.Michael Briggs, Mr. Sanders's spokesman, declined to comment late Tuesday. Mr. Sanders was expected to speak later in the night.The Associated Press on Monday declared Mrs. Clinton the presumptive nominee after a survey of superdelegates put her over the 2,383 threshold to win the nomination, and pledged delegates won in Tuesday night's six contests further solidified her standing. Mr. Sanders has placed his remaining hopes on convincing superdelegates to shift their loyalties to him. So far, none has done so.Of the Tuesday races called so far, Mrs. Clinton won New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, while Mr. Sanders won North Dakota. Two other states--including California, which awards 475 pledged delegates--also voted Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton also asserted herself as the party's nominee in a speech Tuesday night, calling it a ""milestone"" that for ""the first time in our nation's history where a woman will be a major party's nominee.""Mr. Sanders, who broke fundraising records earlier this year, has struggled to raise enough money to match his spending pace in recent months. At the end of April, he had just $5.8 million in the bank, compared with Mrs. Clinton's $30 million. His fundraising fell that month to $26 million, $20 million less than the previous month. Since the end of April, he has spent at least $2 million on TV and radio ads in California, where he spent the last weeks campaigning. That race hasn't yet been called.While both candidates have raised similar amounts over the course of the cycle, Mrs. Clinton has been more frugal. Her campaign said last week that it had $42 million in the bank at the end of May, and she also has the backing of a super PAC that has raised more than $75 million.Mr. Sanders has so far suggested he plans to forge ahead after Tuesday's primaries. The Vermont senator plans to travel to his home state on Wednesday and then will campaign on Thursday in Washington, D.C., the final contest, where Mrs. Clinton is favored to win.In a speech last weekend, Mr. Sanders vowed to stay in the race through the convention and make the case to superdelegates that they should shift their support to his campaign. But in a news conference on Monday, Mr. Sanders took a cooler tone, saying he would ""assess"" the race after the California primary and making no mention of contesting the July convention.Mr. Sanders last made major staff cuts at the end of April , when he laid off hundreds of field staffers after a tough stretch in which he lost five of six nominating contests.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Rebecca Ballhaus and Peter Nicholas",6/8/16

Hillary Clinton Expected to Be First Woman to Win Major Party Nomination; Democratic front-runner expected to win in New Jersey primary; Bernie Sanders aims for California triumph,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794196450?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton was poised to declare victory Tuesday night in the Democratic presidential primary race, emerging from a bruising battle as a history-making candidate and the first woman within striking distance of occupying the Oval Office.Her rise comes exactly eight years after she ended her 2008 bid by declaring primary voters had helped her put 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling that had prevented women from winning the presidency since the nation's founding.""We're on our way to breaking the highest and hardest glass ceiling,"" she told supporters recently in California in a reference to the November general election, where she will square off with Republican presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.Read More on Capital Journal* Live Updates on Tuesday's Primaries* How Clinton Won* Call on Hillary Clinton Nomination Win Was a Surprise to Democratic Candidates* How California Voting Rules Complicate Bernie Sanders's Primary Challenge* California's Democratic Primary Map: Places to WatchVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders aimed to throw up one last roadblock by winning the California Democratic primary on Tuesday, when six states held contests. Mrs. Clinton's victory, however, was expected to be cemented with a win in New Jersey, hours before the polls closed in California.Ellen Dubois, a professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the unique road Mrs. Clinton walked underscored the transformation of women's roles. ""There's been a gradual movement of women into meaningful positions in political parties and elected offices,"" she said. ""Whatever happens in this election, it will not completely clear the path, but it does open the path.""Women helped propel Mrs. Clinton to victory in the Democratic primary, exit polls taken this primary season in 27 states showed. While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders split men's votes nearly evenly, the polls found the former secretary of state won 61% of women, while the Vermont senator won just 37%.But Mrs. Clinton still has work to do to shore up potential advantages with women voters as she pivots to the general election. A May Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll found that she leads among women by 13 percentage points; among women with college educations she's ahead by 24 percentage points.But Mr. Trump leads among white women with less than a college education by 11 percentage points--more than his 9-point advantage among men.For his part, Mr. Trump appears determined to confront the gender issue head-on. ""I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry, and my relationship, I think, is going to end up being very good with women,"" Mr. Trump told Fox News.Although Mrs. Clinton was long viewed as the inevitable Democratic nominee, the road during this primary season was much rockier than anticipated, with Mr. Sanders posing an unexpectedly persistent and formidable threat.The self-described democratic socialist from Vermont won more than 20 contests along the way and--until this week--denied her the pledged delegates needed to become the party's standard-bearer.""I am going to be meeting with our supporters to figure out the best way forward--so that we have a government which represents all of us and not just the 1%,"" Mr. Sanders told NBC News on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator, maintained a lead among superdelegates, party leaders who can back whomever they want, and that gave her an advantage throughout the race. They put her over the 2,383 delegate threshold on Monday, prompting the Associated Press to declare her the presumptive nominee.Mr. Sanders has long objected to the influence of superdelegates , who will officially cast their votes at the July convention in Philadelphia, and he has vowed to try to take some from Mrs. Clinton. It is unclear now, though, whether he will continue to woo them, or even whether he will keep campaigning through the final primary in Washington, D.C., on June 14, where Mrs. Clinton is favored to win.From the start, Mrs. Clinton embraced the historic nature of her candidacy, a contrast to 2008, when advisers concluded her priority should be to project toughness and assure voters she was prepared to be commander in chief.With four years as secretary of state on her résumé, advisers saw her gender in this campaign as a selling point, both for older women who came of age at a time when women had fewer opportunities, and for parents, who wanted to show their daughters anything was possible.On the campaign trail, she has talked frequently about women and children's issues, including equal pay for women . She reminded voters she was a new grandmother. In the campaign's online store, T-shirts made to look like her signature pantsuits were for sale, along with a pillow with the words, ""A woman's place is in the White House.""Soon, the campaign's social media hashtag became #ImWithHer and her supporters would chant ""I believe that she can win.""When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused her of ""playing the gender card,"" the campaign decided to highlight his words. Mrs. Clinton would recount the charge at rallies, adding that if sticking up for women's right was playing the gender card, then ""deal me in!""Later, when Mr. Trump made a similar charge--this time accusing her of playing the ""woman's card""--Mrs. Clinton revived the slogan, and her campaign began selling ""woman's cards"" to supporters.On Tuesday, the Clinton campaign celebrated the moment with a video featuring words and images of American women who have made history, including feminist Gloria Steinem and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. ""Think of the suffragettes who gathered at Seneca Falls in 1848,"" Mrs. Clinton says, ""and those who kept fighting until women could cast their vote,"" starting in 1920.Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said Mrs. Clinton's nomination--and Mr. Trump's focus on her gender--would spark an important discussion about the obstacles women still face. ""There are still some progressives who, bless their hearts, are not on board with a woman becoming leader of the free world,"" she said. ""I think it does need to be part of the national conversation.""At the polls Tuesday, some voters said they were motivated by the chance to cast a historic vote--and they weren't all women. Andrew Rind, a 56-year-old Montclair, N.J., resident, said he voted for Mrs. Clinton based on her experience and because Mr. Sanders seems ""a little too extreme."" Electing a woman president ""is long overdue,"" Mr. Rind said. ""I'm kind of tired of the prototype of the privileged, white male president.""Kate King and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Laura Meckler",6/8/16
"Democrats Gird for Battle Over Platform; Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders supporters grapple over direction of party's policy agenda",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794196398?accountid=12768,"The prolonged Democratic presidential fight now shifts to a different arena, as Sen. Bernie Sanders and his supporters grapple with presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton over their imprint on a platform that will lay out the party's vision and policy goals.A party's platform is often a forgettable offshoot of the presidential nomination process. Once in office, presidents tend to follow their own judgment and don't typically pull out the party platform for guidance.But the Sanders-Clinton battle for the nomination was filled with policy disagreements that carry the potential to leave the party divided. Mrs. Clinton is in a stronger position to shape the platform, but the Sanders forces are hoping to produce a document that reflects some portion of his liberal agenda. Should Mr. Sanders and his supporters come away dissatisfied, it could complicate the Democrats' task of unifying the party following a bitter nomination contest.Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, voiced optimism that the two sides would bridge their differences. ""Let's all remember, there is far more that unites us than divides us,"" he said.Indeed, issues of crime, punishment and race might be areas of agreement. Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have denounced police tactics that critics say target African-Americans.A Sanders campaign representative, Jonathan Tasini, said that coming to consensus wouldn't be easy. ""It's a mistake to think there will be a 'Kumbaya' moment,"" he said. ""We're not going to be standing there on the floor swaying with arms locked. There are fundamental differences about the future of the country and the party.""Work begins this week in Washington, D.C., as the party's 15-member platform drafting committee holds two days of hearings devoted to the economy, education, foreign policy and other issues. The panel's task is to help produce a platform that delegates will approve in July at the nominating convention in Philadelphia.Tensions are evident. Mr. Sanders tried to appoint to the drafting committee RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of a national nurses union and a strong advocate for a single-payer, government-run health-care system that Mrs. Clinton insists cannot pass.Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz turned down the request. A convention official gave as the reason for excluding Ms. DeMoro a need for diverse membership of convention committees, which means not stacking them with labor leaders.The Sanders campaign has also filed a formal protest asking the DNC to remove Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy from his post as co-chairman of the full platform committee. A DNC panel last month rejected the request, but the Sanders campaign has said it would persist in trying to disqualify Mr. Malloy, describing him as a biased, Clinton partisan. A Malloy representative didn't respond to a request for comment.Another flashpoint is foreign policy. The drafting panel includes six people named by Mrs. Clinton, five by Mr. Sanders and four by Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Two of the Sanders appointees are Cornel West and James Zogby, both of whom have been critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.The Democrats' 2012 platform places heavy emphasis on Israel's security. Sanders allies may be looking for a chance to tip the language so that it is more sensitive to Palestinian interests.In an interview, Mr. Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, spoke of ""an emerging new consensus in the Democratic Party"" that ""Israeli needs and Palestinian needs both have to be understood.""""We'll see how willing people are to find language that reflects that,"" he said.During the campaign, Mrs. Clinton supported a Middle East peace deal that would give Palestinians their own state. Still, there's no certainty Mrs. Clinton would go along with platform language that opponents might portray as elevating the Palestinian cause at the expense of an important U.S. ally, Israel.Other policy differences abound. Mr. Sanders wants a national minimum wage of $15; Mrs. Clinton supports a $12 minimum wage, though she has said she would back a $15 wage in some locations. Mr. Sanders opposes free-trade agreements; Mrs. Clinton has taken more of a case-by-case approach.""If we don't get a very firm position against free trade, that will be a problem for me and a lot of other people,"" Mr. Tasini said.Warren Gunnels, a Sanders aide who is a nonvoting member of the platform drafting committee, said, ""We're cautiously optimistic we can come together and have a platform that really addresses the needs of the middle class and working Americans.""Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",6/8/16

Just a day before Tuesday's contests in California and five other states, Mrs. Clinton emerged as her party's presumptive nominee and the first woman to lead the ticket for a major U.S. political party.The former secretary of state had been expected to win the delegates needed to secure victory inTuesday's primaries , but a last-minute show of support from a number of superdelegates pushed her across the finish line a day earlier.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* How Clinton Has Fended off Sanders* California's Democratic Primary Map: Places to Watch* Trump Seeks to Rally Support Over His Criticism of Judge* Polls Show Gary Johnson Is Unknown to Most Americans* Pro-Clinton Ad Revisits Donald Trump's Mocking of Disabled ReporterAfter a protracted and contentious primary season, the battle for the Democratic nomination ended with little fanfare. Mrs. Clinton and her advisers declined to take a victory lap, saying that they remained focused on notching wins in Tuesday's contests.Speaking in Long Beach, Calif., on Monday, Mrs. Clinton, said, ""According to the news, we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment, but we still have work to do, don't we?""Sen. Bernie Sanders spent Monday in the San Francisco Bay area. While he said he would do ""everything I can"" to win the 475 pledged delegates up for grabs in California, he toned down his rhetoric on continuing his campaign, sounding less determined to fight through the Democratic National Convention in July.Mr. Sanders's campaign rejected the assertion that Mrs. Clinton is now the presumptive nominee, noting that the delegate total includes superdelegates, who still could change their minds before the Democratic convention in July.""It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgment, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee's clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,"" said Michael Briggs, Mr. Sanders's spokesman.The last big primary day on the calendar comes as President Barack Obama is poised to enter the fray and endorse the party's presumed nominee. The president spoke over the weekend with Mr. Sanders, according to a person with knowledge of the phone call, but it isn't known what the men discussed.The six states on Tuesday--New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota are the others--will award a combined total of nearly 700 delegates. Mrs. Clinton holds a substantial lead over Mr. Sanders both in pledged delegates and superdelegates, party leaders or elected officials who are free to support either candidate.Polls show a race that is too close to call in California, and both Democrats have been barnstorming the state, campaigning from early morning until late in the evening.Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have campaigned separately across the state, holding a couple dozen events between the two of them in the past several days. The former senator and secretary of state on Monday was in the Los Angeles area, where she held rallies and planned to host a star-studded evening concert.Mr. Sanders has planted a flag in California, focusing all of his attention and resources on the state during the past couple of weeks.In a news conference Monday in Emeryville, Mr. Sanders declined to say whether he would consider endorsing Mrs. Clinton before the convention if he doesn't win Tuesday's contest.""You're asking me to speculate,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Let me talk to you after the primary in California. Let's assess where we are after tomorrow before we make statements based on speculation.""On Monday, the senator said he would continue to make his case to superdelegates, urging them to switch their allegiance to his campaign. But his remarks were devoid of declarations he had made previously that he would continue his campaign through the convention. During the weekend, he predicted the July convention would be a contested one and vowed to keep fighting after Tuesday's primaries.Mrs. Clinton, for her part, said it was important for Democrats to unite during the coming weeks.Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist who supports Mrs. Clinton, said Tuesday's results ultimately won't change the outcome of the primary campaign or have a significant impact on Mrs. Clinton's prospects in the general election.""She is going to be the Democratic nominee for president whether she wins California or not,"" he said. ""It's always better to win than to lose, but at the end of the day, the process will be over.""Rebecca Ballhaus and Carol E.

Democrats Strive for Party Unity; Pressure builds for Bernie Sanders to rally behind presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794677127?accountid=12768,"A Democratic Party that split over the fiercely contested presidential primary fight took its first steps toward uniting Wednesday, with prominent Bernie Sanders supporters conceding he had lost the race and saying they would rally behind the presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton.A day after Mrs. Clinton won California and three other states, Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who was the lone U.S. senator to endorse Mr. Sanders, said she has earned the party's nomination.""Once we have a candidate who has won the majority of the pledged delegates and the majority of the votes, we have a nominee,"" Mr. Merkley said. ""I had hoped the outcome would be that Bernie Sanders would win. In a democracy, one wins and others don't.""Aides to Mr. Sanders said he would stay in the race at least through June 14, when Washington, D.C., holds the final Democratic primary. Mr. Sanders was scheduled to hold a campaign event in Washington on Thursday and was also to meet privately with President Barack Obama.Before the voting on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders had said that he would carry the fight all the way to the convention next month in Philadelphia and would try to pry the nomination from Mrs. Clinton by urging her superdelegates to back his candidacy.A liberal group that had endorsed Mr. Sanders, Democracy for America, said Wednesday that if Mr. Sanders follows through on such plans, it wouldn't go along. With Mrs. Clinton leading by 376 pledged delegates--the kind elected by voters--it would be wrong for superdelegates to step in and effectively overturn the popular vote, the group said.""We believe [Mr. Sanders] has the right to do that, but we do not plan to help him do that,"" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the group, which recruits and promotes liberal candidates for elective office.Stepping off the sidelines, Mr. Obama is set to endorse Mrs. Clinton as early as Thursday. The pair will later make a joint campaign appearance in a battleground state targeting independent voters, people familiar with the matter said.Mr. Obama seems prepared to play peacemaker and ensure the party is unified in the general election showdown with Republican Donald Trump.In an interview Wednesday on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" Mr. Obama said: ""It was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary. I thought that Bernie Sanders brought enormous energy and new ideas."" He said his hope is ""that over the next couple of weeks we're able to pull things together.""The president has spoken to Mr. Sanders at least twice in recent weeks, hoping to gauge what Mr. Sanders might want from the party. The two are scheduled to meet Thursday, and the president is expected to say it is time for Democrats to set aside differences and embark on the larger project of defeating Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.Even some of Mr. Sanders's advisers aren't entirely sure what he'll do next. He left California and was scheduled to spend the night at his home in Burlington, Vt., on Wednesday.It was unclear whether Mr. Sanders intended to carry out his plan to peel away Mrs. Clinton's superdelegates, or if the four defeats he suffered had caused him to rethink his options.""What he said before June 7th may not be the case after June 7th,"" said Sanders pollster Ben Tulchin. ""The reality is he's going back to Vermont. And he has to absorb it and take it in. ... He's got to figure out how he can continue this progressive movement in the most effective and impactful way.""Behind the political drama is the disappointment surely felt by a candidate who was never expected to get this far. A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders wound up winning 22 states. Both the Clinton campaign and Mr. Sanders's allies have sought not to antagonize him by pressuring him to drop out.Mrs. Clinton knows firsthand how difficult it is to accept defeat. In her 2008 campaign against then-Sen. Obama, she stayed in the race until the final contests and then waited four days before giving a speech bowing out.""He has to process everything that he's accomplished over the last year,"" Mr. Tulchin said.Although the two have a strained relationship, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Sanders on Tuesday evening, part of a series of overtures the Clinton campaign has been making to Mr. Sanders as the race nears the end.In an interview, Mrs. Clinton said: ""I called him to really express my appreciation and congratulate him on running a hard-fought and very determined campaign that I thought added a lot to the Democratic Party and to our debate in the country. And I looked forward to having a chance to work with him on these issues.""Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Carol E.

Taking into account the six contests on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton has at least 2,755 delegates to 1,852 delegates for Mr. Sanders, according to an Associated Press count--enough to for her to declare victory near the end of the primary season. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Clinton Declares 'Milestone' Victory* Trump Calls Comments on Judge 'Misconstrued'* Judge Delays Sanctions Against Justice Department* Clinton's Time Arrives, but Are the Times Right for Her?* Trump Is Getting a Late Start on Fundraising* Clinton Hopes for Bounce After Winning Democratic RaceJust the District of Columbia has yet to vote, where only 20 delegates are at stake in the city's June 14 primary. Mr. Sanders has vowed to remain in the race until after the D.C. primary.Democrats divide up their delegates into pledged delegates, who are elected in caucuses and primaries, and unpledged ""superdelegates,"" or Democratic Party insiders who are free to cast a vote for any candidate at the party's July convention.The exact number of pledged delegates from Tuesday's contests won't be known until after vote counting is finished in California.Mrs. Clinton dominated Mr. Sanders by three of the metrics needed to win a primary campaign: beating Mr. Sanders handily in the popular vote, amassing nearly 400 more pledged delegate than the Vermont Senator and using her deep ties to the Democratic Party establishment to lock up many superdelegates early in the process.A vote tally compiled by Real Clear Politics gave her a lead of more than 3 million in the popular vote, though some caucuses don't give vote tallies.In pledged delegates, three networks projected she would receive an outright majority.She also dominated in the superdelegate battle, with nearly 600 publicly supporting her. Mr. Sanders has drawn only 48 superdelegates and has made no inroads in convincing her backers to switch sides.The former secretary of state became the presumptive Democratic nominee this week ahead of the six Tuesday primaries after the Associated Press declared she had garnered enough support from the unpledged superdelegates to secure the nomination. The states voting Tuesday night were California, New Jersey, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.The Sanders campaign said it would continue to try to sway superdelegates ahead of the Democratic convention.""Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates who don't vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then,"" Sanders campaign communications director Michael Briggs said.""Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump,"" he added.Mrs. Clinton has built a much more commanding lead over Mr. Sanders than in the last contested Democratic primary campaign in 2008, when President Barack Obama emerged as the winner.By the end of the final set of primaries in the 2008 race, Mr. Obama led Mrs. Clinton by about 125 pledged delegates. He had 389 superdelegates supporting him at the close of the primary season.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Byron Tau",6/9/16
"How Millennials Can Still Live Bernie's Dream; Check out this federal experiment in socialism. Free education, free single-payer health care. Forty days of paid leave. Sounds Nordic, but it's all-American!",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795516701?accountid=12768,"They backed him over Hillary Clinton in greater numbers than they backed Barack Obama over John McCain. But now, millions of millennials are left licking their wounds after the defeat of Bernie Sanders, the greatest progressive hero since the president he wanted to replace.Many of them recoil at the thought of supporting Mrs. Clinton, a liberal but one with insufficient anticapitalist bona fides. For now, the Bernie-backers' dream of grafting Scandinavian solutions onto American problems is dead.Or is it? Despite some recent budgetary setbacks, a long-running American experiment in socialism is still going strong, and yet somehow it remains one of the country's best-kept secrets.Related Articles* Bernie the Economic Warrior* The Young and the Economically Clueless* Bernie and the 'Lunatic of One Idea'The federal experiment involves 1.3 million Americans--less than 1% of the population, but 75% of the participants are themselves millennials, so Bernie's supporters should feel right at home. Unless they feel like they've arrived in socialist heaven. Consider:These lucky few, including their spouses and children, receive free single-payer health care. Pre-existing conditions? No problem. Prescriptions? Generally free.Bernie only proposed free college for all; that's already a reality for these young Americans. Local elementary schooling for their children is also tossed in at no cost. Vocational training? When do you want to start? And put your wallet away.What's more, the federal government provides these participants with generous living allowances. On top of their normal salaries, they collect a monthly allowance for rent or mortgage payments, an allowance for moving costs incurred when their job location changes, and an allowance for gas consumed when driving for work-related purposes. There's even a clothing allowance. Oh, none of these allowances is taxable. Did I mention that tax preparation services are also free?In case you thought it couldn't get any more Nordic for these chosen few, they get 30 days of paid vacation a year in addition to the usual 10 paid federal holidays. That's 40 days of paid leave every year--more than in the Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.These Americans are also eligible for a lifetime pension. If they enter the program after high school, they can start collecting their retirement--half the dollar amount of their final salary, every year for the rest of their life--at age 38! Not even Bernie thought of that. The amount they collect is calculated annually according to the Consumer Price Index and the effects of inflation, so the pension payments increase each year as the cost of living rises.Speaking of salaries: No gender pay gap here. A male who occupies the same position with the same experience cannot earn more than his female colleague. That's the rule, not subject to the whim of a paymaster.So come on over, disappointed young Bernie fans. Someone's already living your dream. There is one catch: Occasionally the program can get a bit dangerous, and you'll be beyond the reach of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Welcome to the U.S. Armed Forces, my fellow millennials.

Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat with a devoted following from the party's liberal wing, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president Thursday night.Ms. Warren had been one of the last high-profile Democratic leaders to choose between backing Mrs. Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as they slogged through the Democratic presidential primary contests. Coming at the end of the primary calendar, Ms. Warren's endorsement is expected to help the former Secretary of State win over Mr. Sanders's supporters.""I am ready to get in this fight and work my heart out for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States--and to make sure that Donald Trump never gets anyplace close to the White House,"" Ms. Warren said on the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC Thursday night . Earlier Thursday, President Barack Obama officially endorsed Mrs. Clinton .Although Ms. Warren's focus on curbing Wall Street and diminishing income inequality aligned most closely with Mr. Sanders's campaign, she hadn't endorsed him. Mrs. Clinton long held a commanding lead in delegates and clinched the necessary number to become the presumptive nominee this week.In recent weeks, Democrats worried that the long fight between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton would harm the party's ability to coalesce if Mr. Sanders's liberal supporters felt alienated by the process. Ms. Warren said Mr. Sanders played a constructive role by highlighting issues that energized new voters.""He ran a campaign from the heart, and he ran a campaign where he took these issues and he really thrust them into the spotlight,"" she said. ""He brought millions of people into the process.""Mr. Sanders on Thursday said he would compete in the final Democratic presidential primary in Washington, D.C., next week but also hinted he was ready to wind down his candidacy.Republicans said Ms. Warren's endorsement of Mrs. Clinton undermined her attacks on Wall Street and other liberal principles.""By endorsing Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren has shown herself to be a sellout,"" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. ""Hillary Clinton represents everything Elizabeth Warren supposedly stands against.""Ms. Warren is considered a possible vice presidential pick. If she did run with Mrs. Clinton and won, Ms. Warren's Senate seat would be filled by someone appointed by her state's Republican governor.The senator said she hadn't talked to Mrs. Clinton about being her running mate, but Ms. Warren said she believed she would be capable of serving in the role.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comCredit: By Kristina Peterson",6/10/16

Bernie Sanders on Thursday vowed to compete in the final Democratic presidential primary next week in Washington, D.C., but also hinted that he was ready to wind down his candidacy as party officials rallied behind Hillary Clinton.Mr. Sanders spent the day in Washington, meeting privately with President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Senate colleagues. Party leaders urged him to accept defeat and help unite Democrats for the general-election showdown with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama congratulated and complimented Mr. Sanders on his campaign. Mr. Earnest called it ""a friendly conversation that was focused on the future."" An hour after the Oval Office visit, Mr. Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton in a video released by her campaign.In another sign the party is coalescing around Mrs. Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a hero of the liberal Democratic wing, endorsed the former secretary of state Thursday evening in an interview on MSNBC. Ms. Warren's endorsement might prove particularly valuable to Mrs. Clinton, given her credibility with the young, liberal voters who gravitated toward Mr. Sanders.Ms. Warren said Democrats need to be tougher in their dealings with opponents and ""ought to be willing to throw a punch."" She added: ""There are a lot of things that people say about Hillary Clinton but nobody says that she doesn't know how to throw a punch.""Before California and five other states voted Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said he would carry his fight to the party's national convention next month in Philadelphia, trying to flip superdelegates loyal to Mrs. Clinton. That calculation may have changed. After losses in California, New Jersey and two other states that day, Mr. Sanders seems to be rethinking that stance.After meeting with Mr. Obama, the Vermont senator went to Capitol Hill for an hourlong session with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Mr. Reid suggested to reporters afterward that Mr. Sanders accepts that the race is over. ""I didn't hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she is the nominee,"" Mr. Reid said.A House member who had endorsed Mr. Sanders, Peter Welch of Vermont, said Thursday he believes Mr. Sanders grasps that he has lost and won't try to change the minds of superdelegates.

But neither did he speak of Mrs. Clinton as a competitor, emphasizing that he planned to meet with her ""in the near future to see how we can work together to defeat Donald Trump and to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1%.""Democratic officials are treating Mr. Sanders with care. They need his help in the general election and don't wish to antagonize him as he comes to terms with the outcome of the primary contest. Party leaders are taking pains to praise Mr. Sanders for waging a surprisingly competitive, yearlong campaign.In his video endorsing Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama commended Mr. Sanders for mobilizing young voters and ""shining a spotlight on issues like income inequality.""For his part, Mr. Reid praised the energy that Mr. Sanders brought to the campaign trail and empathized with the candidate.""During the conversation, I said, 'Bernie, I don't understand the depth of your feelings, but I have some understanding,' "" Mr. Reid said, describing the loss of a 1974 Senate race early in his career by only hundreds of votes. ""I understand a little bit what you are going through.""After seeing Mr. Reid, Mr. Sanders met privately with Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is presumed to become the Senate Democratic leader when Mr. Reid retires at the end of the congressional session. ""I told him I was proud of him and what he accomplished,"" Mr. Schumer said. Referring to Mr. Sanders and his wife, he added: ""And you could see on his face and on Jane's face--they're proud, too.""At a rally outside Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., Thursday evening, Mr. Sanders gave his normal stump speech, focusing on issues of income inequality and criminal justice reform.

Barack Obama Endorses Hillary Clinton for President; Mr. Obama calls on Democratic Party to unite around Mrs. Clinton after meeting with Bernie Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795326184?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--No sitting U.S. president in recent history has campaigned for his party's nominee as much as Barack Obama plans to for Hillary Clinton.Mr. Obama endorsed the presumptive Democratic nominee on Thursday in a video posted on social media. Her campaign also announced plans for a joint appearance with the president next Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., kicking off a marathon push to retain Democratic control of the White House.""I'm fired up,"" Mr. Obama said in the video, echoing a chant from his 2008 campaign.The announcements came just 90 minutes after Mrs. Clinton's primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, emerged from a White House meeting with Mr. Obama, where the Vermont lawmaker gave his strongest signal yet that he wouldn't try to block her nomination at the July convention in Philadelphia.The political co-dependency between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, onetime rivals, is a reflection of how much of the president's legacy hinges on his former secretary of state winning the November election and the reality that his standing among voters is higher than hers.Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump responded to the endorsement Thursday with a tweet. ""Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama--but nobody else does!"" it said.Mr. Obama's popularity hovers around 50% in recent polls, yet voters have a more favorable view of him than of Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump, who has struggled to unify Republicans behind his candidacy.""It means something for him to say she is everything she says she will be, because he was a doubter,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, noting that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton were not natural allies.Mark Mellman, a Democratic polling expert, said that for Mr. Obama, the potential reward is greater than any risk. ""The peril for any president is you get too involved and lose and have it tarnish your legacy,"" he said. But if Mr. Obama stayed idle and Mrs. Clinton lost, he would take a hit anyway, Mr. Mellman added, and the president's policy would be at risk, too.Mr. Trump said last week that Mr. Obama shouldn't get involved in the race, warning that ""if he campaigns, that means I'm allowed to hit him.""More* Clinton Turns Up Heat on Trump With 'Delete Your Account' Tweet* Sanders Vows to Compete in Primary* Clinton Hits Trump on EconomicsVice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren quickly threw their public support behind Mrs. Clinton after Mr. Obama's endorsement. Mr. Biden, in an off-the-cuff comment during a speech Thursday night, said ""God willing"" the next president will be Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Obama faces several challenges. He must try to energize his supporters to vote in a race where he isn't on the ballot. He will also have to persuade voters who view him favorably, but Mrs. Clinton negatively, to back her anyway, and he must unite the Democratic Party after a far-tougher-than-expected primary battle.Mr. Obama made headway Thursday in unifying the party, as Mr. Sanders emerged from their meeting thanking the president for his ""impartiality"" in the primary race and said he would soon meet with Mrs. Clinton to discuss how to defeat Mr. Trump in November.Yet Mr. Obama has been unable to convince voters to turn out for Democrats in elections when he wasn't on the ballot.During his tenure, Democrats have suffered setbacks up and down the ballot, losing dozens of seats and control of both chambers in Congress and 10 governorships.In 2014, while ranking lower in popularity polls than he does currently, Mr. Obama campaigned for nine Democratic candidates; five of them lost. In addition, many Democrats didn't want to be seen with him, and he was frustrated about being sidelined.David Axelrod, who was an adviser to both Obama campaigns, said the electorate is different--larger and more diverse--in presidential years, and that voters in 2008 and 2012 weren't just turning out for Mr. Obama. ""There's no question that part of what brought people out was him, but a lot of what brought people out were shared values and concerns,"" Mr. Axelrod said.Not since 1988 has a party won three consecutive terms in the White House. But many of the factors that kept the president's predecessors off the campaign trail or largely invisible don't apply to Mr. Obama.President George W. Bush had approval ratings below 30% in 2008, and the Republican nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, kept as big a distance from him as possible. President Bill Clinton had overseen significant economic prosperity, but had been tarred by scandal before the 2000 campaign, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, decided he should run as his own man.President Ronald Reagan campaigned for his vice president, George H.W. Bush, in 1988, but the Republican nominee sought to emphasize that he wasn't running for Mr. Reagan's third term.Mrs. Clinton, however, has embraced Mr. Obama's legacy and has pledged to build on much of his policy agenda.""I'm excited about having the president's support, because I have said throughout this campaign, I was honored to serve in the president's cabinet as his secretary of state,"" Mrs. Clinton told reporters this week. ""I don't think he's gotten the credit he deserves for saving the economy from the great recession that it was experiencing when he became president.""Mr. Obama is equally invested in the November election. Almost all of the policies he implemented in his second term were done through executive power--from the Iran nuclear deal to domestic and international climate-change initiatives--making much of his legacy dependent on the next president continuing his programs.The president will be deployed to energize the Democratic coalition that twice won him the White House, including young voters, African-Americans, Latinos and women. Vice President Biden and first lady Michelle Obama also are expected to stump for Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Obama will have the benefit of the tools of incumbency usually employed to boost a president's re-election campaign, such as holding official White House events that target key constituencies. A White House summit next week focusing on women, for instance, spotlights a core part of the Obama coalition.Mr. Obama plans to spend a lot of time campaigning online for Mrs. Clinton, aides said. He intends to take an optimistic tone and outline what he sees as the two paths for the country under the Republican and Democratic nominees, they said.In 1988, Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush and their advisers coordinated closely, looking for opportunities to deploy the president, said Craig Fuller, who was Mr. Bush's chief of staff.In the fall, Mr. Reagan began crisscrossing the country making campaign appearances. He also helped deliver critical votes in Southern California that captured the Golden State for Mr. Bush, said Ken Duberstein, who was the president's chief of staff.Mr. Duberstein cast doubt on whether Mr. Obama could help Democrats accomplish that same feat. ""Under Reagan, it became 'Morning in America again' ... America was feeling good about itself,"" he said.In 2000, Mr. Gore called upon Mr. Clinton sparingly--a decision that was both complicated and controversial.

"How Millennials Can Still Live Bernie's Dream; Check out this federal experiment in socialism. Free education, free single-payer health care. Forty days of paid leave. Sounds Nordic, but it's all-American!",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795288200?accountid=12768,"They backed him over Hillary Clinton in greater numbers than they backed Barack Obama over John McCain. But now, millions of millennials are left licking their wounds after the defeat of Bernie Sanders, the greatest progressive hero since the president he wanted to replace.Many of them recoil at the thought of supporting Mrs. Clinton, a liberal but one with insufficient anticapitalist bona fides. For now, the Bernie-backers' dream of grafting Scandinavian solutions onto American problems is dead.Or is it? Despite some recent budgetary setbacks, a long-running American experiment in socialism is still going strong, and yet somehow it remains one of the country's best-kept secrets.The federal experiment involves 1.3 million Americans--less than 1% of the population, but 75% of the participants are themselves millennials, so Bernie's supporters should feel right at home. Unless they feel like they've arrived in socialist heaven. Consider:These lucky few, including their spouses and children, receive free single-payer health care. Pre-existing conditions? No problem. Prescriptions? Generally free.Bernie only proposed free college for all; that's already a reality for these young Americans. Local elementary schooling for their children is also tossed in at no cost. Vocational training? When do you want to start? And put your wallet away.What's more, the federal government provides these participants with generous living allowances. On top of their normal salaries, they collect a monthly allowance for rent or mortgage payments, an allowance for moving costs incurred when their job location changes, and an allowance for gas consumed when driving for work-related purposes. There's even a clothing allowance. Oh, none of these allowances is taxable. Did I mention that tax preparation services are also free?In case you thought it couldn't get any more Nordic for these chosen few, they get 30 days of paid vacation a year in addition to the usual 10 paid federal holidays. That's 40 days of paid leave every year--more than in the Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.These Americans are also eligible for a lifetime pension. If they enter the program after high school, they can start collecting their retirement--half the dollar amount of their final salary, every year for the rest of their life--at age 38! Not even Bernie thought of that. The amount they collect is calculated annually according to the Consumer Price Index and the effects of inflation, so the pension payments increase each year as the cost of living rises.Speaking of salaries: No gender pay gap here. A male who occupies the same position with the same experience cannot earn more than his female colleague. That's the rule, not subject to the whim of a paymaster.So come on over, disappointed young Bernie fans. Someone's already living your dream. There is one catch: Occasionally the program can get a bit dangerous, and you'll be beyond the reach of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Welcome to the U.S. Armed Forces, my fellow millennials.

Barack Obama Endorses Hillary Clinton for President; Mr. Obama calls on Democratic Party to unite around Mrs. Clinton after meeting with Bernie Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795056867?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--No sitting U.S. president in recent history has campaigned for his party's nominee as much as Barack Obama plans to for Hillary Clinton.Mr. Obama endorsed the presumptive Democratic nominee on Thursday in a video posted on social media. Her campaign also announced plans for a joint appearance with the president next Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., kicking off a marathon push to retain Democratic control of the White House.""I'm fired up,"" Mr. Obama said in the video, echoing a chant from his 2008 campaign.The announcements came just 90 minutes after Mrs. Clinton's primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, emerged from a White House meeting with Mr. Obama, where the Vermont lawmaker gave his strongest signal yet that he wouldn't try to block her nomination at the July convention in Philadelphia.The political co-dependency between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, onetime rivals, is a reflection of how much of the president's legacy hinges on his former secretary of state winning the November election and the reality that his standing among voters is higher than hers.Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump responded to the endorsement Thursday with a tweet. ""Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama--but nobody else does!"" it said.Mr. Obama's popularity hovers around 50% in recent polls, yet voters have a more favorable view of him than of Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump, who has struggled to unify Republicans behind his candidacy.""It means something for him to say she is everything she says she will be, because he was a doubter,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, noting that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton were not natural allies.Mark Mellman, a Democratic polling expert, said that for Mr. Obama, the potential reward is greater than any risk. ""The peril for any president is you get too involved and lose and have it tarnish your legacy,"" he said. But if Mr. Obama stayed idle and Mrs. Clinton lost, he would take a hit anyway, Mr. Mellman added, and the president's policy would be at risk, too.Mr. Trump said last week that Mr. Obama shouldn't get involved in the race, warning that ""if he campaigns, that means I'm allowed to hit him.""More* Clinton Turns Up Heat on Trump With 'Delete Your Account' Tweet* Sanders Vows to Compete in Primary* Clinton Hits Trump on EconomicsMr. Obama faces several challenges. He must try to energize his supporters to vote in a race where he isn't on the ballot. He will also have to persuade voters who view him favorably, but Mrs. Clinton negatively, to back her anyway, and he must unite the Democratic Party after a far-tougher-than-expected primary battle.Mr. Obama made headway Thursday in unifying the party, as Mr. Sanders emerged from their meeting thanking the president for his ""impartiality"" in the primary race and said he would soon meet with Mrs. Clinton to discuss how to defeat Mr. Trump in November.Yet Mr. Obama has been unable to convince voters to turn out for Democrats in elections when he wasn't on the ballot.During his tenure, Democrats have suffered setbacks up and down the ballot, losing dozens of seats and control of both chambers in Congress and 10 governorships.In 2014, while ranking lower in popularity polls than he does currently, Mr. Obama campaigned for nine Democratic candidates; five of them lost. In addition, many Democrats didn't want to be seen with him, and he was frustrated about being sidelined.David Axelrod, who was an adviser to both Obama campaigns, said the electorate is different--larger and more diverse--in presidential years, and that voters in 2008 and 2012 weren't just turning out for Mr. Obama. ""There's no question that part of what brought people out was him, but a lot of what brought people out were shared values and concerns,"" Mr. Axelrod said.Not since 1988 has a party won three consecutive terms in the White House. But many of the factors that kept the president's predecessors off the campaign trail or largely invisible don't apply to Mr. Obama.President George W. Bush had approval ratings below 30% in 2008, and the Republican nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, kept as big a distance from him as possible. President Bill Clinton had overseen significant economic prosperity, but had been tarred by scandal before the 2000 campaign, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, decided he should run as his own man.President Ronald Reagan campaigned for his vice president, George H.W. Bush, in 1988, but the Republican nominee sought to emphasize that he wasn't running for Mr. Reagan's third term.Mrs. Clinton, however, has embraced Mr. Obama's legacy and has pledged to build on much of his policy agenda.""I'm excited about having the president's support, because I have said throughout this campaign, I was honored to serve in the president's cabinet as his secretary of state,"" Mrs. Clinton told reporters this week. ""I don't think he's gotten the credit he deserves for saving the economy from the great recession that it was experiencing when he became president.""Mr. Obama is equally invested in the November election. Almost all of the policies he implemented in his second term were done through executive power--from the Iran nuclear deal to domestic and international climate-change initiatives--making much of his legacy dependent on the next president continuing his programs.The president will be deployed to energize the Democratic coalition that twice won him the White House, including young voters, African-Americans, Latinos and women. Vice President Joe Biden and first lady Michelle Obama also are expected to stump for Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Obama will have the benefit of the tools of incumbency usually employed to boost a president's re-election campaign, such as holding official White House events that target key constituencies. A White House summit next week focusing on women, for instance, spotlights a core part of the Obama coalition.Mr. Obama plans to spend a lot of time campaigning online for Mrs. Clinton, aides said. He intends to take an optimistic tone and outline what he sees as the two paths for the country under the Republican and Democratic nominees, they said.In 1988, Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush and their advisers coordinated closely, looking for opportunities to deploy the president, said Craig Fuller, who was Mr. Bush's chief of staff.In the fall, Mr. Reagan began crisscrossing the country making campaign appearances. He also helped deliver critical votes in Southern California that captured the Golden State for Mr. Bush, said Ken Duberstein, who was the president's chief of staff.Mr. Duberstein cast doubt on whether Mr. Obama could help Democrats accomplish that same feat. ""Under Reagan, it became 'Morning in America again' ... America was feeling good about itself,"" he said.In 2000, Mr. Gore called upon Mr. Clinton sparingly--a decision that was both complicated and controversial. Mr. Clinton wanted to spend more time on the campaign trail, but the president's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky was still fresh in voters' minds, and Mr. Gore was eager to establish his own separate political identity, former aides said.Bob Shrum, a longtime Democratic strategist who served as an adviser to Mr. Gore, said he poll-tested the prospect of sending Mr. Clinton to battleground states and found strong evidence that the president would be more hindrance than help.Mr. Clinton's ""argument was, if only we had sent him out there, everything would be fine,"" Mr. Shrum recalled.

Bernie Sanders on Thursday vowed to compete in the final Democratic presidential primary next week in Washington, D.C., but also hinted that he was ready to wind down his candidacy as party officials rallied behind Hillary Clinton.Mr. Sanders spent the day in Washington, meeting privately with President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Senate colleagues. Party leaders urged him to accept defeat and help unite Democrats for the general-election showdown with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama congratulated and complimented Mr. Sanders on his campaign. Mr. Earnest called it ""a friendly conversation that was focused on the future."" An hour after the Oval Office visit, Mr. Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton in a video released by her campaign.In another sign the party is coalescing behind Mrs. Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a hero of the liberal Democratic wing, was set to endorse Mrs. Clinton Thursday evening. MSNBC put out a statement that the Massachusetts senator would announce her endorsement on the network. The endorsement might prove particularly valuable to Mrs. Clinton, given Ms. Warren's credibility with the legions of young, liberal voters who gravitated toward Mr. Sanders.Before California and five other states voted Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said he would carry his fight to the party's national convention next month in Philadelphia, trying to flip superdelegates loyal to Mrs. Clinton. That calculation may have changed.After losses in California, New Jersey and two other states that day, Mr. Sanders seems to be rethinking that stance.After meeting with Mr. Obama, the Vermont senator went to Capitol Hill for an hourlong session with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Mr. Reid suggested to reporters afterward that Mr. Sanders accepts that the race is over. ""I didn't hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she is the nominee,"" Mr. Reid said.A House member who had endorsed Mr. Sanders, Peter Welch of Vermont, said Thursday he believes Mr. Sanders grasps that he has lost and won't try to change the minds of superdelegates. ""It's clear that Hillary Clinton is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party,"" Mr. Welch said in an interview. ""We all know that. Sen. Sanders knows that.""Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Obama Endorses Clinton for President* Clinton Hits Trump on Economics* Trump Will Consult Congress, Agencies On Iran Deal and Muslim Ban, Adviser Says* The Map: Trump Says He Can Win New States for GOP, but Clinton Has the Edge* Hillary Clinton v.

But neither did he speak of Mrs. Clinton as a competitor, emphasizing that he planned to meet with her ""in the near future to see how we can work together to defeat Donald Trump and to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1%.""Democratic officials are treating Mr. Sanders with care. They need his help in the general election and don't wish to antagonize him as he comes to terms with the outcome of the primary contest. Party leaders are taking pains to praise Mr. Sanders for waging a surprisingly competitive, yearlong campaign.In his video endorsing Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama commended Mr. Sanders for mobilizing young voters and ""shining a spotlight on issues like income inequality.""For his part, Mr. Reid praised the energy that Mr. Sanders brought to the campaign trail and empathized with the candidate.""During the conversation, I said, 'Bernie, I don't understand the depth of your feelings, but I have some understanding,' "" Mr. Reid said, describing the loss of a 1974 Senate race early in his career by only hundreds of votes. ""I understand a little bit what you are going through.""After seeing Mr. Reid, Mr. Sanders met privately with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is presumed to become the Senate Democratic leader when Mr. Reid retires at the end of the congressional session. ""I told him I was proud of him and what he accomplished,"" Mr. Schumer said. Referring to Mr. Sanders and his wife, he added: ""And you could see on his face and on Jane's face--they're proud, too.""Carol E. Lee contributed to this article.Write to Carol E.

"Bernie Should Hold Out; Bernie Sanders has reimagined the Democratic Party. For that, he deserves something big.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794667441?accountid=12768,"There is a reason why Hillary Clinton's milestone as the U.S.'s first female presidential nominee is having trouble reaching elevation. The reason is that her victory is not the most significant event of the Democratic primaries.The real claim to Democratic Party history belongs to Bernie Sanders. Sen. Sanders has recentered the Democrats, once and for all, as a party of the political left. He has reimagined the Democrats--almost with the force of his personality--as a party of the state, of government and of redistribution. Period.Barack Obama himself became a Bernista in his June 1 speech in Elkhart, Ind., when he essentially proposed delinking Social Security's benefits from any known economic reality.The party of Franklin Roosevelt through Lyndon Johnson and its alliance with private-sector industrial unions made Democrats aware that their fortunes ultimately were joined to the success of the private sector.The Democrats are now the party of Bernie Sanders, the progressive icon Sen. Elizabeth Warren and--make no mistake--of Barack Obama, a man of the left from day one. Rather than distrust the private sector, they disdain and even loathe it.In this milieu, Hillary Clinton was the odd woman out. If she'd had any credibility as an authentic member of the party's new Sanders-Warren center, she would have overwhelmed this obscure Vermont senator in the Iowa caucuses. Instead, liberals under 40, especially millennials, don't believe she is one of them.The policies of John Kennedy and Bill Clinton, now in disrepute, ensured that annual economic growth remained at its postwar average of about 3%. Those Democrats understood the private sector, even if they distrusted it.That understanding is gone, as proven by the seven-year Obama growth rate between zero and little more than 2%. If Hillary Clinton utters the phrase ""corporate tax reform,"" she will lose the election. The Sanders wing of the Obama coalition will walk away from her.In the new Democratic Party, defined by the substance of Sen. Sanders's campaign, the role of the private sector is to transmit revenue to the public purse. Private business has become an exotic abstraction, like the province of Cappadocia in the Roman empire.As the Obama presidency made clear, this new relationship is not based on the tax code, which the new Democrats think of as a kind of dumb sump pump. The driver now is legal prosecution or the constant threat of it by government enforcement agencies--Justice, Labor, the NLRB, and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose originator was Elizabeth Warren.Ralph Nader this week told the Washington Post that Sen. Sanders had broken the taboo on the word ""socialism."" Bernie, said Mr. Nader, ""has brought the word into the mainstream and made class distinctions central to his campaign.""But not even Sen. Sanders uses the S-word much, preferring the euphemisms of ""income inequality"" and ""social justice,"" which are gentler on American ears. Mrs. Clinton will use most of the Sanders vocabulary.That said, many activists on the left believe, rightly, that they haven't gained permanent control of the party. They have its heart and soul, but the Sanders revolution doesn't yet command the power stations. Effective party power remains with what Sen. Sanders repeatedly calls the ""establishment.""But Bernie has something close to veto power. Sen. Sanders has disconnected Mrs. Clinton from most of the party's younger voters. They're listening to him, not her, and maybe not even to Barack Obama anymore. Indeed, one may ask whether the Democratic establishment abhorred by Sen. Sanders's base now includes Mr. Obama.All of which makes the scorpion dance over ""unifying the party"" between Sen. Sanders and bloodless Democratic heavyweights a show not to be missed.I am reminded of the Corleone family in ""The Godfather--II"" when Tom Hagen tells Frankie Pentangeli it's time to go. I see Harry Reid as making the Hagen buyout offer to Bernie.Tom Hagen: ""When a plot against the emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.Frankie Pentangeli: ""Yeah, but only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off.""But Bernie isn't in Frankie Pentangeli's bathtub by himself. A whole generation of young Democratic voters--who see Hillary and what she represents as the moribund empire and themselves as the little guys--will be watching the deal the party offers to make Bernie go.Bernie's brigades should hold out for more than writing platform boilerplate. If Sen. Sanders forced Hillary to pick Elizabeth Warren as her running mate, it would be the capstone to Bernie's career. History would record him as someone who decisively shifted the locus of a major American party, rather than just another eccentric candidate who briefly caught fire.Plus, we'd get the spectacle of Donald Trump battling two women, not least Sen. Warren, progressivism's central processing unit.We are all in a five-month skydive, so it might as well be fun. Even for Bernie Sanders.Write to henninger@wsj.comCredit: By Daniel Henninger",6/10/16
Election 2016: Democrats Spar in New York --- Clinton clarifies her minimum-wage plan as rival Sanders calls it 'not good enough',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781478892?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- The Democratic presidential candidates returned to the campaign trail Sunday in New York City for a two-day sprint to Tuesday's primary here, with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders exchanging tough words across town.By day's end, Mrs. Clinton and her husband, the former president, had between them touched all five boroughs, plus suburban spots in Westchester County and Long Island, blanketing the metro area that will deliver as much as 70% of Tuesday's vote. Along the way she danced to Latin rhythms at a campaign block party.Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, addressed a record-breaking crowd in a Brooklyn park. He also appeared at a public housing complex, released a plan for affordable housing and spoke at a Harlem church service.Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, needs a big win in New York if he is to have any chance of closing Mrs. Clinton's lead in delegates. For Mrs. Clinton, who polls show is maintaining a double-digit lead, it would be deeply embarrassing to lose in her adopted home state where she had served as a senator.Both candidates were back in New York after more than a day away from the state -- Mr. Sanders to the Vatican for a conference and a brief greeting with Pope Francis, and Mrs. Clinton for fundraisers including a high-dollar event at the California home of actor George Clooney.The day began with both candidates appearing on Sunday talk shows. Speaking on ABC, Mrs. Clinton sought to clarify her position when she said she backed a minimum-wage increase modeled after New York's $15-an-hour plan, which will be phased in and sensitive to local economic conditions.""We have to evaluate it as we go,"" she said. ""If the Congress passes that, of course I would sign it.""The racial diversity of the Clinton coalition was on display Sunday as she began her day at a suburban African-American church, then campaigned in the largely Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights, in northern Manhattan. Most of the politicians who preceded her spoke in Spanish to a crowd that included many people who spoke little English.After Mrs. Clinton's brief remarks, peppy merengue music played and the former secretary of state began bouncing to the beat. As her hands waved in the air, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat took them into his own and then twirled around her.From there, she traveled to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, where a largely African-American crowd chanted ""Madam President!""She took several shots at Mr. Sanders. ""It's easy to diagnose the problem. You've got to be able to solve the problem,"" she said. She lingered over the issue of gun control, a subject where the Clinton campaign believes Mr. Sanders is vulnerable.Mr. Sanders on Sunday released an affordable housing plan that would expand a federal trust fund created in 2008 to finance such projects. He also called for promoting homeownership by expanding government-backed lending programs that allow borrowers to make small or no down payments.Several other proposals overlap with those that Mrs. Clinton unveiled earlier this year. Both candidates support tougher curbs on predatory lending and expanded counseling for first-time home buyers.At the center of Mrs. Clinton's plan, unveiled in February, is a $25 billion housing investment program that would build more affordable rental housing and boost homeownership for low-income Americans by matching up to $10,000 in savings for a down payment.Later in the day, Mr. Sanders addressed more than 28,000 people under the bright sun in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, in what the campaign said was a record turnout. He laid into Mrs. Clinton on the familiar issues of fracking for energy, trade, her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and the minimum wage. He said her $12 wage-floor proposal was ""not bad, but not good enough. We need to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.""---Nick Timiraos contributed to this article.Credit: By Laura Meckler and Erica Orden",6/13/16
Cardinal Bernie,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781478793?accountid=12768,"In the 1600s the sculptor Bernini had Pope Urban VIII as his benefactor. Today Bernie Sanders wants to claim Pope Francis. In the pope's second foray into American presidential politics -- the first was to suggest Donald Trump is not a Christian -- Francis met with the Democratic Party's socialist underdog on Saturday.Mr. Sanders's audience was granted after he participated in a Vatican conference celebrating the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's encyclical Centesimus Annus. In his remarks on the encyclical, Mr. Sanders used his Vatican pulpit to declare that ""the issue of wealth and income inequality"" is ""the great moral issue of our time.""The irony is that Senator Sanders seems to be completely unaware that Centesimus Annus was one of the most pro-market documents ever to come out of the Vatican. While it certainly carries warnings about a capitalism unbounded by law and a healthy culture, it also spoke eloquently of the ""human rights to private initiative, to ownership of property and to freedom in the economic sector.""As for socialism, the encyclical was unsparing. Pope John Paul II agreed with earlier popes that socialism fails as a political system because it is rooted in the denial of freedom. So perhaps it's useful for Mr. Sanders to spend time with Centesimus Annus, assuming he reads enough to see its denunciations of socialism and appreciation for what human creativity can accomplish in a free-market economy.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Bernie Is Softish on Income Inequality With His Money"" -- WSJ Apr. 27, 2016)",6/13/16
"Election 2016: Sanders, Clinton Backed Disputed Law --- Crime measure from 1994 is blamed by some for high prison rates for minority men",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781140717?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, embroiled in a contentious New York primary, have been calling for changes to a criminal-justice system they say unfairly targets minorities. But both supported the landmark 1994 law that critics say helped foster the system they now attack.The eruption of the 22-year-old crime law into the 2016 presidential campaign highlights a striking shift in the nation's priorities and political landscape over the past two decades. That is creating particular challenges for Mrs. Clinton, the spouse of a president who approved the law two decades ago.""I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and have had a very unfortunate impact on peoples' lives,"" said Mrs. Clinton during Thursday's Democratic debate in New York.Mr. Sanders said during the debate that ""what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.""A testy exchange in Philadelphia recently between President Bill Clinton and a protester from the Black Lives Matter movement highlighted the issue. The protester blamed the crime law for the rise in incarceration, primarily of young black men, that critics say has left millions of people struggling to recover economically and socially.Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said anger over the criminal justice system's impact on minority communities is well-placed. ""We've sort of blithely gone along all these years and let our prison population get bigger and bigger, and the impact has been felt most acutely by communities of color, particularly African-American men,"" said Mr. Travis, who directed the Justice Department's research arm in the Clinton years.But Mr. Travis said it is simplistic to blame Mr. Clinton and the 1994 crime bill for the growth in the prison population. ""I am not sure there is a singular villain in this drama,"" he said.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who pushed for even tougher measures at the time, said the environment was completely different in the early 1990s. ""It's easy to forget what was going on,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Look at the current Chicago shooting and murder rate -- that was across the whole country."" Chicago has recently seen a jump in homicides.Mr. Gingrich, a Republican, defended Mr. Clinton's initial response to the Philadelphia protester, in which he pointed out that many of the crime wave's victims were black. ""The people being killed in Philadelphia and New York were overwhelmingly minorities,"" Mr. Gingrich said.The term ""super-predator"" also entered the lexicon at the time, describing a group of young people who ostensibly were particularly remorseless. Many have since questioned the concept, and Mrs. Clinton recently expressed regret for using the term.The issue is becoming especially heated as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders appeal for minority votes. But the Clinton crime bill was only one of the era's tough laws spawned by fear of crime. By 1994, the prison population was already growing, in part because of changes to state laws that stiffened sentences.Congress had also taken similar measures, including the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which abolished parole in the federal system, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which created mandatory minimum drug sentences.From 1980 to 1993, according to Justice Department estimates, the total corrections population -- those on probation, parole, in state and federal prisons or in jail -- rose to 4.9 million from 1.8 million. The prison population alone nearly tripled, to 969,300 from 329,800.That reflected the national mood. By 1994, the nation was inundated with news footage of crime scenes, blanket-covered bodies and grieving families, primarily in inner-city minority neighborhoods, as battles erupted over control of the crack cocaine trade.The FBI estimated that over 72,000 people, nearly half of them African-American, were murdered between 1991 and 1993. ""Soft on crime"" became an epithet politicians avoided at all costs.In contrast, the past two decades have seen plummeting crime rates, along with the rise of competing national priorities, especially terrorism and the economy.At the same time, black leaders, and officeholders across the political spectrum, have become alarmed at the high incarceration rate and relations between police and minorities.Now, the view is widespread among Democrats and liberals that the 1994 law was flawed.Ronald Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore School of Law, said the legislation had attracted a clash of competing interests, creating ""this ill-considered parade of ideas often not vetted through the committees of jurisdiction."" Mr. Weich was then counsel to Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), a key player on criminal justice issues who supported the final measure.The finished product had good and bad points, Mr. Weich said, and Mr. Clinton urgently sought its passage as he headed into tough midterm elections.Mr. Clinton wanted 100,000 more police officers on the street. Democrats including Mr. Kennedy sought gun-control provisions. Republicans wanted stiffer penalties.Many of these provisions, including an assault-weapons ban, became part of the crime law, as did a measure giving some sentencing relief to minor players in drug enterprises.But the law also created new criminal offenses and expanded the federal death penalty. More significantly, it provided grants for states that required prisoners to serve more time by reducing parole and early release, an approach supporters called ""truth in sentencing.""Credit: By Gary Fields",6/13/16
Bernie's Spinal Surgery on CEOs,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781094210?accountid=12768,"Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam is receiving hosannas for his takedown Wednesday of Bernie Sanders, in which he rapped the presidential candidate's views on corporate America as ""uninformed,"" ""contemptible,"" and ""wrong"" -- among other things. He'd be worthy of even more praise had he also applied those words to the ""Not I"" business community that helped create this moment.Mr. McAdam is right that Mr. Sanders is wrong. American businesses aren't immoral. They create jobs, prosperity, investment and tax revenue. They are the essence and the requirement of a democracy. Far from an immoral system, U.S. capitalism is the wonder and envy of the world. The greater wonder is that it remains so, despite the pusillanimous behavior of its most prominent representatives.It has been many a year since corporate America could claim to have an intact spinal system, though its retreat into nervelessness has accelerated over the past decade. We've reached a moment at which Mr. Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren can daily tar companies as the villains of the world, and receive applause from voters both left and right. Blame it on the great recession; blame it on a litigious environment; blame it on President Obama. But mostly blame it on the companies themselves. When asked time and again who among them would stand up for the American way, they mumbled ""Not I.""This is the corporate America (Alcoa, Duke Energy, Pacific Gas and Electric, General Electric) that rushed to curry favor with the green left, forming the Climate Action Partnership in 2007 in hopes of rigging any coming carbon caps in its favor. It's the corporate America (Exelon, Nike, Apple) that folded like an accordion when the Chamber of Commerce questioned President Obama's plan to impose a climate program by EPA fiat. It's the corporate America (Google, Facebook, eBay) that ditched the free-market American Legislative Exchange Council when that group came under fire from environmental activists. Who will stand up for low-cost energy, or consumers, or principle? ""Not I.""It's the corporate America (Pfizer, the American Medical Association, America's Health Insurance Plans) that sold out health care to the Obama administration, each company and trade organization hoping to cut its own special deal. It's the Solyndras and Fisker Automotives and A123 Systems that sucked up stimulus money and left taxpayers with the bill. It's the Boeings and Caterpillars that insist on subsidies from the Export-Import Bank. It's the car companies that folded to higher mileage standards, the Internet companies that folded to net neutrality, the agribusinesses that finagled expensive ethanol mandates, and the big retailers that push for Internet taxation to hobble smaller competitors. Who will stand up for free markets? ""Not I.""True, trade groups are often to be found in the trenches of Congress, fighting the worst regulations or bills, maybe even running a TV ad or two. Then again, trade groups are also convenient places for CEOs to hide their policy efforts, a way of outsourcing the dirty job to an acronym.Who was the last prominent CEO to go on an extended public riff about the evils of Dodd-Frank, or the ridiculousness of the ""equal pay"" debate, or the nonsense that is Obama energy policy? ""Not I, not I, not I.""These are the companies that play the 55-45 game, dividing their political giving nearly equally between the party that supports their free-market interests and the party that routinely refers them to the Justice Department. Some firms -- particularly in finance -- believe it is better to try to buy off the enemy with contributions (beat us only gently, please) than to draw criticism for supporting a free-market candidate.So today, on the stump, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton routinely call for the jailing of executives. Bernie pitches single-payer health care as a fix to ObamaCare. Hillary calls for expanding paid vacation and maternity leave. Both candidates want to double regulations on Wall Street, hike taxes, raise the minimum wage, increase union payoffs, and make energy unaffordable. They brand companies that do business overseas as traitors and sellouts.Mr. McAdam is now speaking out. He follows General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who recently refuted Mr. Sanders's assertion that companies are ""destroying the moral fabric of this country."" Exxon Mobil this week filed in state court a forceful rejoinder to the state attorneys general who are pursuing the bogus claim that the oil company suppressed climate science. This is all positive movement, though it comes only at extreme moments. The usual business behavior is to sit quiet, while expecting the free-market activists and congressmen (their Little Red Hens) to step up and defend them in proxy fights, or Congress, or the public sphere.Businesses have long justified this by noting that capitalism is rooted in self-interest, and that corporations are simply pursuing that interest when they dodge fights or engage in crony capitalism. But there's short-term self-interest and long-term self-interest. The long-term is now here, in the form of Bernie Sanders.---Write to kim@wsj.comLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint ServiceCredit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",6/13/16
Election 2016: War of Words Mounts in Democratic Race --- Sanders says Clinton unfit to be president after a headline said she said the same,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779338236?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- The Democratic race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders detoured Thursday from high-minded debate over issues into a he-said-she-said squabble ahead of the presidential primary fight for New York, a contest with outsize importance to both candidates.For Mr. Sanders, the state is a must-win if he is to have any chance of catching the Democratic front-runner. For Mrs. Clinton, a loss in her adopted home state in the April 19 primary would be deeply embarrassing.Those stakes help explain the sharp exchanges in recent days as both candidates launched aggressive New York campaigns, including new television ads with messages tailored to different parts of the state.Mr. Sanders charged that Mrs. Clinton wasn't qualified to be president -- but only, he said, because she said the same about him. But Mrs. Clinton hadn't called him unqualified; she declined to answer when pressed on the matter in an earlier TV interview.""If Secretary Clinton thinks that just because I'm from a small state in Vermont . . . they're going to beat us up and . . . we're not going to fight back . . . they can guess again,"" he told reporters in Philadelphiaon Thursday.Mrs. Clinton called the whole thing ""silly,"" even as her campaign sought to raise money off the claim that the former first lady, senator and secretary of state isn't prepared for the White House.Later Thursday, in an interview with CBS, Mr. Sanders repeated that he was only making charges against Mrs. Clinton because he believed she leveled them first toward him. He said he will ""certainly"" support her if she is the Democratic nominee, but when asked directly if he believes she is ""unqualified to be president,"" he replied, ""Well, does Secretary Clinton believe that I am unqualified to be president?""Mrs. Clinton has 1,280 pledged delegates, the type awarded by voters, to Mr. Sanders's 1,030. When superdelegates -- party leaders who can support anybody they like -- are included, she has 1,749 to his 1,061. A total of 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.After New York awards 291 delegates, there are just three large states left -- California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- and Mr. Sanders needs to win all four with large margins if he is to have any chance to catch her.Mrs. Clinton, who represented New York for eight years in the Senate and still calls the state home, begins with some clear advantages. New York primaries bar independent voters, who typically favor Mr. Sanders. And the electorate is expected to be about a third nonwhite, a group that has voted for Mrs. Clinton in previous contests.Recent public polling shows Mrs. Clinton with about a 10-point lead, but Mr. Sanders has shown he can catch up as voting approaches and more people get to know him.Each side has tailored one campaign for theNew York metropolitan area, which could account for as much as 70% of the electorate, and another for the rest of New York, known as upstate.Mrs. Clinton's New York City strategy centers on increasing turnout among black and Hispanic voters. On Sunday, she visited three African-American churches in Brooklyn, where she spoke about the importance of tackling ""systemic racism"" and the need for gun restrictions.One of three Clinton ads airing in the New York metro area is narrated by actor Morgan Freeman and is focused on victims of police violence and on her relationship with President Barack Obama. A second ad celebrates New York's diversity and hits Republican Donald Trump for his comments about Muslims and plans to build a wall along the Mexican border, another spot meant to motivate minority voters to back her.Upstate, her events and TV ads focus on her work to boost economic development when she was in the Senate, including advocating for the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and its thousands of high-tech jobs. On Friday, she will travel to Buffalo for an economic round table, and campaign in Rochester.Mr. Sanders, a Brooklyn native, is emphasizing his own New York roots. He pushed for a debate in Brooklyn, scheduled for next week. He drew 18,000 people to a rally in the Bronx last week and plans a large rally in Manhattan's Washington Square Park next week. Aides also note that eastern upstate New York borders Vermont, so people there have heard about him for years.In a New York City metro area that is home to some of the richest and the poorest Americans, Mr. Sanders will focus on income inequality, and on Mrs. Clinton's ties to Wall Street, said Tad Devine, his senior strategist.Thursday'stiff over whether Mrs. Clinton is qualified or not began when the New York Daily News published an interview with Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton was asked three times on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" whether, in light of the interview, she thinks he is qualified to be president.""I think the interview raised a lot of really serious questions,"" she said. ""I will leave it to voters to decide who of us can do the job that the country needs.""The Washington Post, writing about the interview, included a headline that said she had questioned whether he was qualified. Mr. Sanders seized on that.""When you have headlines in the Washington Post -- quote 'Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president,' my response is, well you know, if you want to question my qualifications let me suggest this, then maybe the American people might wonder about your qualifications, Madam Secretary,"" he said Thursday.He suggested her past support for trade agreements, her vote to authorize the Iraq war and support from Wall Street interests disqualified her for the job.Mrs. Clinton needs to drive up her support among women, particularly suburban women, a campaign adviser said. Mr. Sanders's comment could help with that, said George Arzt, a political consultant who is unaffiliated in the race.""I think there are many people who view Hillary -- whether they like her or not -- as the most experienced and qualified in the field,"" he said. ""There are many women who believe that the 'unqualified' title has been used too often against women looking for better jobs.""Credit: By Laura Meckler and Erica Orden",6/14/16
"Clinton Seeks Sanders Backing, Voter List; Democratic rivals scheduled to meet as Vermont senator resists falling in line",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796314610?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton wants rival Bernie Sanders to endorse her for president and deploy his email list to persuade his supporters to unite behind her, campaign advisers say, in hopes of bridging differences within the party and leaving Democrats best positioned to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the general election.But for now, Mr. Sanders is withholding his endorsement as he presses Mrs. Clinton and Democratic Party leaders to agree to some of the liberal policy goals and electoral changes he touted on the campaign trail, such as addressing income inequality and curtailing the role of money in politics.The two were to meet privately Tuesday night at a hotel near the White House as the last of the country's 57 Democratic nomination contests played out in Washington, D.C.The Washington results have no practical effect on the race. With a combination of 2,784 pledged and superdelegates ahead of the result, Mrs. Clinton has already become the party's presumptive nominee, having easily cleared the 2,383 delegate threshold.Hours before the meeting with Mrs. Clinton, the Vermont senator laid out specific requests that he said he would fight to enact at the Democratic convention next month in Philadelphia. While aides say his campaign is still ""active,"" they indicate that he accepts the mathematical realities and understands he can no longer wrest the nomination from Mrs. Clinton.Speaking outside a campaign office in Washington, Mr. Sanders called for the ouster of Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, depicting her as more focused on raising campaign funds than expanding the party and imbuing it with fresh energy.""We need a person at the leadership of the DNC who is vigorously supporting and out working to bring people into the political process,"" he said.Ms. Wasserman Schultz told MSNBC Tuesday she wouldn't step down.Mr. Sanders, who identified as an independent until entering the presidential race, also called for the elimination of superdelegates--the hundreds of party leaders and elected officials who have an outsize influence on the nomination. Party officials created the superdelegate system to head off debacles such as Democratic Sen. George McGovern's landslide defeat in 1972. The idea is that superdelegates could intervene should voters produce a nominee seen as unelectable.And Mr. Sanders said that Democrats at the convention should adopt a party platform that would amount to the ""most progressive"" ever passed in the party's history.Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) took part in a meeting at Mr. Sanders's home in Burlington, Vt., over the weekend to talk about his next steps.""He wants to spend a lot of time thinking about how to drive forward this agenda, to basically take on the big issues facing America,"" Mr. Merkley said in an interview.Clinton aides seem willing to accommodate Mr. Sanders up to a point. But they also stress it's incumbent on him to help mobilize his supporters. One step they see as helpful is Mr. Sanders using his email list to help make the case for victory over Mr. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump in recent polls, and was up by more than four points in the average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics.Mr. Sanders will be speaking to supporters via video message on Thursday evening to discuss his political future.""When we started this campaign, I told you that I run not to oppose any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching policies to deal with the crises of our time,"" said Mr. Sanders in a statement. ""After June 14, the voting is done, but our political revolution continues.""Both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton made appearances in the city last week in advance of the primary campaign, and touted their support for D.C. statehood, which would give city residents full representation in Congress. Mr. Sanders held a rally outside of RFK Stadium , drawing a large crowd that came to show its support for his candidacy.On Friday, Mrs. Clinton made a surprise appearance in a muffin shop in the city's rapidly developing Shaw neighborhood. She was flanked by city council members Jack Evans and Anita Bonds, as well as Washington's nonvoting delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton.Many supporters of both Democratic candidates in D.C. expressed an interest in putting the party's divisive primary battle behind them, looking to the general election fight with Mr. Trump.Casting a ballot at a middle school in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, Ziad Demian, 52 years old, a supporter of Mr. Sanders, said he was voting to help get his ideas into the party platform.""Hillary is not my favorite candidate, but the idea of somebody like Trump being representative of what this country stands for makes me sick,"" said Mr. Demian. ""If we don't vote altogether, it's pretty much given to Trump.""Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau",6/15/16
Sanders Supporters Press Party Leaders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779610097?accountid=12768,"Below the surface of the Democratic campaign, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders are waging a fierce battle over the party leaders who play an outsize role in picking the presidential nominee, the so-called superdelegates.Mr. Sanders and his backers are trying to cut into Mrs. Clinton's large lead in pledged delegates by prying away some of her superdelegates. Rank-and-file Sanders activists have taken it upon themselves to assist, using social media, emails and phone calls in ways that have created a backlash among the very people Mr. Sanders is hoping to win over.A California superdelegate backing Mrs. Clinton, Bob Mulholland, wrote a letter to Mr. Sanders this week saying the outreach to superdelegates from Sanders voters has gotten offensive, including calls coming late at night. Other superdelegates said they have gotten unwanted calls at work from Sanders backers, or have seen their Facebook pages flooded with warnings of political repercussions for supporting Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders is currently far behind among the superdelegates, most of whom get their convention votes by virtue of being elected officials and party leaders. At this point, a total of 469 superdelegates are backing Mrs. Clinton, and only 31 are supporting Mr. Sanders, according to an Associated Press tally. Another 214 have yet to express a preference.Overall, Mrs. Clinton leads the race by 1,749 delegates to Mr. Sanders's 1,061. With candidates needing 2,383 delegates to clinch, superdelegates have considerable influence in picking the nominee by dint of their numbers and because they can change their preference at any time. Their outsize role results from efforts by the party to head off long-shot candidates and avoid such landslide defeats as Sen. George McGovern's in 1972.Senior Sanders strategist Tad Devine said Thursday that, independent of the campaign's courtship of superdelegates, some Sanders enthusiasts have launched their own ""spontaneous"" effort to help the cause.""A lot of people are motivated to make the argument on behalf of Bernie,"" Mr. Devine said. ""We're not encouraging them in that; we're not organizing them,"" he said, adding that ""we're not discouraging them except if we hear of someone pushing a little too hard.""One argument the Sanders campaign is making to Clinton supporters: Superdelegates in states that voted for Mr. Sanders should back his candidacy so that they are in sync with voters. Yet the Sanders campaign also said it intends to court superdelegates in states that Mrs. Clinton won.A Clinton adviser said the Sanders strategy suggests the campaign recognizes it can't overtake her lead by any other means. ""The fact that they are articulating a path that relies on trying to wrest away superdelegates that have previously committed to us shows what dire straits they're in,"" said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.Mrs. Clinton's staff sends a regular email update to superdelegate supporters and arranges conference calls with senior aides. Having seen scores of superdelegates defect to Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, Mrs. Clinton is eager to keep her superdelegates in the fold this time around.One pro-Clinton superdelegate said a recent email message from her campaign included the line ""Feel the Math"" -- a play on the Sanders campaign's signature phrase, ""Feel the Bern,"" and a message that she enjoys a lead that Mr. Sanders will be hard-pressed to overcome.Mr. Sanders recently tapped Paul Kirk, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, to help court superdelegates. So far, Mr. Kirk said he is targeting the group who are as yet publicly uncommitted.The overtures from grass-roots supporters are more freewheeling. Sen. Maria Cantwell is a pro-Clinton superdelegate from Washington, a state won by Mr. Sanders with 72% of the caucus voters. Her Facebook page is awash in comments from Sanders supporters asking her to abandon Mrs. Clinton for the Vermont senator. A recent post by Ms. Cantwell congratulating the University of Washington women's basketball team for making the Final Four was greeted with comments from Sanders supporters skewering her for backing Ms. Clinton.""We are watching you, Sen. Maria Cantwell,"" one person wrote. ""Don't even think about going against the majority and backing HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] when your state wants Bernie Sanders.""A Cantwell spokesman said she is backing Mrs. Clinton because of positions the former secretary of state has taken on issues that are helpful to the state economy.Peggy Schaffer is a superdelegate from Maine, a state also won by Mr. Sanders. A longtime Clinton supporter, she said she will back whichever candidate winds up with the most pledged delegates in the end. Ms. Schaffer said Sanders supporters have launched a full-court press in her state, using emails, phone calls, letters and tweets to get her to back Mr. Sanders.At times, it can be uncomfortable. As a state employee, Ms. Schaffer isn't permitted to engage in political activities while on the job. But Mr. Sanders's backers repeatedly have called her work phone and have sent letters to her office.She has asked them to stop, but some have persisted. ""I wish some of them would tone it down a little,"" she said.Rep. Rick Nolan (D., Minn.) is an uncommitted superdelegate who has no plans to make a formal endorsement anytime soon. Mr. Sanders won the Minnesota caucus on March 1, and his supporters have been pressing the congressman.Joe Radinovich, the congressman's campaign manager, said Sanders backers have approached Mr. Nolan at political events, questioning why he hasn't sided with a candidate and making passionate pitches for their choice. One Sanders supporter who made a small donation to Mr. Nolan's campaign called and said he wouldn't make any more contributions unless the congressman supported Mr. Sanders. Mr. Nolan was unmoved by the threat, Mr. Radinovich said.Sanders supporters also have been a vocal presence on Mr. Nolan's Facebook page, responding to nearly every post with pleas for the congressman to back Mr. Sanders -- and suggestions that his political future hinges on his decision.Mr. Nolan has said little on the subject, but after reports emerged describing the congressman as a Clinton superdelegate, his campaign moved quickly to clarify, releasing a statement saying that he hasn't endorsed either Democratic presidential candidate.Dennis Archer, the former Detroit mayor, has been bombarded with emails from Sanders supporters in Michigan and across the country, urging him to switch his allegiance as a superdelegate. But Mr. Archer's friendship and working relationship with former President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton span decades, and he remains firmly committed to her.""She is the best-qualified candidate to be president of the United States, and therefore I'm supporting her, and I'm not going to change,"" Mr. Archer said.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Colleen McCain Nelson",6/15/16
Election 2016: Sanders Will Visit the Vatican --- Democratic candidate to leave the trail for a meeting on economic and social issues,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779610055?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will visit the Vatican next week to discuss themes of economic and social justice that are the centerpiece of his campaign.The Vermont senator said Friday that he would participate in an April 15 conference on social, economic and environmental issues at a Vatican academic organization, stepping off the campaign trail during the crucial last days before the New York primary.Mr. Sanders said he was ""moved"" by the invitation and said he deeply admired Pope Francis, whom he isn't expected to meet with on the trip. In an MSNBC interview Friday morning, he praised the pope's efforts to ""inject a sense of morality into how we do economics."" The pope has called for actions to address income inequality and has criticized American-style capitalism.The trip was announced as Mr. Sanders is looking to move past a tussle with his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, whom he denigrated this past week as ""unqualified"" for the presidency. He dialed back on those remarks Friday morning, saying ""of course"" Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, was qualified to be commander in chief.""On her worst day she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates,"" Mr. Sanders said on NBC, adding that the two Democratic candidates should focus on the issues instead of leveling personal attacks.Mrs. Clinton, asked Friday in Buffalo, N.Y., if Mr. Sanders was qualified to be president, affirmed that he was. ""As I said, I would take him over Donald Trump and Ted Cruz any day,"" she said.Mr. Sanders's visit to the Vatican could carry a political benefit, coming just days before the primary in heavily Catholic New York. About 30% of the state's adult population is Catholic, according to the Pew Research Center, versus about 20% of Americans overall.""I am a big, big fan of the pope,"" Mr. Sanders said on MSNBC on Friday. ""Obviously, there are areas where we disagree -- on women's rights or gay rights.""The contest in New York also has extra resonance for both candidates: Mrs. Clinton represented the state in the Senate for eight years before serving in the Obama administration, while Mr. Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn. Most polls show Mrs. Clinton with a lead in New York, and she has a sizable lead in convention delegates, although Mr. Sanders's recent primary wins have tightened that gap.Mr. Sanders is Jewish but hasn't made religion a centerpiece of either his campaign or his political identity, speaking only occasionally about his background.""I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being,"" he said at a Democratic debate earlier this year.The event at the Vatican will focus on creating an economy of ""dignity, social justice and environmental sustainability,"" the Sanders campaign said. Also listed on the program are Bolivian President Evo Morales and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa.The announcement of the trip was briefly the subject of a dispute between two officials within the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, the organization hosting the event.On Friday morning, Margaret Archer, the organization's president, told Bloomberg that Mr. Sanders had sought out the invitation to boost his campaign and accused him of a ""monumental discourtesy.""The Sanders campaign said it never sought the invitation, an account confirmed by Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.""The initiative did not come from the senator,"" he said in an interview. ""He was invited like all the other participants in the conference, in a letter from me as chancellor, writing in the name of the president."" Ms. Archer couldn't be reached for comment.---Francis X. Rocca in Vatican City contributed to this article.Credit: By Byron Tau",6/15/16
Bernie Sanders Makes Defeating Donald Trump a Top Priority; Vermont senator retains leverage by not endorsing Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797445451?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders said he would work feverishly to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the general election, urged his volunteers to run for elective office and said he would press Hillary Clinton to embrace a liberal policy agenda in a 23-minute speech to his supporters Thursday night.In the online speech Mr. Sanders neither endorsed Mrs. Clinton nor said he was ending his campaign, moves that might have drained his leverage in trying to shape the Democratic Party's future. But he made plain that one of his overriding goals is bringing about Mr. Trump's defeat.""The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly,"" said Mr. Sanders, who appeared by himself against a simple blue backdrop with his campaign logo. ""And I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time.""Mr. Sanders's plans have been a bit of a mystery since Mrs. Clinton last week secured the delegates making her the presumptive presidential nominee. The address offered few new insights into his future. Mr. Sanders's tone was somewhat wistful, celebrating a campaign that far surpassed expectations but fell short in the end. He said he won 22 state primaries and caucuses and, what's more, ""we came very close--within two points or less--in five more states.""What's clear is Mr. Sanders has accepted defeat and has given up plans to wrest the nomination from Mrs. Clinton. His new agenda, he said in the address, is to transform the political system and open the Democratic Party to new voters while pushing it in a leftward direction.He mentioned his private meeting earlier this week with Mrs. Clinton, in which the two erstwhile opponents began discussing ways to bridge differences.""I look forward, in the coming weeks to continued discussions between the two campaigns to make certain that your voices are heard and that the Democratic Party passes the most progressive platform in its history and that Democrats actually fight for that agenda,"" Mr. Sanders said.Looking ahead, he said he wants his campaign supporters to be at the vanguard of a 50-state strategy that would reverse Republican gains in statehouses and local offices .He urged viewers to visit his website and see how ""you can effectively run for office or get involved in politics at the local or state level.""Mr. Sanders delivered the speech from a studio in Burlington, Vt. His campaign said there were 218,000 viewers over the length of the address.The Clinton campaign had no comment after Mr. Sanders's speech.Ahead of the speech, many Sanders supporters were unclear about his future. Some wanted to see him stay in the race and fight for the nomination at the convention next month in Philadelphia. Others were moving on, rallying behind Mrs. Clinton.""His base is looking for signals about where he's going, what he's doing and what he's thinking,"" said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union that has been among Mr. Sanders's most ardent supporters. ""People are looking to Bernie for direction.""Having locked up the nomination, Mrs. Clinton's campaign began putting its imprint on the Democratic National Committee on Thursday, installing Brandon Davis as general election chief of staff. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook visited the DNC headquarters in Washington, D.C., to introduce Mr. Davis, who had been national political director for the Service Employees International Union. The union endorsed Mrs. Clinton last year.Not wanting to antagonize Sanders supporters, the DNC won't immediately recast itself as an arm of the campaign, a Clinton adviser said. Campaign officials are treating Mr. Sanders and his supporters carefully, hoping to win them over and unite the party for the general election fight against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Still, the Vermont senator doesn't have unlimited time to readjust. With each day, his leverage diminishes as the party coalesces behind Mrs. Clinton. The AFL-CIO, a coalition of labor unions that represents 12.5 million members, had been split during the primary; on Thursday, it endorsed the former secretary of state.And there are signs the Sanders coalition is breaking apart. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.), an early supporter, said Thursday he wants to see the party unify and is now backing Mrs. Clinton. ""I support her and will do what I can to help ensure her victory,"" he said in a statement.Courting some of Mr. Sanders's voters won't be easy. A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll last month showed that of Sanders voters, two-thirds would back Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump. About 17% of Sanders voters would support Mr. Trump and another 17% were undecided.In advance of Mr. Sanders's speech, some of his hard-line supporters said they hoped to hear him commit to staying in the race and persuade superdelegates to get behind his campaign before the convention next month in Philadelphia.Using Facebook and other social media outlets, the ""Bernie or Bust"" wing of the party is planning to mount protests at the convention and oppose Mrs. Clinton's nomination.""We want him to go all the way,"" said Laurie Cestnick of Boston, who is part of a pro-Sanders movement called Occupy DNC. ""That's a big part of why we're going"" to the convention. ""We believe this has been a very rigged election and very much rigged against him.""John Jackson, a college administrator in Amherst, Mass., is a Sanders supporter who also would like to see him persevere in vying for the nomination. He questioned Mrs. Clinton's honesty and said: ""At this point, I don't have any reason I feel like I could possibly vote for her.""Sanders aides are preparing for the convention. Apart from shaping the party platform, they also want to see the party adopt rules changes aimed at making it easier for people to vote. Mr. Sanders has complained about long lines at polling places and Democratic Party rules that make it tough for people to register and vote in the run-up to the election.He also wants to do away with superdelegates--the hundreds of elected officials and party leaders who have outsize influence on the nomination. Party leaders created the superdelegate system to prevent the nomination of candidates seen as unelectable.

Bernie Sanders to Lay Out His Priorities in Internet Address; Speech will implicitly acknowledge that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic presidential nominee,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797438696?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders isn't ready to endorse Hillary Clinton yet, but he is laying out to his backers a new role that essentially abandons any lingering ambitions to win the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.Mr. Sanders is expected to outline his new priorities Thursday night in an internet address to his followers: Persuading Mrs. Clinton to accept a party platform that carries pieces of his liberal policy goals, including government-run health care, and to adopt changes in how Democrats pick nominees.""His base is looking for signals about where he's going, what he's doing and what he's thinking,"" said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union that has been among Mr. Sanders's most ardent supporters. ""People are looking to Bernie for direction.""Having locked up the nomination, Mrs. Clinton's campaign began putting its imprint on the Democratic National Committee on Thursday, installing Brandon Davis as general election chief of staff. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook visited the DNC headquarters in Washington, D.C., to introduce Mr. Davis, who had been national political director for the Service Employees International Union. The union endorsed Mrs. Clinton last year.Not wanting to antagonize Sanders supporters, the DNC won't immediately recast itself as an arm of the campaign, a Clinton adviser said. Campaign officials are treating Mr. Sanders and his supporters carefully, hoping to win them over and unite the party for the general election fight against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Still, the Vermont senator doesn't have unlimited time to readjust. With each day, his leverage diminishes as the party coalesces behind Mrs. Clinton. The AFL-CIO, a coalition of labor unions that represents 12.5 million members, had been split during the primary; on Thursday, it endorsed the former secretary of state.And there are signs the Sanders coalition is breaking apart. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.), an early supporter, said Thursday he wants to see the party unify and is now backing Mrs. Clinton. ""I support her and will do what I can to help ensure her victory,"" he said in a statement.Courting some of Mr. Sanders' voters won't be easy. A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll last month showed that of Sanders voters, two-thirds would back Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump. About 17% of Sanders voters would support Mr. Trump and another 17% were undecided.In advance of Mr. Sanders's speech, some of his hard-line supporters said they hoped to hear him commit to staying in the race and persuade superdelegates to get behind his campaign before the convention next month in Philadelphia.Using Facebook and other social media outlets, the ""Bernie or Bust"" wing of the party is planning to mount protests at the convention and oppose Mrs. Clinton's nomination.""We want him to go all the way,"" said Laurie Cestnick of Boston, who is part of a pro-Sanders movement called Occupy DNC. ""That's a big part of why we're going"" to the convention. ""We believe this has been a very rigged election and very much rigged against him.""John Jackson, a college administrator in Amherst, Mass., is a Sanders supporter who also would like to see him persevere in vying for the nomination. He questioned Mrs. Clinton's honesty and said: ""At this point, I don't have any reason I feel like I could possibly vote for her.""Sanders aides are preparing for the convention. Apart from shaping the party platform, they also want to see the party adopt rules changes aimed at making it easier for people to vote. Mr. Sanders has complained about long lines at polling places and Democratic Party rules that make it tough for people to register and vote in the run-up to the election.He also wants to do away with superdelegates--the hundreds of elected officials and party leaders who have outsize influence on the nomination. Party leaders created the superdelegate system to prevent the nomination of candidates seen as unelectable. The Sanders campaign argues the system is undemocratic, giving party elites too much power in choosing the nominee.Mr. Sanders also wants the party to oust Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman. Sanders aides have long complained that Ms. Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, favored Mrs. Clinton during the yearlong nomination fight: scheduling debates on weekends and in holiday seasons when viewership is typically low, for example.As an insurgent candidate running against one of the most famous people in the world, Mr. Sanders believed he needed widely-seen debates to introduce himself to voters.Though Ms. Wasserman Schultz remains in the job, her clout is diminishing now that Mrs. Clinton is, for practical purposes, taking over the party.

Bernie Sanders Not Being Vetted as Hillary Clinton's Running Mate; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is among a group of Democratic officials being considered,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796959787?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's campaign isn't considering primary rival Bernie Sanders as her running mate, but is actively looking at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose populist politics line up closely with Mr. Sanders, people familiar with the process said.The vetting remains in its early stages. So far, potential candidates have been scrutinized using publicly available information. The Clinton team hasn't asked anyone to submit tax returns or other personal information, one of the people said. Conversations with Mrs. Clinton herself about options are just now beginning.Beyond the Massachusetts senator, other prospective candidates include Labor Secretary Tom Perez; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Cory Booker of New Jersey; Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and Reps. Xavier Becerra of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio, several Democrats said.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Trump Stands on Guns, Gays Unnerve Would-Be Allies* Polls Suggest Voters Soured on Trump After Attacks on Judge* Senators Negotiate Over Possible Gun Curbs* Clinton Shows Another Side in General-Election PivotAsked Tuesday if she would consider Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton told Telemundo, ""I haven't even begun to sort all that out."" She added, ""There are a lot of really qualified, dynamic candidates, I'm sure, to be considered for vice president.""The search process is being led by John Podesta, the campaign chairman. Longtime Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills also is an informal adviser.Many Sanders supporters, disappointed by his failure to win the nomination, have held out hope that Mrs. Clinton would pick the Vermont senator in a show of unity and a signal that she will chart a progressive course if elected.At a board meeting of Friends of the Earth Action last week that included senior Sanders advisers, several board members said Mr. Sanders should receive serious consideration as Mrs. Clinton's running mate, said Erich Pica, president of the environmental group. Their argument, he said, was that he has brought ideas and energy to the debate.Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser who was there, replied that Mr. Sanders would be a ""powerful voice"" and a major national figure from his Senate perch, Mr. Cohen confirmed.Mr. Sanders isn't particularly interested in the job, nor is he expecting to be offered it, though he doesn't mind being part of the conversation, a senior Sanders adviser said. He sees himself as exercising his strongest influence in the Senate, where his profile is sure to be elevated following his presidential run, the adviser said.The two camps are now in talks about how to unify the Democratic Party, with the Sanders forces pushing for changes in party rules and installing liberal policies in its platform at the July convention in Philadelphia.Mr. Sanders plans a video address to supporters Thursday night, but isn't expected to formally endorse Mrs. Clinton there, an aide said.Mrs. Clinton's top priority is finding someone who is prepared to step in as president, she has said. She also is looking for a working partner who can help advance her agenda, and her advisers are less concerned with demographic and geographic factors, people familiar with the process said.Some Sanders backers are encouraging her to pick someone from the more liberal wing of the party. ""I would certainly encourage consideration of Bernie and other folks who represent the progressive side,"" said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), the only senator to back Mr. Sanders during the primary fight. Mr. Merkley also mentioned Ms. Warren and Mr. Brown.Mrs. Clinton doesn't feel pressured to go that route, since she already embraced such progressive positions as a large increase in the minimum wage and a plan to guarantee debt-free tuition at public universities, a senior strategist said.Clinton officials said they've been impressed by Ms. Warren's sharp critique of Republican Donald Trump, and they've made a point to highlight her endorsement along with those of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.Mr. Brown also appears to be under consideration, although if he were elected, Ohio's Republican governor would appoint his successor, which could impact control of the Senate. One person familiar with the process said this is a factor in considering him, but said every candidate brings some sort of wrinkle.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",6/17/16
Election 2016: Sanders Closes Polling Gap With Clinton --- Tight race weighs on the Democratic front- runner as she tries to pivot to November,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781723664?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders has all but eliminated Hillary Clinton's polling lead among Democratic voters nationwide, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has found, offering signs that she continues to struggle with the primary electorate at a time when she wanted to build strength for the general election.Mr. Sanders for the first time is close to tying Mrs. Clinton, as 48% of Democratic primary voters picked him as their first choice for president, while 50% picked her. In a poll last month, Mrs. Clinton was ahead by 9 percentage points, a 53%-to-44% edge.A majority of states have already held their primary contests, and the Vermont senator's surge in support likely comes too late for him to overcome Mrs. Clinton's big lead in delegates to the summer nominating convention in Philadelphia. But the survey suggests that the long and bitter primary campaign has taken a toll on the former senator and secretary of state.""As she is finishing this primary, she is not gaining strength,"" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. ""The cracks are showing, and she is losing strength.""Mrs. Clinton's saving grace is the weakness of her potential Republican opposition. The survey found that GOP front-runner Donald Trump would have a harder time consolidating his party behind him than she would hers. Some 38% of Republican primary voters said they couldn't see themselves supporting the New York businessman, while 21% of Democrats said they couldn't support Mrs. Clinton.In a hypothetical general election matchup, Mrs. Clinton outpolls Mr. Trump 50% to 39%, the survey found.But for most voters, that would be a lesser-of-two-evils choice: 56% of both Trump and Clinton voters said their vote would be cast because they didn't want the other candidate to win.""For these voters, casting their ballot for president in 2016 is not about an idealistic vision of hope and change or a new day in America,"" Mr. Yang said, ""but, rather, a much more sober and pragmatic feeling as they check the box: It could be worse.""Among Republicans, Mr. Trump has maintained his advantage as the field of candidates dwindled. He is the first choice of 40% of GOP primary voters, compared with 35% for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and 24% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.But the poll could fuel his rivals' argument that Mr. Trump would be the party's weakest candidate against Mrs. Clinton in November: Mr. Cruz trails her by two points, 46% to 44%, in a hypothetical matchup, while Mr. Kasich outpolls her, 51% to 39%.The two parties' front-runners are making history with the negative feelings they inspire. The share of voters who feel negatively toward Mr. Trump, at 65%, or Mrs. Clinton, at 56%, is unprecedented for a major-party nominee. By comparison, President Barack Obama was viewed in a negative light by 43%, and Republican nominee Mitt Romney by 44%, at the end of the 2012 general-election campaign.""America is on the path to electing the most unpopular president since 1948,"" said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who also helped conduct the survey.Measuring the front-runners' qualities of character, the poll found that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump are worse for the wear over the past six months.Voters still rate Mrs. Clinton highly for the knowledge and experience she would bring to the office. But over the past six months, she has lost ground on two crucial qualities: Voters, including those in her own party, are less likely to see her as an agent of change and as honest and straightforward.Just 22% of registered voters give her high marks for being able to bring real change to the country. Even among Democratic primary voters, the share giving her high marks dropped to 41%, down from 57% in October.On being honest and straightforward, just 19% rate her highly. Among Democratic primary voters, those rating her highly dropped to 40%, from 52% in October.Mr. Trump has also lost ground on key points. Voters are less likely to give him high marks on his signature claim: that he can get things done. Some 38% rate him highly on that quality, down from 48% in October. Among Republican voters, 64% rate him highly for effectiveness, down from 72%.While ""telling it like it is"" is Mr. Trump's calling card, fewer voters now see him as honest and straightforward. The share who rated Mr. Trump highly on being honest and straightforward was 35%, down from 43% in October.Asked which party is better equipped to handle foreign policy, voters picked the Democrats by a three-point margin. By a narrow margin, voters also saw the Democratic Party as better able to handle immigration.That could fuel some Republicans' concern that the party's standing would suffer from Mr. Trump's harsh rhetoric about illegal immigration and his support for a reduced role for the U.S. military in world affairs.But Mr. McInturff, the Republican pollster, said he didn't see signs that Mr. Trump was doing any ""damage to the Republican Party that is irreparable.""Mr. Sanders's strong support among primary voters continued a steady narrowing of the gap since January, when Mrs. Clinton led by 25 points, 59% to 34%. In June 2015, a Journal/NBC News poll found Mrs. Clinton leading the Democratic contest by 60 percentage points, 75% to 15%.Credit: By Janet Hook",6/17/16
Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: The Damage Sanders's Clinton Bashing May Do,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781723393?accountid=12768,"As the big New York primary election arrives, it would be a mistake to say the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination is dragging on with no end in sight. Despite tightening poll numbers, it's dragging on with a likely end still in sight: Hillary Clinton prevailing, both in New York and nationwide, because the delegate math works inexorably in her favor.So the question increasingly is this: How much damage is she absorbing at the hands of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the meantime?The answer: The damage is hardly fatal but it is starting to matter, especially in Mrs. Clinton's standing with crucial independent voters. The specific problem isn't merely that Mr. Sanders's tone has turned more harsh in attacking her. The particular problem is that his critique increasingly focuses on declaring she can't be trusted because she takes campaign contributions from big banks and big business. That is a line of attack that seems almost designed to hit Mrs. Clinton in her area of greatest vulnerability, which is voter doubts about her honesty and trustworthiness. The pattern continued Monday when the Sanders campaign accused the Clinton camp of possibly violating campaign-finance laws, prompting Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook to declare that ""the Sanders campaign's false attacks have gotten out of hand.""Of course, this is the stage of a tough election race when it's common for partisans in either party -- or this year, in both parties -- to lament that a bruising primary season is hurting their chances for victory in the general election. And frequently those concerns turn out to be overblown. Certainly, Democrats lamented the length and tone of the long Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton fight in 2008, and that fight turned out to be, if anything, helpful in tuning up Mr. Obama for a big November win.""I think Sanders is hurting Clinton with Republicans -- but they wouldn't have voted for her anyway,"" says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ""With Democrats and independents the effect is minimal. So real impact is marginal at best.""Still, there is impact, as suggested by a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll that showed the share of voters who hold a negative view of Mrs. Clinton continues to grow. Perhaps of most concern to Democrats are the signs of souring views among independent voters. In January, the share of independent voters who had positive views of Mrs. Clinton stood at 35%, while 54% had negative views. In the new survey, just 20% of independents had positive views, while 62% had negative views.There even is evidence of damage among soft Democrats -- that is, people who lean Democratic but aren't core partisans. Among that group, the share holding negative views of Mrs. Clinton grew to 32% this month from 21% in January.Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster, thinks the ""aggressive"" Sanders tone is likely to backfire with Democratic women, who make up 59% of the party's primary voters. But she also worries it is eroding one of the party's key advantages this year.""Originally, I think Sanders played an important role mobilizing voters and articulating an important economic and change message,"" she says. ""I think voters found refreshing the contrast with the Republicans of two candidates engaged in serious conversation about our country's future and offering a real platform. Now, with ridiculous, overstated attacks like Hillary isn't qualified, it makes us look as bad as the Republicans and turns off voters.""The tone problem was on full display at a big Sanders rally in New York City last week, where one speaker, health-care activist Dr. Paul Song, said liberals' goal of achieving Medicare for all won't happen ""if we continue to elect corporate Democratic whores who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry.""He later apologized and said he was referring to Democrats in Congress, not to Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Sanders said the remarks were ""inappropriate."" Still, the tone is the sort of thing that could give moderate Republicans who might otherwise never vote for businessman Donald Trump a reason to think about doing exactly that.It's also rhetoric consistent with Mr. Sanders's broader critique -- she's a captive of special interests who will abandon average folks, on their behalf -- which threatens to exacerbate her biggest problem: In the new Journal/NBC News poll, just 19% gave her good marks for being ""honest and straightforward.""Mrs. Clinton appears to have the upper hand in a general-election matchup against either Mr. Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But in either case, she'll need Sanders voters to show up. And it appears that in a matchup against Mr. Trump, a fair share of her vote would come from people embracing her as the lesser of two evils.The problem with the Sanders attacks is he is close to portraying her as representing a kind of evil in the system, which threatens to erode that particular advantage.Credit: By Gerald F.

Sanders Supporters Seek Ways to Keep 'Bernie' Movement Alive; Election presents choice they had hoped to avoid: Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797778572?accountid=12768,"CHICAGO--Liberal activists behind Bernie Sanders's campaign held a weekend conference to commiserate over his loss to Hillary Clinton and plot ways to keep the ""Bernie"" movement alive now that the candidate is exiting the presidential stage.In their view, the general election presents a painful choice: Mrs. Clinton or presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Dominique Scott, a University of Mississippi student, got a standing ovation at a panel discussion Saturday when she described her predicament as a first-time voter in a presidential race. ""I'm so discouraged about the moment we're in right now,"" Ms. Scott said. ""I am distraught that the two choices that I get are two people who do not represent me and do not represent the things that I need.""While some Sanders supporters are rallying around the presumptive Democratic nominee--including the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor coalition--resistance from his most ardent backers threatens to split the party ahead of the showdown with Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders wasn't at the conference dubbed ""The People's Summit."" But the Vermont senator was everywhere all the same. Millennials walked through the halls wearing T-shirts bearing sketches of his receding hairline. In panels, participants dissected the campaign's rise and fall and talked wistfully about how close Mr. Sanders came to vanquishing Mrs. Clinton. Piped in over loudspeakers was a song capturing the mood: the Beatles' ""Revolution.""The conference's lead organizer was National Nurses United, an ally that dispatched a customized bus to various primary states rallying the Sanders faithful. Among the 3,000 attendees were assorted socialists, union officials, community organizers and college students. Together, they represent the wing of the Sanders coalition that is the least enthused about coalescing behind the Clinton campaign.""It's a terrible place we find ourselves in,"" said Becky Bond, a former adviser to Mr. Sanders's campaign, in a session titled ""Understanding our Movement Moment."" The best a Clinton presidency would produce is a nation ""slightly worse than it is under Obama,"" Ms. Bond said.What worries some at the conference is the fate of Mr. Sanders's email list. They want him to keep it away from the Clinton campaign. Seeing the list as a coveted asset, his supporters want Mr. Sanders to use it to promote like-minded candidates. Clinton aides have other ideas; they want him to use the list to tout her candidacy. Rosario Dawson, an actress who campaigned for Mr. Sanders and attended the conference, said in an interview she has no use for any pro-Clinton messages crossing her cellphone: ""If she wants our vote, then she needs to go get it,"" she said. ""We didn't register to vote and phone bank and canvass for her for a reason.""A theme of the conference is that the movement that propelled Mr. Sanders doesn't need him to endure. The victories he notched in 23 contests demonstrate a public appetite for the liberal solutions he put forward, participants said.A new goal, they said, is finding a fresh crop of candidates who will push for the policy changes Mr. Sanders championed, including a government-run health-care system and free tuition at public colleges.Mr. Sanders shares that aim. In his online address on Thursday, he urged his supporters to run for elective office and reverse a tide of Republican victories at the state and local level. His campaign said that within 24 hours of the speech, nearly 7,000 people signed up on his website to get more information.The conference attendees see the Democratic Party as an obstacle to the sort of candidate recruitment they believe is necessary. Many would like to have a new party emerge, believing the current leadership incapable of closing the gap between rich and poor.Mr. Sanders, too, wants changes in the way the party does business and has called for the ouster of the chairwoman, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Nina Turner, a Sanders supporter and former Ohio state senator, said that even though she has been a lifelong Democrat, ""a third party might not be bad for this country.""""Let's shake it up,"" Ms. Turner said. ""I want to see the Democratic Party live up to our values.""As for the question on everyone's mind--what to do in the general election--one speaker offered a piece of advice. Work for a Clinton victory if you must, but never stop pushing for sweeping policy changes, said Tobita Chow, chairman of a Chicago-based political group called ""The People's Lobby.""""If you're going to spend the next five months volunteering for the Clinton campaign and phone-banking for her, you're not building anything. You're not building this movement. That's five months of wasted time,"" Mr. Chow said.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",6/20/16
Bernie Sanders Makes a Last Push: to Change Party Rules; Democratic candidate's plan could help an insurgent in the 2020 presidential campaign,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797606899?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders is winding down his presidential run by pushing for changes to Democratic Party rules that could assist an insurgent campaign like his own in the next presidential election.The Vermont lawmaker is eager to influence the party's platform, which will be approved at the Democratic National Convention next month in Philadelphia. He is pushing for free tuition at public colleges, a $15 federal minimum wage, a carbon tax and other positions where he and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton disagree.But the Sanders campaign also wants the party to adopt a range of changes to how it governs itself. While party platforms are typically forgotten soon after they are approved, the party rules will affect how the next presidential contest is run.""We need major, major changes in the Democratic Party in converting it to a party of the people,"" Mr. Sanders said this week. ""We need an electoral process which is worthy of the Democrats.""Specifically, he wants to get rid of superdelegates, the party leaders and elected officials who get to vote for whomever they like for the party's nomination. He wants all presidential primaries to be open to independent voters, and not just to registered Democrats, and for the party to encourage candidates to reject support in primaries from super PACs, the outside political groups that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money.Those issues are fodder for talks under way with the Clinton campaign. For now, Mr. Sanders remains an ""active candidate"" for the nomination, said his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, Friday on MSNBC.Clinton aides suggest the two campaigns will overcome their differences. For instance, while Mr. Sanders backs a $15 federal minimum wage and Mrs. Clinton backs a $12 level, they both want to see an increase from the current $7.25. There may be language both candidates can agree to.The rules changes are more complicated. Rules governing primaries, for instance, are set by states. The national party could encourage changes by awarding extra delegates to states that make the requested changes. All of this will likely be turned over to a post-convention commission.Other changes are complicated by the egos and preferences of hundreds of party leaders. That is particularly true of superdelegates, a role created to make sure party leaders had some control over the presidential nomination.The superdelegates have never taken the nomination away from someone who won in the primaries and caucuses, but the Sanders forces believe they exercise an undue influence nonetheless. Before any votes were cast, Mrs. Clinton had a large delegate lead thanks to her support among superdelegates, and Mr. Sanders and his supporters say this gave her an air of inevitability.In the end, Mrs. Clinton beat him by nearly 400 pledged delegates, the type chosen by the voters. Among the 713 superdelegates, she has 581, with 49 for Mr. Sanders, according to an Associated Press tally.Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser who is a superdelegate himself, said one possibility is to give these elected officials and party leaders floor passes to the convention but not allow them to vote on the nomination. That would allow them to participate without having to run for one of their state's delegate spots.But others say the superdelegates play an important role in bringing professional political experience into the mix. ""They allow influence and input from people involved with the party for a long time without letting them make the ultimate decision,"" said Brady Quirk-Garvan, chairman of the Charleston County, S.C., Democratic Party who will be a regular delegate to the convention, backing Mrs. Clinton.The issue will be hashed out in the Rules Committee, which will be co-chaired by former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a vocal Clinton backer. Because of that allegiance, Mr. Sanders has called on him to step down.Mr. Frank has declined to step down, but said in a recent interview that he is open to changes in the superdelegate role as a way of making the process more democratic. ""There should be some diminution of their role,"" he said. He added that he would also like to see the party discourage caucuses, which are harder to participate in than primaries.Mr. Sanders typically did better in caucuses, and some of his advisers have defended them as important party-building exercises.Mr. Frank described superdelegates and caucuses as the two areas ""where we fall short of the democratic ideal.""Julian Routh contributed to this article.Credit: By Laura Meckler",6/20/16
Bern Out; Sanders finally surrenders (informally) to the inevitable.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797580066?accountid=12768,"(Best of the Tube this weekend: Catch us on ""The Journal Editorial Report"" discussing terrorism and the Orlando attack. Fox News Channel--note new time, 3:30 p.m. ET both Saturday and Sunday.) Bye-ku for Bernie SandersThe Bertha movement Million as and billion as It's all a gockyWe thought long and hard--well, OK, neither long nor hard, but we gave the matter some thought--about whether to roll out the Bernie Sanders haiku today. He hasn't formally suspended his campaign, and he said in a speech to supporters last night that ""we must take that energy""--not fossil fuels, thank you very much--""into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates.""More than 1,900 implies fewer than 2,000, and to paraphrase an apocryphal quote from the first Democratic president, one man with courage makes a majority, but only if he has 2,382 delegates. Hillary Clinton does. Sanders insisted that his ""political revolution"" will ""continue into the future,"" but his speech amounted to a concession that unless Mrs. Clinton gets arrested (a real possibility with a meager probability), he will not be the Democratic Party's 2016 nomination for president.Sanders made use of analepsis in reminiscing about the campaign's achievements (""Together . . .""), recapitulating its purpose (""It is about . . ."") and exhorting the Democratic Party to remake itself in accordance with his ideological preferences (""We must . . ."").Sanders has been elected to office 14 times, not once as a Democrat. So what does he mean by ""we""? He answered that question in one of the two noteworthy passages of the speech, the introduction to the ""We must . . ."" section:I . . . look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to transform the Democratic Party so that it becomes a party of working people and young people, and not just wealthy campaign contributors: a party that has the courage to take on Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry, the fossil fuel industry and the other powerful special interests that dominate our political and economic life.According to Matthew Yglesias , fashion editor of the young-adult site Vox, that ""really enrages Democratic leaders"":It's incredibly frustrating for people who've been working in mainstream Democratic Party politics to hear their party described as something other than a party for ""working people."" . . .It's one thing to disagree with people about policy substance or political tactics. But something Sanders has done throughout his campaign and very pointedly did here is straightforwardly challenge the good faith of the vast majority of his colleagues in Democratic Party politics. It's worked pretty well for him on the stump, but it doesn't win you a lot of friends. And to be honest, it's simply wrong.You're only supposed to challenge the good faith of people in the other party. And that Sanders did, in the other noteworthy passage of his speech:This campaign is about defeating Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for president. After centuries of racism, sexism and discrimination of all forms in our country we do not need a major party candidate who makes bigotry the cornerstone of his campaign. We cannot have a president who insults Mexicans and Latinos, Muslims, women and African-Americans. We cannot have a president who, in the midst of so much income and wealth inequality, wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the very rich. We cannot have a president who, despite all of the scientific evidence, believes that climate change is a hoax.The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly.On that last point Sanders is slightly less radical than George Will , who in April hoped for a 50-state Democratic landslide should Trump become the nominee.In some ways, though, Sanders is an unlikely Nevertrump tribune. Sanders and Trump have more in common than one suspects Sanders would like to admit: Trump's history with the Republicans is about as longstanding and deep as Sanders's with the Democrats. Trump has led something of a political revolution as well--and more successfully than Sanders, in part perhaps because he is more talented politically, but also because the Republican establishment proved brittler than the Democratic one.Also like Sanders, Trump seeks to remake the GOP into a ""party of working people."" In a statement yesterday after the AFL-CIO endorsed the inevitable Democratic nominee, Trump declared: ""Hillary Clinton is the enemy of working people and is the best friend Wall Street ever had."" Sanders couldn't have said it better, or at least didn't.The obvious question arises: How effective will Sanders be at campaigning against Trump when that means urging his starry-eyed supporters to cast ballots for as unappealing a candidate as Mrs. Clinton?A Bloomberg poll released this week finds Mrs. Clinton picking up a majority of Sanders backers--but not a large majority: ""She receives 55 percent from Sanders supporters, while Trump gets 22 percent and [Libertarian Gary] Johnson gets 18 percent."" And this was not a Trump-friendly survey: Overall, Mrs. Clinton led him 49% to 37%, with 9% for Johnson.""The Republican National Committee is promoting a report that accuses the Democratic Party of conspiring to nominate Hillary Clinton in the early days of the presidential primary,"" the Hill reports:In an email, the RNC sent to reporters a story published by the New York Post about a document that purportedly shows the Democratic National Committee was strategizing to make Hillary Clinton president--and not a generic Democratic candidate--in the spring of 2015. . . .The story is based on a document posted on the blog of a user named ""Guccifer 2.0,"" and appears to be part of a trove of documents stolen from the DNC by Russian government hackers. . . .It's unclear whether the document that the hacker claims is from the DNC is a real one. . . .The RNC sent out the article in an email blast to reporters, highlighting a point in the report that the memo ""appears to show the DNC working on behalf of Hillary Clinton from the start of the presidential campaign--just as Bernie Sanders has claimed.""Ironically (assuming the report is genuine), the effort might have ended up helping Sanders. If the Clinton camp and the DNC bigfooted serious potential rivals into forgoing the race, they wouldn't have bothered with the crazy old socialist independent from Vermont. Since nobody else of note ended up running, he became the alternative by default.But then again, here's another counterfactual: What if several serious candidates had challenged Mrs. Clinton for the nomination, preventing her from ever gaining a clear lead? It's possible enough primary voters would have been drawn to Sanders, the nongeneric Democrat, to make him the leader. That's more or less how Trump engineered his political revolution.Metaphor Alert ""America saw Barack Obama at low tide yesterday, revealed as brimming with fury and bankrupt of ideas and even sympathy for the dead.""--Michael Goodwin, New York Post, June 15We Blame George W.

Bernie Sees Panama Red,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780086655?accountid=12768,"When you're a protectionist hammer, everything looks like a free-trade agreement to pound. So it shouldn't surprise that Bernie Sanders is using the disclosures in the Panama Papers to assail the 2011 U.S.-Panama trade accord for making secret bank accounts possible. As usual, the Vermont socialist has it backward.""What the Panamanian free-trade agreement did is enable large corporations and the wealthiest people -- not just in this country but around the world -- to participate in massive tax-avoidance schemes,"" Mr. Sanders said in Philadelphia Thursday.But there is no evidence to support his claim, and the opposite seems to be true. U.S. tax law requires confidentiality regarding requests that the U.S. might make of foreign governments. But what we do know is that U.S. negotiators made the signing of a separate bilateral tax agreement with Panama a condition for signing the larger trade deal. It was ratified by Panama ahead of the trade deal.This tax accord is known as a tax information exchange agreement, and it essentially obliges the two governments to share tax information, a practice that helps track down tax evaders. As the Obama Treasury puts it, these agreements ""increase transparency between the U.S. and financial centers around the world.""By the way, U.S. goods exports to Panama increased from 2012-2014, though last year they fell below the 2011 total in part due to a slowdown in Panama's economy. The deal also gives U.S. businesses access to Panama's $20.6 billion market in services. All of which is to say that the Panama free-trade deal is a net benefit for the U.S. even if it doesn't fit Bernie's political narrative.",6/21/16
Election 2016: Sanders Leaves Trail for Vatican --- Democrat lectures on inequality instead of chasing primary votes; no meeting with pope,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781304773?accountid=12768,"VATICAN CITY -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders took an unusual break from the campaign trail Friday to lecture about Catholic teaching on economic justice -- more than 4,000 miles away from a New York primary that he needs to win on Tuesday.After an overnight flight following his contentious debate with Hillary Clinton in Brooklyn, N.Y., Mr. Sanders addressed an academic conference at the Vatican. His voice hoarse yet forceful, the Vermont senator touched on familiar topics in his campaign, including income inequality and his calls for a campaign-finance overhaul.He also quoted some of Pope Francis' severe criticisms of capitalism, including his denunciations of a ""cult of money"" and a ""globalization of indifference"" to the needy.Mr. Sanders's decision to leave the campaign trail days before the primary was a bit of a gamble. Although the trip received widespread press coverage, he relinquished a full day of campaigning in a state where he trails Mrs. Clinton by double digits, polls show. New York is one of the best chances left for Mr. Sanders to cut into his opponent's lead of 250 pledged delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination.Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist not aligned with either candidate, said in an interview: ""He's going to perhaps lose a little bit of momentum in New York and come back very tired going into the home stretch. I don't see the political benefit they [the Sanders campaign] apparently see.""Mr. Sanders suggested the invitation was simply an opportunity he couldn't resist. He long has said he admires Pope Francis' critiques of unfettered markets and obsession with money.During a discussion with other conference participants, Mr. Sanders said he didn't ""choose to politicize the pope,"" but was a ""fan of the pope's clarity, his humility, his vision and his courage"" in addressing urgent problems ranging from youth unemployment to climate change.Meeting separately with reporters, Mr. Sanders said he was unfazed by any political risks. ""I know it's taking me away from the campaign trail for a day, but . . . it was so moving to me that it was something that I could just simply not refuse to attend,"" he said.In his short stayat the Vatican, it appeared he wouldn't cross paths with Pope Francis. Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, chancellor of the Vatican body sponsoring the event, read a message from the pope that said he had planned to visit the conference site and greet the participants.But Pope Francis added in his note that he couldn't make it because of preparations for his Saturday visit to the Greek island of Lesbos, where he is scheduled to meet asylum seekers and address the European migration crisis.That announcement seemed to resolve the major question hanging over Mr. Sanders's trip: whether his visit to Rome, scheduled to last less than 24 hours, would yield at least a brief moment with the pope.It would have been highly unusual for the pope to meet a presidential candidate such as Mr. Sanders, even for a photographed handshake, since the Vatican ordinarily avoids even the appearance of involvement in the electoral politics of foreign countries.Pope Francis' remark in February that Donald Trump's tough stands on immigration mean that the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination was ""not Christian"" was a notable departure from that policy.Mr. Sanders's speech was part of an academic conference dedicated to the 25th anniversary of an encyclical by St. John Paul II, ""Centesimus Annus,"" which is best known for its qualified praise of free-market economics.Yet the conference was notable for the participation of two prominent critics of globalization, the populist presidents of Ecuador and Bolivia, Rafael Correa and Evo Morales. Mr. Correa, who spoke shortly before Mr. Sanders Friday afternoon, spoke of the need to restrain the ""excesses of savage capitalism.""Mr. Sanders's indictments of economic inequities were welcomed by other participants. During the discussion session, he reiterated his calls for improving inner-city schools and making public colleges tuition-free, and stressed the need to protect individual privacy from surveillance by governments and corporations, even while fighting terrorism. ""I think in my country there is a lot of fear about the future,"" he said. ""Politicians play on that fear.""Credit: By Francis X. Rocca and Peter Nicholas",6/22/16
Election 2016: Candidates Court New York Jews --- Republican rivals head to Brooklyn; Sanders is on defensive after remarks about Israel,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781293025?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- It was a sight that even those anticipating a competitive New York presidential primary on Tuesday hadn't expected to witness: Republican candidate Ted Cruz in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn belting out ""Dayenu,"" the Passover Seder song.With New York's many delegates in play this year, candidates from both parties have sought to court Jewish voters, a population known for its high turnout. New York contains the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside Israel.""It's part and parcel of New York being in play -- when was the last time you saw a presidential primary candidate in Brooklyn baking matzos?"" said Ester Fuchs, a professor of political science at Columbia University. ""I can't remember in a primary, in my voting lifetime, seeing this.""In the past week, both Mr. Cruz and GOP rival Ohio Gov. John Kasich have made pilgrimages to Brooklyn matzo bakeries. The Texas senator graces the cover of the current issue of Ami Magazine, a publication that caters to the Orthodox Jewish community.The Cruz campaign's outreach to New York Jews ""has been very systematic and very well-concentrated and very targeted over the last year,"" said Michael Fragin, a New York-based Republican political operative whose work focuses on the Jewish community. He is unaffiliated with any campaign.On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's campaign has had a helping hand from Avi Fink, an Orthodox Jewish senior political aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has taken a leave of absence from City Hall to assist the front-runner.On Tuesday, a group of 12 Jewish New York City Council members announced their support for Mrs. Clinton, saying ""she helped build an international coalition to put in place the toughest sanctions in Iran's history, and at every turn, she has been a steadfast supporter of Israel's right to defend itself against Jihadist threats.""Her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has encountered a backlash over his comments to the New York Daily News editorial board in which he overstated the number of Palestinians killed in the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, as well as his absence at this year's American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference.His campaign suffered another setback this week after it suspended his national Jewish outreach coordinator, Simone Zimmerman, over social media posts containing derogatory references to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mrs. Clinton.And during a Brooklyn debate on Thursday, Mr. Sanders broke from the language that most major Democratic and Republican candidates use on the campaign trail when he questioned the actions of the Israeli government and expressed his sympathy for Palestinians. ""I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people,"" he said. ""That does not make me anti-Israel.""Among likely Jewish Democratic primary voters in New York, Mrs. Clinton holds a wide lead over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist College poll released Thursday. Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Sanders by 65% to 32%, the poll found. Jewish voters, who are predominantly Democrats, constituted about 16% of the likely Democratic primary voter sample.Mr. Sanders has also raised eyebrows for what some in the community perceive as his failure to publicly embrace his Jewish identity. Some of his supporters, however, say such criticism is hypocritical.""I think it's unfair, in some ways, that this is the way he's being cast,"" said Daniel Sieradski, founder of the PAC Jews for Bernie. ""The vast majority of American Jews are secular.""David Greenfield, an Orthodox New York City councilman who is one of those backing Mrs. Clinton, said he believes Mr. Sanders's religion has worked against him in the Jewish community. ""I think identity politics only matter if the person shares your values and beliefs as well, and I think in this case he doesn't share them, especially in the case of supporting Israel,"" Mr. Greenfield said.GOP front-runner Donald Trump on Thursday met privately with representatives of Jewish media outlets for interviews in his office in Midtown. Unlike his GOP rivals, he hasn't been campaigning in heavily Jewish neighborhoods, though many political operatives believe his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who helped write Mr. Trump's AIPAC speech, has been doing outreach there.Credit: By Erica Orden",6/22/16
"Politics & Ideas: After Hillary Beats Bernie, She'll Need Him",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780441025?accountid=12768,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, and there is nothing that Sen. Bernie Sanders can do about it.The Vermont senator's campaign is reportedly planning an all-out assault on the democratic legitimacy of the party's 712 superdelegates, who make up about 15% of the total. But on what basis? As of today, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders by 250 among delegates won in primaries and caucuses. She has received 2.4 million more popular votes than he has. A recent synthesis of exit polls shows that of 27 demographic categories, Mr. Sanders has the edge in three. Despite his recent winning streak, she has prevailed in more states, and his string of victories has narrowed her edge by only 79 delegates.That's the good news for Mr. Sanders, and it is about to end. Between now and the end of April, Democrats will hold primaries in six states -- New York, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Unless a late Sanders surge reverses Mrs. Clinton's lead, she will win the majority -- perhaps all -- of these states, and her lead among delegates and in the popular vote will expand significantly. By the end of April, she will have upward of 90% of the delegates she needs to claim the nomination.The pace of the campaign slows significantly in May, with fewer than 200 delegates at stake. Unless Mr. Sanders wipes her out on June 7 in California and New Jersey -- and there is no evidence that he will -- she will end the nominating contest with more than enough delegates to claim victory, including a majority of delegates earned in primaries and caucuses as well as a margin of millions in the popular vote.So how exactly will the Sanders forces make the case that Mrs. Clinton's nomination would violate the people's will?Recently, Mr. Sanders has been arguing that he would make a stronger general-election candidate, and he has a fair amount of survey evidence to back his claim. But using this argument to sway the superdelegates would be an appeal to their judgment, not to democratic legitimacy.Besides, it won't work. Democrats who have been around the track a few times understand that while Mrs. Clinton has been subjected to unrelenting scrutiny for a quarter of a century, Mr. Sanders's record has been left virtually untouched. The Clinton campaign has been reluctant to antagonize voters whose support they will need in the general election, and Republicans are holding their fire in the vain hope that they will have the opportunity to run against Mr. Sanders in the fall.The real question is how well Mrs. Clinton will do in November. The answer depends on a few things she can control and many more that she cannot. She can try -- within limits -- to placate Mr. Sanders's backers at the nominating convention. She could decide to choose a populist-tinged figure -- Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, for example -- as her running mate. If the Democrats emerge from their convention unified and energized, Mrs. Clinton's fall prospects will rise -- all the more so if Mr. Sanders campaigns vigorously on her behalf.Because every presidential election comes down to a choice, the identity of the Republican nominee will make a big difference. Although Donald Trump is the ultimate wild card, there is no evidence that he would prevail in a general election. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is focused, strategic and well-organized, but his hard-edge conservatism would make it difficult for him to expand his support beyond his party's base. Ohio Gov. John Kasich runs well ahead of Mrs. Clinton in national surveys, but rank-and-file Republicans appear in no mood to nominate someone from their party's moderate-conservative wing.Mrs. Clinton is not a visionary, and her candidacy has done little to inspire Democrats not already committed to her. She is cautious and self-controlled, not a risk-taker. By her own admission, she is not a natural politician. Contradicting Mario Cuomo's famous maxim, she campaigns in prose.On the other hand, few have ever questioned her intelligence or work ethic. She understands how politics and policy-making really work. She believes that political leaders should under-promise and over-perform -- an eminently defensible thesis in this era of rock-bottom public trust.In most democracies, the head of government is separate from the head of state. In the U.S., they are fused in a single office. Our presidents are called on to perform both as prime ministers and as symbols of the nation. Rarely are they equally skilled at both tasks.Hillary Clinton has the qualities of a first-rate prime minister. At a time when the American people are yearning for an end to political dysfunction and a return to government that works effectively on their behalf, what she offers will probably be enough to prevail in November.Credit: By William A.

Bernie Sanders Won't Endorse Hillary Clinton for Now; Democratic presidential challenger wants to hear what the presumptive nominee has to say on a number of issues,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799289446?accountid=12768,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday that he would vote for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November, but declined to endorse her for now, saying he is waiting until she says what he wants to hear on a number of issues.Mr. Sanders's back-to-back television interviews underscored the position he and Mrs. Clinton are in as they negotiate about the Democratic Party's platform. She wants him to get behind her campaign and help move his supporters to her corner. He wants her to move closer to his positions in areas where they have disagreed.For now, Mr. Sanders is struggling with how to answer questions about his intentions. On MSNBC, Mr. Sanders was asked directly if he would vote for Mrs. Clinton this fall. ""Yes,"" he said. He added that he would do ""everything I can to defeat Donald Trump,"" saying that he would be a disaster in ""so many ways"" if he were elected.Afterwards, when asked by email if Mr. Sanders's comment amounted to an endorsement, a spokesman replied, ""No."" And in a separate interview on CBS on Friday, Mr. Sanders made clear he wasn't endorsing her now.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Sen.

Asked if he would be prepared to endorse her before next month's Democratic National Convention, he added, ""I would hope that that would happen, or it may not happen.""The Clinton campaign didn't return a request for comment.Democratic strategists said Mr. Sanders's refusal to endorse his party's presumptive nominee could weaken his credibility going forward, while having little effect on Mrs. Clinton.""It's going to hurt him more than it hurts her,"" said Democratic strategist Mark Mellman. Mr. Sanders's comments make him sound ""churlish,"" he said. ""Closing out that way lowers the esteem in which people hold him and lowers the influence he's going to have in the Senate.""Mr. Mellman said the senator's refusal to endorse Mrs. Clinton was unlikely to have a major effect on the former secretary of state, saying Sanders backers would vote for the nominee over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. ""Bernie's supporters, as much or more than Hillary's supporters, detest Donald Trump, and they're not going to have it on their conscience that they helped elect him,"" he said.When asked Friday if his refusal to withdraw from the race is leading to disunity in the party, Mr. Sanders said that wasn't his top concern.""You talk about disunity, I talk about involving the American people in the political process and wanting to have a government and a party that represents all of us,"" he said.Bill Burton, a Democratic strategist and former aide to President Barack Obama, said Mr. Sanders withholding his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton won't be a factor for long. ""Sanders still has an opportunity to get media attention; but not long after the convention, the number of phone calls he gets from reporters and cable bookers will rapidly decline ... to the point of this issue being irrelevant in not too long,"" he said.Added strategist Steve Elmendorf: ""I think we know where he's going to end up.""Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Julian Routh and Laura Meckler",6/25/16
Sanders Still Hesitates to Endorse Clinton; Vermont Senator wants former secretary of state to fully embrace many of his proposals first,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799444299?accountid=12768,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders declined again to give Hillary Clinton his clear backing for president Sunday, saying the former secretary of state needs to fully embrace many of his proposals first, such as a $15 an hour minimum wage, free college tuition and a single-payer health-care system.Mr. Sanders' presidential campaign has been in talks with the Clinton campaign looking to iron out a way for the two Democratic rivals to come together. Speaking on CNN's State of the Union, Mr. Sanders said the initiative had to come from the Clinton side. A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll last month found that about a third of Sanders' primary voters weren't backing Mrs. Clinton.""What we are doing is trying to say to the Clinton camp: 'Stand up, be bolder than you have been and then many of those voters in fact may come on board,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Those people voted for me, I believe, because they said it is time to have a president who has the guts to stand up to big money interests.""Mr. Sanders said he also wanted to see Mrs. Clinton aggressively push for a carbon tax, the end of fracking and new investments in infrastructure.Now that the Democratic primary process is done, the Sanders campaign is trying to push the party's platform to the left before Democrats hold their presidential convention next month in Philadelphia.A statement from the Sanders campaign Sunday criticized a party committee drafting the platform for voting down language opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal opposed by both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Clinton as well, as language calling for a $15 an hour minimum wage and for stronger environmental rules.In his CNN interview, Mr. Sanders made clear he was waiting for the party and for Mrs. Clinton to more fully adopt his policies before giving her his unquestioning support. Mr. Sanders has said he would likely vote for Mrs. Clinton in November, however.""We are trying to say to Sec. Clinton and to the Clinton campaign: make it clear which side you are on,"" Mr. Sanders said.One main objective, Mr. Sanders said, was to prevent Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, from winning the presidency in November.""To have a candidate for president going around insulting Mexicans and Latinos and Muslims and women and African-Americans, that is not the candidate that the American people are going to support in November,"" he said. ""I am going to do everything that I can do to defeat Donald Trump, but a lot of that responsibility about winning the American people over to her side is going to rest with Sec.

Election 2016: Four Questions for Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785452775?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders isn't quitting the race, but his advisers are hinting that the nomination fight is effectively over. Coming off a series of losses, they acknowledge that Mr. Sanders can't erase Hillary Clinton's lead in pledged delegates in the 14 contests that remain.What that means is that the only way for Mr. Sanders to win is to persuade hundreds of Democratic insiders known as superdelegates to abandon Mrs. Clinton and line up behind the candidate who has criticized the party establishment on and off for decades.As the race reaches the endgame, a few questions arise about a Sanders campaign that exceeded expectations but is on a path to fall short.1. Why did Mr. Sanders take the Clinton email issue off the table?The Vermont senator boxed himself in when he told Mrs. Clinton at the first debate in October that Americans were ""sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.""Mrs. Clinton exclusively used a private account and server duringher tenure as secretary of state. In relying onthatsystem, she ran the risk of exposing sensitive classified material and she complicated public-records requests.In February, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled that top aides to Mrs. Clinton could be questioned under oath about whether they deliberately skirted public-records laws by making use of the private email system. ""This case is about the public's right to know,"" the judge said.Mr. Sanders has questioned Mrs. Clinton's judgment and integrity when it comes to other matters. He faulted her for taking money from Wall Street, including large speaking fees. If he sees the Wall Street speeches as fair game, why put the email controversy off limits?2. Why did he wait so long to build ties to African-American voters?If Mrs. Clinton clinches the Democratic nomination, a key reason is theAfrican-American vote. She built her delegate lead on the loyalty of black voters.Mr. Sanders comes from a state with few black voters and seems to have done little in his political career to forge the sorts of relationships in the black community that would prove valuable in a presidential race.That project needed to begin years ago -- not in the heat of a race against Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders has spent the past few months scrambling to make the case to African-American voters that he would be a reliable ally in the White House. It hasn't helped. Exit polls show he has gotten crushed by Mrs. Clinton among black voters. Mr. Sanders made some of his most aggressive moves to court black voters during the New York primary fight; Mrs. Clinton won NewYork and beat him among black voters by 50 points.3. Why did he wait so long to build ties to Democrats?Mr. Sanders spent decades as an independent. Not until he entered the presidential race last year did he declare himself a Democrat.That is an unconventional path for someone who wants to lead the party. And Mr. Sanders is now paying a price. Superdelegates are party leaders and past and present elected officials who get an outsize say in picking the Democratic nominee. They are backing Mrs. Clinton by 520 to 39, according to an Associated Press tally.As a lawmaker Mr. Sanders has consistently voted with the Democrats and has supported Democratic candidates running for office. But he has never been a creature of the party.""Party politics has not been central to our lives, that's true,"" Jane Sanders, the candidate's wife, said in an interview.What seems clear is Mr. Sanders never thought he would be in this position: running a competitive race against the Clinton juggernaut. Had he foreseen where his political career was headed, he might have been helped by joining the Democrats sooner.4. Why did he write off the South?The Sanders campaign made an early strategic decision that haunts the candidateto this day. Rather than focus on winning delegates in the early going, Mr. Sanders sought to capture some marquee states and demonstrate Mrs. Clinton was beatable.Trouble is, delegates determine the winner -- not states. Sanders aides acknowledge they put up little fight in a slew of Southern states with large black populations. So, Mrs. Clinton won landslide victories in Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Louisiana and elsewhere.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",6/27/16
Bernie Sanders's Legacy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782389072?accountid=12768,"With Hillary Clinton and the party machinery back on track to a now-tarnished coronation, it's worth assessing what Bernie Sanders's campaign accomplished. I still can't take the Vermont Socialist himself seriously, not with Larry David as his doppelganger. But the Sanders phenomenon -- embraced by a strong majority of liberals between the ages of 17 and 50 -- deserves attention.Reporters have exhaustively plumbed the habitats and mental states of ""the Trump voter."" Sen. Sanders's supporters, by contrast, have floated through the primaries in a mist of keywords -- millennials, college students, young professionals, actresses, ""white people.""One has to ask: Are they all actually socialists? I doubt it.It's no surprise Donald Trump in his New York victory speech about the ""corrupt"" Republican Party called Sen. Sanders a fellow ""outsider."" The two great disrupters are remarkably similar, a kind of Tweedledon and Tweedleburn on trade and a ""system"" that's ""broken"" and ""failing"" their supporters.If one word attaches to the Sanders camp, it is ""change."" But change what?This isn't meant to deride their desire for change, which is undoubtedly authentic, but only to ask how it's possible that so many under-50 liberals have settled on Bernie Sanders as a change agent after living daily through more than 87 straight months of a Democratic president elected on a platform of ""Hope and Change""?As to Mrs. Clinton, President Obama's presumed heir, The Wall Street Journal poll this week finds ""just 22% of registered voters give her high marks for being able to bring real change to the country.""What, exactly, is Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or even Bernie Sanders supposed to deliver that an infinity of politicians and public officials before them haven't already delivered?If change has any concrete meaning for Sen. Sanders's supporters, it must have something to do with what the government or public sector does.However imperfect, the federal budget embodies what the U.S. government is.First the numbers. The 2015 federal budget spent about $3.8 trillion, or 21% of the U.S. economy. Year in and year out, that $3 trillion to $4 trillion underwrites programs.As listed at federalsafetynet.com, the programs delivering welfare include: the negative income tax, SNAP (supplemental nutrition), housing assistance, SSI, Pell Grants, TANF (temporary assistance for needy families), child nutrition, Head Start, job training programs, WIC (food for women and children), child care and Liheap (energy subsidies).Entitlement programs include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and the Affordable Care Act.Education: A website called CollegeScholarships.org lists ""Grants from the U.S. Government: Free Money from Uncle Sam.""Why are 25-year-old liberals crying out for ""change,"" if you are spending $4 trillion every year on all this stuff? There's hardly anything significant left to deliver, other than results, so maybe something is wrong with the delivery system.Let's get local. Anyone want to guess what this year's budget is for New York City's hapless school system? It is $27.6 billion.Writing in the Los Angeles Daily News a few years ago, Tim Rutten tried to discern a total-spending figure for the Los Angeles Unified School District. Answer: No one knows. It's too big and too complicated: ""In all, LAUSD receives money earmarked to aid more than 140 categories of students.""This week, the New York Times described the split over Bill and Hillary Clinton between older blacks, who support them, and younger blacks who don't. Said one new-generation activist from Philadelphia: ""We do not believe that freedom for black Americans will come through politicians.""The War on Poverty began in 1965. A half-century later, after uncountable trillions spent, you've still got Baltimore, Chicago, East Brooklyn and East St. Louis. Who wouldn't be angry about black lives?A $15 minimum wage isn't change. It's a fly on the elephant's back.That sound welling out of Sanders rallies is, in no small part, a cri de coeur for accountability. Bernie, a skilled pol, reprogrammed the anger against ""corporate greed,"" but at least you can show up at a shareholders meeting to gripe. With the public sector, it is impossible to identify who they are, other than ""Washington.""At least some of Sen. Sanders's agitated supporters may be starting to recognize that after all these years, the federal government has achieved a steady state of sludge. Hillary Clinton sounds like the most knowledgeable technocrat in America, and none of these young people want much of anything to do with her.Sen. Sanders said he was leading a political revolution. But he won't be its vessel, nor will Mrs. Clinton. It will take someone who can recognize that social change isn't going to happen until you disaggregate these public blobs. And in the private sector, let young companies have enough capital to breathe.Anyone inside Bernie Sanders's neo-socialist orbit suggesting that less blob and more capital might work better runs the risk of being called a ""conservative.""So figure out how to rebrand conservatism, liberalism, progressivism and even socialism as something more like them. Maybe they could call it artisanalism.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Change Didn't Sustain Hope"" -- WSJ May. 3, 2016)Credit: By Daniel Henninger",6/27/16
Election 2016: Sanders's Task: Win Black Votes --- Lack of support in key group threatens to sink Democrat's bid; when will feuds end?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782388973?accountid=12768,"Coming off a lopsided loss in New York, Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign team pointed to an enduring problem that could sink his struggling presidential bid if not fixed: His failure to win over more African-American voters.Black voters in New York on Tuesday were nearly a quarter of the Democratic electorate and favored Hillary Clinton by a 50-point margin, exit polls showed, locking in a victory that gives her a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates.""I am hopeful going forward we will do better,"" said Tad Devine, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Sanders. ""And we know we must. We're not going to win New Jersey unless we improve our numbers with African-American voters.""Meanwhile, some Democrats worry the increasingly harsh tone of the campaign could make it tougher to unify the party for the general election, but it isn't clear the feuding will end anytime soon.During the course of his campaign, Mr. Sanders has tried to make inroads with African-Americans, showcasing endorsements from black celebrities, intellectuals and civil-rights activists. But the outreach isn't paying dividends at the polls.If the trend persists, Mr. Sanders could see his hopes of a comeback extinguished. Aside from California and Pennsylvania, the two states that offer the most delegates through the rest of the calendar are Maryland and New Jersey. In the 2008 Democratic primary, blacks accounted for 23% of Democratic voters in New Jersey, 37% in Maryland.The Sanders campaign is trying again to reach out to black voters. On Wednesday, it released two new TV ads that will air in Maryland targeting black voters. One spot features African-American actor Danny Glover vouching for Mr. Sanders's commitment to civil rights. ""I think Bernie is with us,"" Mr. Glover says.The day after the New York primary was fairly quiet. Mr. Sanders went home to Burlington, Vt. Mrs. Clinton held a forum about gun violence in Philadelphia that featured former Attorney General Eric Holder and several African-American women who have lost children in shootings or police custody.Mrs. Clinton's 16-point win in New York left both campaigns with a new set of strategic decisions to make. In the run-up to the New York primary, Mr. Sanders said repeatedly that he would win the state. Inside the campaign, aides anticipated a loss in New York, though they believed the margin would be closer, Mr. Devine said.With Mrs. Clinton netting 33 more delegates in New York -- and five states votingnext Tuesday -- the Sanders campaign must rethink the path needed to close the gap with Mrs. Clinton, he said.The hurdle is daunting. David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report estimated that Mr. Sanders needs to capture 59% of the remaining pledged delegates to erase Mrs. Clinton's lead.""We're going to have to win, and we're going to have to win big,"" Mr. Devine said. ""New York was a setback in terms of the scope of her victory.. . . We're trying to figure out a realistic way to win this.""For her part, Mrs. Clinton must decide when to shift focus from Mr. Sanders to her likely showdown with the Republican nominee in the fall. People familiar with her campaign's thinking on that question said not to expect Mrs. Clinton to move into a general-election posture before the five contestsnext Tuesday.Another question for both campaigns is what to do about a tone that has become increasingly caustic. Robert Reich, a Sanders supporter who served as labor secretary under former President Bill Clinton, posted a message on Facebook calling on both campaigns to knock it off.""We will need to join together to ensure one of them becomes president,"" he wrote. ""It's important we not jeopardize that future joint effort through excessive divisiveness now.""A similar dynamic played out in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton lost the nomination to then-Sen. Barack Obama. Sending a message to her disappointed supporters, Mrs. Clinton quit the race and then campaigned with her rival in a New Hampshire town called Unity. Mr. Obama hired members of her defunct campaign team in a step toward reconciliation.Mr. Sanders says he is determined to fight until the final contest in Washington, D.C., onJune 14.On Wednesday, the Sanders campaign sent out a fundraising appeal based on a report in Politico that a Clinton campaign aide used an obscenity in discussing Mr. Sanders.""Let's send our own message back to the Clinton campaign in a language they're certain to understand,"" wrote Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, requesting a donation.Clinton allies believe Mr. Sanders is the one instigating the attacks. A Senate colleague of Mr. Sanders, Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said Mr. Sanders should tone down his rhetoric.""He's never had a negative campaign, he's said, and he's never run a negative ad, and I think he's losing touch with that,"" Mr. Reid said when asked whether Mr. Sanders's attacks were damaging Mrs. Clinton.---Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",6/27/16
The Democrats' Bernie Sanders Schism; His fans see Hillary as a sellout and Obama as a letdown--and they won't stand down.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800288373?accountid=12768,"One of this year's dominant news stories is how Donald Trump has roiled the GOP. Yet Democrats face an internal rupture that may be larger and more durable. That is my takeaway after reading ""The Split, "" the New Republic's extraordinary June 14 symposium of liberal activists, historians, intellectuals, political scientists, pollsters and writers.""The schism between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is knit into the DNA of the modern Democratic Party,"" writes historian Rick Perlstein. In 1924, he recounts, Klan supporters in the party's rightward wing dominated the Democratic convention. In 1937 opponents of FDR opposed the New Deal. ""Hillary Clinton's eagerness to please Wall Street,"" he writes, ""can be traced, in part, to that ideological split.""Yale professor Jacob Hacker says that President Obama's failure to govern as a hard leftist heightened these tensions. ""There's a sense,"" he writes, ""that supporting the Democratic establishment and going the conventional route hasn't been that productive."" Duke Law professor Jedediah Purdy adds that the president promised ""transformative politics"" but didn't deliver ""the substance.""The critique of Mr. Obama sometimes sounds vaguely Republican: ""The Democratic Party today engages in delusional happy talk about economic recovery,"" complains Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, ""while a staggering 47 million Americans are struggling in poverty."" By contrast, writer and left-wing activist Mychal Denzel Smith says young Democrats are unhappy with ""the ways economic inequality persists,"" and activist Astra Taylor bemoans the Democrats' failure to follow through on the vision of Occupy Wall Street.Some of the symposium's participants also attack Bill Clinton. Mr. Smith doesn't name the former president but suggests that his anticrime bill sustains ""systemic, institutionalized racism."" Mr. Perlstein adds that ""Bill and Hillary Clinton won the White House with the business-funded support of the Democratic Leadership Council, which sought to downplay the 'big government' solutions championed by FDR."" At least, political scientist Ruy Teixeira rejoices, today's Democrats are no longer ""obsessed with the national debt.""Mr. Purdy writes that Sanders supporters ""have no love for or confidence in elites, Hillary's habitus. And why should they? They've seen growing inequality and insecurity, the naked corruption of politics by oligarchic money, total cynicism in the political class."" Mr. Hacker says: ""This may be the first time in my life that there's been a full-throated critique of the Democratic Party as being excessively beholden to money and too willing to work within the system.""These disagreements are diminished for now by Mr. Trump. As Mark Green, former New York City public advocate, says, ""the programmatic differences"" between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton ""are dwarfed by the differences between either of them and the first proto-fascist president.""Still, the left's frustration over the lack of radical change is undeniable. Young and minority voters feel a keen sense of urgency. ""Clinton and the Democrats in Washington don't understand the level of anxiety that Americans, and particularly the young, feel about their economic prospects,"" writes journalist John Judis.If Mrs. Clinton wins, Mr. Hacker hopes for ""a true grassroots, longer-term movement that tries to move the center of gravity of American politics to the left."" And if she wins and ignores ""the issues Sanders has raised,"" Ms. Taylor warns, then she risks ""losing a huge swath of the Democratic electorate for years.""In any event, expect another insurgent in 2020, writes University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci: ""Digital fund-raising, organizing, and messaging have given the left the weapons not just to tilt at the establishment's windmills, but to come close to toppling them. Next time, they might just succeed.""That seems to be the outcome Mr. Sanders intends to facilitate. Anyone who thinks the Democratic Party's left will stand down soon should consult his statement Sunday about the party's platform. He criticized the platform committee for voting down planks opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, supporting a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, and proposing a carbon tax and a fracking ban.Having already criticized the existence of Democratic superdelegates and the Clintons' dependence on Wall Street largess, Mr. Sanders is laying down more markers that could serve as rallying points for an insurgent movement to disrupt the Democratic Party after November, win or (especially) lose.American politics is being convulsed, and neither party is immune. When the dust settles, the parties could look very different--especially the Democrats.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Related Articles* How Millennials Can Still Live Bernie's Dream* Bernie Sanders's Legacy* Bernie Sanders Gets No RespectCredit: By Karl Rove",7/1/16
"Front-Runners March On --- Clinton Wins Four States, but Sanders Vows to Keep Fighting",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784403379?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton swept to four primary victories over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders Tuesday night in a showing that makes her the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee.Mrs. Clinton's chief task now shifts from winning more states to unifying a fractured party and persuading supporters of Mr. Sanders to coalesce behind her. Her first step appeared to be turning down the rhetorical temperature, giving Mr. Sanders's supporters space to move in her direction.Mrs. Clinton took Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut, the three largest prizes of the evening, as well as Delaware, while Mr. Sanders pulled off a win in Rhode Island.Ahead of Tuesday's contests, Mrs. Clinton had already amassed a nearly insurmountable delegate lead. But so far, the Sanders campaign is showing little sign it is ready to step aside and make it easier for her to capture the nomination. The race has exposed deep fissures between Sanders and Clinton backers rooted in age, race and ideology, as Mr. Sanders built a passionate following among young, white, liberal voters.A new poll shows Mr. Sanders is the most popular person in the race in either party among young voters. The Harvard Institute of Politics survey showed that among 18- to 29-year-olds, 54% viewed him positively, 31% negatively. Mrs. Clinton was the favorite of African-Americans, centrists and older Democrats.One question facing Clinton allies is when they can become more direct in calling for Mr. Sanders to focus on party unity and concede he can't win the nomination.Speaking to cheering supporters in Philadelphia, Mrs. Clinton stressed the goal of bringing the party together. ""We will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together,"" she said.Mrs. Clinton offered her most direct outreach to date to Mr. Sanders's backers, saying she shares his priorities such as fighting inequality. ""Whether you support Sen. Sanders or support me, there's much more that unites us than divides us,"" Mrs. Clinton said.Mr. Sanders said late Tuesday he was staying in the race, but suggested that he recognized his biggest impact might be in pushing the party's message to the left. ""This campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform,"" he said in a statement.Polling suggests the party is becoming less unified, not more. In March, 78% of Democratic primary voters said they would be satisfied if Mrs. Clinton were the nominee. In April, that fell to 73%, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. Asked if they could see themselves supporting Mrs. Clinton for president, just 58% of Sanders primary voters said yes, with 40% saying no, according to the April poll.This has led to some uneasiness among party leaders, who fear that scars from the hard-fought campaign could make it difficult to unify the party for the general election. As the race reaches the endgame, bitterness is evident from some rank-and-file Sanders voters.At a polling place in Providence, R.I., Christine Kolasa, a retired mortgage-banking manager in her 60s, said she had voted for Mr. Sanders and would never vote for Mrs. Clinton in a general election.The candidates came into Tuesday's contest with Mrs. Clinton leading in pledged delegates 1,428 to 1,153. With superdelegates -- party leaders who can support any candidate they choose -- added to the mix, her lead stood at a more formidable 1,946 to 1,192.A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination. The five states that voted Tuesday have 384 delegates.Mrs. Clinton entered the evening with an advantage of 275 pledged delegates. Preliminary results from the Associated Press showed she would push that lead above 350.At a televised MSNBC town-hall event on the eve of the vote, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders said in separate appearances that it was the other one's job to unite the party behind Mrs. Clinton if she becomes the nominee.The best way for her to mobilize his supporters, Mr. Sanders said, was for her to adopt pillars of his agenda, including a single-payer health-care system, a carbon tax and free tuition at public colleges. Mrs. Clinton has supported none of these ideas.Mrs. Clinton bristled at the suggestion that to win over Mr. Sanders and his backers, she needs to adopt his agenda. Recalling her fight with Barack Obama in 2008, she said, ""We got to the end in June, and I did not put down conditions. I didn't say, 'You know what, if Sen. Obama does X, Y and Z, maybe I'll support him.' ""Bickering between the Sanders and Clinton camps unfolded throughout Tuesday.In a CNN interview, Mr. Sanders's wife, Jane Sanders, raised the issue of Mrs. Clinton's refusal to release transcripts of paid speeches she has given to Wall Street firms, while parrying calls for Mr. Sanders to release more of his tax returns.Asked by CNN if she was linking the release of tax records to Mrs. Clinton's release of speech transcripts, Mrs. Sanders said, ""Yep.""At the same time, a fundraising solicitation from the Sanders campaign used harsh language in describing Clinton campaign tactics. The letter says the campaign is trying to get Mr. Sanders to tone down his rhetoric and accusing him of aiding Republican front-runner Donald Trump.The email, from Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, said the Clinton campaign, in describing Sanders campaign methods, has ""used language reserved for traitors to our country, saying we are 'giving aid and comfort' to Trump.""While Mr. Sanders's path to winning the nomination is growing increasingly narrow by his own admission, staying in the race and continuing to attract money and support could strengthen his hand as he tries to push the Democratic message in a more progressive direction.Democratic operatives said that whatever the current tensions, the party will unify in the face of a Republican opponent, especially one as polarizing as either of the two leading GOP candidates, Mr. Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz.The Democrats' divisions, they added, are nothing compared to the splits in the GOP, with the top candidates calling each other names and threats of a chaotic Republican convention in Cleveland.Should Mrs. Clinton win the nomination, Mr. Sanders will support her over the Republican nominee, his advisers say. The question is how ardent will he be in backing her.---Richard Rubin, Jennifer Levitz and Byron Tau contributed to this article.(See related article: ""Trump Sweeps All Five Races, Building Big Delegate Lead"" -- WSJ April 27, 2016)Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",7/5/16
Hillary's Debt to Sanders and Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784402245?accountid=12768,"Even before the air-clearing April 19 New York primary in which Bernie Sanders was trounced and Donald Trump was a big winner, word had come of a more presidential Trump soon to be revealed. The unveiling came with Mr. Trump's victory speech, an event that occasioned near-universal excitement when the candidate used the word ""senator"" in front of Ted Cruz's name -- a reaction that said a good deal about Mr. Trump and his campaign, all of it deeply familiar.Mr. Trump's image refurbishing promises to become a show all its own, fascinating to behold, albeit with slim prospects of success. The same would be true for Bernie Sanders, also being pressed now to improve his tone -- the nudging being another of the many things the two have in common in addition to the main thing, namely the enormous role both have played in advancing Hillary Clinton's progress toward the White House.Mr. Sanders is being urged, in the interest of Democratic unity, to temper his assaults on Hillary Clinton as a pawn of Wall Street and servant of special interests -- no easy matter for a lifelong ideologue of the far left. But no accusation transmits more of a sense of high moral indignation than the regular reminders that Mrs. Clinton voted for the Iraq war in 2002 and that he did not -- a fact Mr. Sanders cites, by way of response, when facing questions about his qualifications for the presidency as compared with those of Mrs. Clinton.To hear him again and again on Sen. Clinton's war vote is to be struck by the unvarying intensity Mr. Sanders brings to the charge, the tone of a man delivering a bombshell, and one, for him, that never loses its power. His capacity to stay on message to the exclusion of all other concerns has been conspicuous throughout his campaign.When news came in November that the topics for the Des Moines, Iowa, debate among the Democratic contenders would be reordered to include national security and terrorism, no one was taken aback. No one that is but the Sanders campaign, which made bitter protest to CBS, the debate host, over this sudden change in the agreed-on lineup of subjects.The other two scheduled debaters, including Martin O'Malley, had no complaints. The broadcast would take place one night after the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris in which 130 people had been killed and hundreds wounded. It was inconceivable that a nationally televised presidential debate would fail to include a focus on this latest rampage of horror. For Mr. Sanders and his team, the Paris attacks were in the way, an expenditure of time and attention that cut into his opportunity to hold forth on the guiding principles of his campaign.The debate opened on the subject of Paris, with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O'Malley contributing detailed commentaries. Mr. Sanders declared that he was shocked and disgusted by the attacks, and that the world must be rid of ISIS -- observations he immediately followed with the announcement that he was running for president: ""because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people and what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.""Mr. Sanders then contributed his now well-known belief that the greatest threat to national security is climate change -- this along with several reminders that he had voted against the war in Iraq. The war, he declared, was responsible for the rise in terrorism.Was he, debate moderator John Dickerson wanted to know, actually now making a direct link between Mrs. Clinton's vote for the Iraq war and what was happening with ISIS, with terrorism? Mr. Sanders's reply left no doubt that this was exactly his view.In the days before the New York primary, crowds of Sanders supporters gathered in Manhattan's Washington Square Park. They were young, overwhelmingly white, trapped in a solid claustrophobic mass stretching for blocks, and happy to be there. They were largely college and high-school students, members of his most visible and devoted constituency.In an era when the young emerge from years of schooling that portrays the U.S. as the world's leading threat to peace and justice in the world -- as a militarist aggressor awash in racism, in a system run by and for Wall Street -- the Sanders campaign was a magnet. Long instructed in the progressive faith that is now established religion on the nation's campuses, they found in Mr. Sanders's politics, and his view of American society, a confirmation of all they have been taught.It becomes clearer as the Sanders and Trump campaigns roll on how great the similarity is in the picture of America conjured by those two visionaries -- an image of America the bleak, a broken society, weak, lost, oppressed by the weight of injustice and losing everywhere in the world, as Mr. Trump reports.The two have in common, as well, their conspicuous resistance to all questions, all requests for some fragment of information on the specifics of their planned goals: to make America great again, folks (Mr. Trump's trope), and a future we can believe in (Mr. Sanders's).Nothing was clearer in Mr. Sanders's now famous April 1 meeting with the editorial board of the New York Daily News than that the last thing he expected to be demanded of a candidate representing so advanced a commitment to social justice was some acquaintance with facts, or specifics as to how one might go about the goal, say, of breaking up the big banks. Mr. Sanders's wife would later tell a CNN interviewer that this meeting, with its questions, was akin to ""an inquisition.""Hillary Clinton's high negatives in the polls notwithstanding, the difference between her level of knowledge, command of policy and experience compared with these two others is unlikely to be lost on Americans who have these many months witnessed the total absence of any such qualification in either her Democratic primary opponent, or the man who may well become the nominee of the Republican Party. That is just one of the reasons Mrs. Clinton would have for gratitude if Mr. Trump is in fact the nominee.There is another reason that may well be more important. After long months of rage-mongering, the politics of gloom and the images of a broken America conjured by both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton looks, by comparison, like a model of hope and shining optimism -- no small claim, given those negatives. And no small advantage, either.---Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of the Journal's editorial board.Credit: By Dorothy Rabinowitz",7/5/16
Democrats' Platform Shows Clinton-Sanders Divide Over Wall Street; Language in nonbinding platform shows friction between party establishment and liberal activists,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801709419?accountid=12768,"The Democratic Party's draft platform calls for robust financial regulation to protect ""families and businesses on Main Street,"" but it still shows signs of the struggle to reconcile presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton's stances and those of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.The first draft of the platform, released on Friday, supports ""an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall,"" the defunct Depression-era law separating commercial and investment banking that Mr. Sanders has championed but that Mrs. Clinton has declined to support. It also calls for using the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law to ""downsize or break apart financial institutions when necessary"" and to increase regulatory scrutiny of the shadow banking sector, both of which are key components of Mrs. Clinton's campaign plans.In an editorial published in the Philadelphia Inquirer on Sunday, Mr. Sanders called those policies ""very positive provisions"" but pledged to keep working for changes to the platform prior to the convention later this month.While the party platform isn't binding, its language shows the friction between the Democratic establishment, including Mrs. Clinton, and the liberal activists who catapulted Sen. Sanders's campaign from obscurity to an important force.For instance, Mrs. Clinton has declined to rule out appointing officials who have worked on Wall Street to top financial posts, while the platform calls for cracking down on the ""revolving door between the private sector--particularly Wall Street--and the federal government.""""I will always look for the best people when and if that opportunity arises, and I think there's a lot of people around the country, not just in one place in our country, with the kind of experience that would be useful,"" Mrs. Clinton said in a June 8 interview with The Wall Street Journal . Mrs. Clinton's campaign had no immediate comment for this article.The platform also contains some provisions that are popular among the progressive wing of the party. It calls for ""empowering"" the U.S. Postal Service to offer basic banking services to people who lack access to credit, an idea championed by high-profile liberal leaders like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.The plan, however, has little chance of enactment unless Democrats control the White House as well as both houses of Congress. ""Republicans remain staunchly opposed to this proposal, and we view the odds of enactment as slim no matter the outcome in November,"" said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst with investment firm Compass Point Research & Trading.Despite the differences between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, the document shows broad agreement on the necessity of safeguarding the financial regulatory changes instituted by Congress and the Obama administration in the aftermath of the financial crisis, in particular Dodd-Frank and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly praised the CFPB on the campaign trail, including during an appearance with Ms. Warren last week.Write to Gabriel T.

"Election 2016: Clinton Counts on Others to Unite Party --- Support for likely nominee rests on moves by Obama, Trump and Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784663069?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- With her party's presidential nomination in sight, Hillary Clinton began wooing Bernie Sanders supporters to her campaign in earnest Tuesday night. But in the weeks to come, she will rely on others to finish much of the work of uniting Democrats behind her if she is the nominee.The effort begins with Mrs. Clinton, who devoted a large chunk of her victory speech Tuesday to an explanation of what unites Democrats after months of talk about their divisions. But Mrs. Clinton and her staff are walking a narrow path: They want to welcome Sanders supporters without looking like they are trying to drive the Vermont senator out of the race before he is ready to go. At the same time, the Clinton campaign is eager to turn its attention to the general election and did so in a string of hits on Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Wednesday.Interviews with Clinton campaign officials and other senior Democrats suggest three people in particular are likely to hold the key to uniting Democrats: Barack Obama, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders.Barack Obama: The president remains enormously popular inside the Democratic Party, and had considered making an endorsement during the primaries -- presumably for Mrs. Clinton -- but he held off once it became apparent that she would be able to win without him.That neutrality may give him particular credibility if and when he moves to unite Democrats around a nominee, and Clinton allies say he will be critical, particularly with young people who have flocked to Mr. Sanders's side and are essential for the future of the Democratic Party.Tom Nides, who was a top deputy to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department and is now a senior executive at Morgan Stanley, said with Mr. Obama's active support, Mrs. Clinton could reach Obama-level support from young voters, despite her poor showing with them during the primaries.""Barack Obama will be the unifying voice,"" he said.The president appears up for the challenge. ""My most important role,"" he said last month, ""will be to make sure that after primaries [are] done I'm bringing everybody together so that we focus on winning the general election.""A handful of other popular Democrats also could be helpful, notably Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who haven't made endorsements.Donald Trump: Many Democrats predict that if he is the Republican nominee, he will serve as the great unifier. They argue that no Democrat, including supporters of Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, could favor Mr. Trump, who has insulted women, Muslims, Mexicans, the disabled and others. On Tuesday night, the Clinton campaign quickly cut a video highlighting Mr. Trump's comment at a news conference the same night that Mrs. Clinton wouldn't get 5% of the vote if she were a man.""We're facing one of the greatest unifying forces in American politics. His name is Donald Trump,"" said Democratic consultant Chris Kofinis, who is unaffiliated in the primary. ""That's how we'll come together.""Mr. Trump will be particularly helpful in driving young people to Mrs. Clinton, said John Della Volpe, who studies young voters at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. His polling finds that Mrs. Clinton is seen unfavorably by 53% of voters ages 18 to 29; Mr. Trump is seen unfavorably by 74% of those voters.Bernie Sanders: Mrs. Clinton spoke passionately during a town-hall-style event on MSNBC this week about how she expects Mr. Sanders to bring his supporters around to her, just as she worked to bring her supporters around to Mr. Obama after he won their 2008 nomination contest.Clinton aides like to quote Mr. Sanders's oft-made promise to do whatever he can to keep a Republican from winning the White House. But Mr. Sanders has sent mixed signals about his level of support.Mrs. Clinton's top advisers and many others in the party say her biggest mistake would be trying to push him out of the race before he is ready.""Sanders should stay in the race until the end. He has earned that right and his supporters in the remaining states deserve the opportunity to vote for him,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior aide during both of Mr. Obama's presidential campaigns.But, Mr. Pfeiffer said,pushing his campaign to the convention if she has the nomination wrapped up makes no sense. ""That would be pointless and dishonest to his supporters, as well as a great gift to Donald Trump,"" he said.Credit: By Laura Meckler",7/6/16
Election 2016: Sanders Campaign Cuts Staff After Losing Four States,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784662825?accountid=12768,"The Bernie Sanders campaign is laying off hundreds of field staffers after a tough stretch in which he lost five of the last six nominating contests and now has virtually no chance of mounting a comeback to wrest the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton.Though Mr. Sanders has surpassed fundraising expectations, the campaign doesn't have ""unlimited resources"" and cannot afford to keep on the payroll a full complement of field staff with three-quarters of the Democratic contests completed, a person familiar with the matter said.Mr. Sanders still has staff deployed in states that vote over the next two months, including more than 40 in the biggest prize on the calendar, California. But his campaign will finish out the race with a leaner team, this person said.Before the Iowa caucuses in February, Mr. Sanders's staff totaled more than 1,000, the campaign said Wednesday. Staff size fluctuates continually, but with the cutbacks the Sanders team will number 325 to 350, the campaign said.""We no longer require many of the loyal and dedicated state and national support staffers who helped us in places . . . where the nominating contests have been completed,"" campaign spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement Wednesday.The Clinton campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The Sanders campaign has raised money at a fast clip but also spent significant sums. In March, the campaign spent $46 million, compared with about $28 million by Mrs. Clinton.The Sanders team is reassessing its prospects after losses Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Delaware. As recently as mid-April, Sanders aides believed the Vermont senator still had a chance to erase Mrs. Clinton's lead in pledged delegates. They no longer believe that is the case.An Associated Press tally shows Mrs. Clinton leading by 333 pledged delegates. With the addition of superdelegates -- party delegates and elected officials that declared their support -- she has 2,151 delegates; Mr. Sanders has 1,338. Backing from 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination.""We all recognize the degree of difficulty has increased with the results,"" Tad Devine, a senior Sanders strategist, said of Tuesday's elections. ""But we're pretty set on the course here. He'll be in this thing, and we believe we can narrow the gap in pledged delegates significantly. But I'm not going to confidently predict we will surpass her.""What hopes Mr. Sanders has of capturing the nomination rest on persuading hundreds of superdelegates backing Mrs. Clinton that they should abandon her on the argument that he would make the stronger general election candidate, Sanders advisers said.Mr. Sanders seemed to be addressing superdelegates at a rally Wednesday in West Lafayette, Ind. ""We are in this campaign to win and become the Democratic nominee,"" he said. ""If we want a candidate who will be the strongest to defeat [Donald] Trump or any other Republican nominee, you're looking at that candidate.""As its prospects dim, the Sanders campaign is focusing on the platform Democrats will adopt at their nominating convention in July. Sanders advisers hope the success they have had against Mrs. Clinton will provide leverage in shaping a platform that reflects some of Mr. Sanders's policy aims.Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser, said the campaign understands that winning the nomination may be impossible but is pressing forward in hopes of winning delegates and influence at the convention. He predicted that Mr. Sanders would win most of the 14 remaining contests, providing a jolt of momentum that could help usher in a ""different kind of Democratic Party that's much more populist and less corporate.""He said Mr. Sanders would take a range of demands to the convention. Those include rules changes that would diminish the role of superdelegates, such as making them nonvoting participants in the convention, and pushing for open primaries that allow independents to participate. Mr. Sanders has performed best in contests in which independents are free to take part.Mr. Cohen said Mr. Sanders would also press for Democrats to swear off super PAC funding in primaries and for reinstatement of the Democratic National Committee's ban on accepting contributions from lobbyists.It isn't clear that Mrs. Clinton will go along. At a recent televised town hall meeting, she noted that she's in the stronger negotiating position by virtue of her lead.---Ben Kesling contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",7/6/16
Hillary Clinton Expanding College Plan to Offer Free Tuition to Millions; Plan is a modified version of what Sen. Bernie Sanders pushed during his presidential campaign,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801891188?accountid=12768,"In a bid to win over rival Bernie Sanders and his supporters, Democrat Hillary Clinton is expanding her plan to offer free college tuition to millions of families, a modified version of what Mr. Sanders pushed in his presidential campaign.The new Clinton proposal would offer free tuition at public schools to students in families earning $85,000 a year or less, at first, with that threshold increasing to $125,000 by 2021.Mr. Sanders welcomed the plan as ""a revolutionary step forward."" Speaking to reporters, he applauded her move as ""very, very significant"" and said the new plan combines the best of both candidates' ideas. But he continued to hold off an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, who has the Democratic nomination in hand. ""This is one issue--there are other issues,"" he said.Mr. Sanders's plan would eliminate tuition at public colleges altogether. Young voters overwhelmingly backed Mr. Sanders over Mrs. Clinton, and many cited his proposal.Throughout their primary campaign, Mrs. Clinton argued that her college affordability plan was superior. Her earlier proposal guaranteed that families wouldn't have to borrow money to attend college, but insisted that students and their parents contribute what they could afford. She described this as a way to make sure everybody had ""skin in the game.""In a statement, Mrs. Clinton continued to talk about her policy in terms of ""debt-free"" college, as opposed to Mr. Sanders's more sweeping vision of ""tuition-free"" school.""American families are drowning in debt caused by ever-rising college costs and it is imperative that the next president put forward a bold plan to make debt-free college available to all,"" she said.It isn't clear how many additional families would get free tuition under the modified version compared with the original Clinton plan. The campaign also didn't say how much the new version would cost or how she would pay for it.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said the Vermont senator is particularly interested in Mrs. Clinton moving toward him on health care. ""He's pretty clearly said in interviews that he is interested in seeing some progress on this topic [college costs] and on health care,"" Mr. Briggs said.On health care, Mrs. Clinton has said that she supports allowing people who are nearing retirement to buy into Medicare. She has also said she backs a public option to compete with private insurers on the new health-care exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. But Mrs. Clinton hasn't promoted either idea or given any details.Mr. Sanders is coming under increasing pressure to endorse Mrs. Clinton from congressional Democrats, who are growing frustrated and feel that he is dragging the process out.At a closed-door meeting with House Democrats Tuesday morning, Democratic lawmakers shouted ""timeline, timeline"" and said ""answer the question,"" when Mr. Sanders was asked when he would endorse Mrs. Clinton, according to a Democratic aide.""He took a little bit of heat, and did it with grace,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D., Va.) ""He was certainly pressed--'When are you going to endorse? What is the timeline?' ""A Clinton aide said that she made the decision to modify her college plan after a meeting last month with Mr. Sanders, where the pair discussed their respective plans and ""strategized"" about the best way to promote the issue in the party's platform and fall campaign.The Democratic platform committee is meeting this weekend to consider recommendations from a drafting committee.The campaign said her new proposal would eliminate tuition for more than 80% of families, who would owe no tuition for students at in-state public colleges and universities.She is also promising ""immediate"" executive action to offer all students with college debt a three-month moratorium on repaying loans. That would give them time to consolidate loans, sign up for income-based repayment plans and take advantage of ways to reduce interest payments and fees, the campaign said.Borrowers who are delinquent or in default would have additional options. Mrs. Clinton's revised plan would also restore Pell Grant funding for summer school.Last August, Mrs. Clinton estimated her debt-free college plan at $350 billion over 10 years. Mr. Sanders said his plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years, with tens of billions more required from the states.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.comRead More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* How Clinton Is Courting Sanders Supporters* Comey and Lynch Invited to Testify Before Congress on Clinton Probe* Who Do the Clintons Listen To?* Trump Still Finds Few Backers in Congress* For Hillary Clinton, Political Fight Over Emails Is Far From Over* Sign Up: Capital Journal Daybreak newsletterCredit: By Laura Meckler and Siobhan Hughes",7/7/16
Bernie Sanders Wins Policy Concessions as Democrats Seek Unity; Hillary Clinton accepts platform changes as the primary rivals move toward a truce,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802679739?accountid=12768,"ORLANDO, Fla.--Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are finally moving toward a truce after a fierce Democratic presidential primary fight, with the presumptive nominee making a series of policy concessions and campaign hires aimed at winning the Vermont senator's endorsement ahead of the general election.Mrs. Clinton accepted changes Mr. Sanders wanted to the party's platform, including calls for abolishing the death penalty, and rolled out new policy goals in recent days that nudged her to the left in hopes of wooing her primary opponent and his voting coalition.These steps have helped ease the path to a Sanders endorsement, which could come as early as Tuesday at a joint campaign appearance in New Hampshire. In the month since the final Democratic primary, Mr. Sanders has said he would vote for Mrs. Clinton but has stopped short of a formal endorsement.""It's fair to say that the Clinton campaign and our campaign are coming closer and closer together in trying to address the major issues facing our country,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters in a weekend conference call.It is unclear whether Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders would make a potent duo on the campaign trail. The pair showed little warmth during the primary season, with Mr. Sanders at one point questioning whether the former senator and secretary of state was qualified to be president.

They pointed out that in the hard-fought 2008 Democratic race, Mrs. Clinton endorsed then-Sen. Barack Obama four days after the final primary.Mr. Sanders opted for a slower timetable. Advisers said he viewed his endorsement as leverage in getting Mrs. Clinton to accept a more liberal party platform that codified pieces of his campaign message.As time passed, the Clinton campaign explored asking intermediaries to reach out to Mr. Sanders to see if they could persuade him to join forces with Mrs. Clinton, people familiar with the matter say.Some of Mr. Sanders's supporters worried that if he waited too long his influence would wane, but he appears to have reaped some dividends by holding out.The 187-member Democratic Platform Committee spent two days in Orlando last week crafting a proposed document that lays out the party's beliefs and goals. On Saturday, Mr. Sanders notched a victory , with the committee approving language that calls for a $15 hourly federal minimum wage indexed to inflation. That was his position during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton backed a $12 minimum wage, though she said she favored a $15 wage in certain parts of the country.Consistent with Mr. Sanders's position, the new platform seeks the abolishment of the death penalty. Mrs. Clinton has said she favors the death penalty for certain ""heinous"" crimes.Also gratifying to Mr. Sanders was a Clinton announcement Saturday that she favored a priority of his, promising to increase spending on community health centers. Mr. Sanders said her proposal would expand access to health care, ""save lives and ease suffering.""Not everything has gone Mr. Sanders's way. A majority on the platform committee were Clinton loyalists, meaning he needed her cooperation to get the precise wording he wanted.Mr. Sanders had called for platform language opposing a 12-nation trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The trade pact is important to Mr. Obama, and the committee voted for milder language that didn't explicitly reject the TPP.Delegates at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia will vote on the platform later this month.Mindful that they would lose some platform fights, Sanders campaign aides said they believed Mrs. Clinton had shown good faith in trying to bridge differences. That has made it easier for Mr. Sanders to come around, they added.After the Platform Committee adjourned around midnight Saturday, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said the new platform is ""clear evidence that the voices of the people who voted for Bernie Sanders are being heard.

The Myths of Black Lives Matter; The movement has won over Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But what if its claims are fiction?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802596665?accountid=12768,"Editor's Note: Originally published Feb. 11, 2016A television ad for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign now airing in South Carolina shows the candidate declaring that ""too many encounters with law enforcement end tragically."" She later adds: ""We have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism.""Her Democratic presidential rival, Bernie Sanders, met with the Rev. Al Sharpton on Wednesday. Mr. Sanders then tweeted that ""As President, let me be very clear that no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will."" And he appeared on the TV talk show ""The View"" saying, ""It is not acceptable to see unarmed people being shot by police officers.""Apparently the Black Lives Matter movement has convinced Democrats and progressives that there is an epidemic of racist white police officers killing young black men. Such rhetoric is going to heat up as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders court minority voters before the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary.But what if the Black Lives Matter movement is based on fiction? Not just the fictional account of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., but the utter misrepresentation of police shootings generally.To judge from Black Lives Matter protesters and their media and political allies, you would think that killer cops pose the biggest threat to young black men today. But this perception, like almost everything else that many people think they know about fatal police shootings, is wrong.The Washington Post has been gathering data on fatal police shootings over the past year and a half to correct acknowledged deficiencies in federal tallies. The emerging data should open many eyes.For starters, fatal police shootings make up a much larger proportion of white and Hispanic homicide deaths than black homicide deaths. According to the Post database, in 2015 officers killed 662 whites and Hispanics, and 258 blacks. (The overwhelming majority of all those police-shooting victims were attacking the officer, often with a gun.) Using the 2014 homicide numbers as an approximation of 2015's, those 662 white and Hispanic victims of police shootings would make up 12% of all white and Hispanic homicide deaths. That is three times the proportion of black deaths that result from police shootings.The lower proportion of black deaths due to police shootings can be attributed to the lamentable black-on-black homicide rate. There were 6,095 black homicide deaths in 2014--the most recent year for which such data are available--compared with 5,397 homicide deaths for whites and Hispanics combined. Almost all of those black homicide victims had black killers.Police officers--of all races--are also disproportionately endangered by black assailants. Over the past decade, according to FBI data, 40% of cop killers have been black. Officers are killed by blacks at a rate 2.5 times higher than the rate at which blacks are killed by police.Some may find evidence of police bias in the fact that blacks make up 26% of the police-shooting victims, compared with their 13% representation in the national population. But as residents of poor black neighborhoods know too well, violent crimes are disproportionately committed by blacks. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, though they made up roughly 15% of the population there.Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities, raising officers' own risk of using lethal force.The Black Lives Matter movement claims that white officers are especially prone to shooting innocent blacks due to racial bias, but this too is a myth. A March 2015 Justice Department report on the Philadelphia Police Department found that black and Hispanic officers were much more likely than white officers to shoot blacks based on ""threat misperception""--that is, the mistaken belief that a civilian is armed.A 2015 study by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Greg Ridgeway, formerly acting director of the National Institute of Justice, found that, at a crime scene where gunfire is involved, black officers in the New York City Police Department were 3.3 times more likely to discharge their weapons than other officers at the scene.The Black Lives Matter movement has been stunningly successful in changing the subject from the realities of violent crime. The world knows the name of Michael Brown but not Tyshawn Lee, a 9-year-old black child lured into an alley and killed by gang members in Chicago last fall. Tyshawn was one of dozens of black children gunned down in America last year. The Baltimore Sun reported on Jan. 1: ""Blood was shed in Baltimore at an unprecedented pace in 2015, with mostly young, black men shot to death in a near-daily crush of violence.""Those were black lives that mattered, and it is a scandal that outrage is heaped less on the dysfunctional culture that produces so many victims than on the police officers who try to protect them.Ms. Mac Donald is the Thomas W.

Election 2016: Sanders Warns of Floor Fight,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787231314?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday he would lead a floor fight at this summer's Democratic National Convention if the party doesn't put his supporters on key committees.In a letter, he told Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz that he suspects she is trying to pack these panels with backers of front-runner Hillary Clinton.""If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention,"" Mr. Sanders wrote.With little chance to win the Democratic presidential nomination, the Sanders campaign is increasingly focused on winning as many delegates as possible in hopes of pressing his agenda at the July gathering in Philadelphia. There are three key committees: rules, credentials and platform, in addition to a 15-member platform drafting committee, and he wants equal representation on all of them.Mr. Sanders said his campaign had submitted more than 40 people, but only three had been chosen for the three panels, and none to the rules committee. Each committee has members elected in the states and others handpicked by the DNC chief.""If we are to have a unified party in the fall, no matter who wins the nomination, we cannot have a Democratic National Convention in which the views of millions of people who participated in the Democratic nominating process are unrepresented in the committee membership appointed by you, the Chair,"" Mr. Sanders wrote.This is just the latest dispute between the Sanders campaign and the DNC. The campaign has accused Ms. Wasserman Schultz of creating a primary debate schedule to benefit Mrs. Clinton. In December, the DNC found that the Sanders campaign had improperly accessed Clinton voter files in a shared database and cut off the campaign's access to its own files. That prompted a short-lived lawsuit abandoned after the DNC restored his access.Mr. Sanders wrote that Ms. Wasserman Schultz told him she would consider allowing the Sanders and Clinton campaigns each to submit names, and that she would then choose some from each list, and then add others of her own choice. He said that was not sufficient, and that the Clinton and Sanders campaigns should each be able to appoint an equal number.He added that the chairs of the rules and platform committees are ""aggressive attack surrogates"" for Mrs. Clinton. That's a reference to Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who will co-chair the platform panel, and former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who will co-chair the rules panel.Mr. Sanders said he and his backers have no confidence that either of them ""will conduct committee proceedings in an even-handed manner.""In an interview, Mr. Frank said he wasn't aware of any contentious issues -- or, really, any issues at all -- that his rules committee will consider that would affect this year's convention. He said he would press for some changes for the future, such as the role of superdelegates, though he said he doesn't think those issues are under his committee's jurisdiction. He said he is still investigating exactly what his committee's jurisdiction is.But he said that it is fair for Mr. Sanders to be represented, certainly on the platform committees, where issues will be debated.""I would advise Debbie there should be some compromise on that,"" he said.He added that he would step down from the committee chairmanship if he thought there would be a rules issue that would affect the outcome of the nomination or threatened party unification.""If my being chairman of the rules committee becomes a kind of serious obstacle to getting everybody to vote against Donald Trump, I guess I would say defeating Donald Trump does seem to be more important than me being chairman of a committee that doesn't pay anything and doesn't have any real public policy power,"" he said.DNC spokesman Luis Miranda responded to the Sanders letter by saying the DNC is treating everybody fairly in drafting the platform.""Because the party's platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process,"" he said in a statement. ""Both of our campaigns will be represented on the drafting committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate.""Credit: By Laura Meckler",7/11/16
Election 2016: Sanders Backers Aim to Keep His Vision Alive,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787026854?accountid=12768,"As Bernie Sanders's prospects of reaching the White House fade, his hard-core supporters are taking steps to convert the enthusiasm surrounding his candidacy into an enduring movement that pushes the Democratic Party further left and promotes parts of the liberal agenda he has championed.A loose-knit coalition of ex-Sanders aides and allies are exploring ways to elect like-minded candidates to Congress and influence the Democratic Party platform at the convention in Philadelphia in July.They are planning an event in Chicago in June, ""The People's Summit,"" a likely forum for discussions about keeping the Vermont senator's vision alive even if there is no Sanders presidency.""The real question is how do you take those people who are mobilized and all their energy and begin to build local organizations that can actually play a political role in their communities,"" said Joseph Schwartz, vice chairman of Democratic Socialists of America, one of the groups planning to take part in the summit.What part Mr. Sanders might play in a new movement is unclear. He hasn't given up on defeating front-runner Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. Aides say he hasn't committed to attending the summit in Chicago and they indicated he isn't looking past the primary race.""Our focus is on giving voters in California, Oregon, West Virginia and other states that still haven't voted a chance to take part in the democratic process,"" said Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs.Fresh in the minds of older Sanders backers are Jesse Jackson's presidential bids in the 1980s. Like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Jackson attracted passionate voters, but when he lost, some were left disillusioned that Mr. Jackson's ""Rainbow Coalition"" didn't do more to shape the nation's politics.Sanders supporters hope to build on the surprising strength the senator has shown in the primaries. That is a tougher sell without a charismatic candidate on the trail, but Sanders allies say his campaign revealed a widespread desire for a more liberal tilt to party politics.""Bernie's made it remarkably clear that there is an enormous audience for sensible, progressive politics, and shame on us if we don't take advantage of that,"" said Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party, a third-party group that shares Mr. Sanders's concerns about income inequality.A collection of Sanders volunteers and former staff have started a group called Brand New Congress, which is trying to recruit congressional candidates who are in sync with Mr. Sanders's message.""Whether Bernie wins or not, we'll be implementing the plan,"" said Kristellys Estanga, 28, of Jacksonville, Fla.Another focus is the party platform to be negotiated at the convention. Sanders supporters see it as a chance to reshape the party's identity.Even if he loses to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders will have a large share of delegates who want enshrined in the platform many of his ideas: a single-payer, government-run health-care system, a $15 minimum wage, and limits on the role of superdelegates in primaries. That could set up a clash, given that Mrs. Clinton has her own agenda to promote.Making matters tougher for the Sanders forces, the Democratic National Committee has named pro-Clinton co-chairs of the rules and platform committees: former Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, respectively.Many delegates will come from the National Nurses United union, one of the most outspoken players in the Sanders coalition. Union leaders said these delegates intend to aggressively push for a platform reflecting Sanders's vision.""It's going to be the most explosive Democratic Party convention in history,"" said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of the union. ""People are not going to sit still.""Credit: By Peter Nicholas",7/11/16
Election 2016: Sanders Renews His Push For More Superdelegates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785699233?accountid=12768,"Trailing Hillary Clinton and with time running out, Bernie Sanders said Sunday he can still win the Democratic presidential nomination, though he conceded he faces an ""uphill climb"" that involves persuading hundreds of party insiders known as superdelegates to switch sides and support his candidacy.Speaking on the first anniversary of entering the primary race, Mr. Sanders said the superdelegates, who play a role in picking the Democratic nominee, should consider polls showing him to be the stronger general-election candidate against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. He added that superdelegates living in states he won decisively should respect the voters' preferences and back him.Mr. Sanders indicated he isn't about to bow to calls for party unity and stand aside while his rival gets the nomination, noting that Mrs. Clinton likely would need superdelegates to help her clinch the nomination.With Mr. Sanders competing with her to win superdelegates, he said the nominating convention in Philadelphia in July will be a ""contested"" one.But the focus on superdelegates underscores Mr. Sanders's predicament. He ran as an outsider determined to usher in ""political revolution"" and repudiate ""establishment politics."" Now he is pinning his hopes on the prospect that superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials -- will abandon Mrs. Clinton in numbers that would hand him the nomination. ""Nothing I'm telling you today suggests this is going to be an easy climb,"" Mr. Sanders said.After the news conference in Washington, one of his senior advisers, Tad Devine, was asked if the Sanders strategy was ""strange"" given his anti-Establishment message. ""Can I use 'ironic' instead of 'strange?' "" Mr. Devine replied.After winning five of the last six states, Mrs. Clinton pushed an already commanding lead to 327 pledged delegates, the kind selected by voters.By the Sanders campaign's calculations, he would need to win 65% of the pledged delegates to close the gap in the 14 contests that are left. While not ""impossible,"" Mr. Sanders said, ""that is, admittedly, and I do not deny it for a second, a tough road to climb. . .""Superdelegates are free to back whomever they choose. They now support Mrs. Clinton by a margin of 520-39, according to an Associated Press tally.Many are siding with Mrs. Clinton, even though Mr. Sanders won their states by large margins. He cited some examples. Despite winning the caucuses in Washington state with 73% of the vote, Mr. Sanders is backed by none of the state's superdelegates, he said. Instead, 10 superdelegates in Washington favor Mrs. Clinton.For some superdelegates, that argument falls flat. They say they have larger responsibilities to the party and country and shouldn't be bound by how their states voted.Billi Gosh is a superdelegate from Mr. Sanders's home state of Vermont, where he beat Mrs. Clinton by 74 percentage points. Ms. Gosh is backing Mrs. Clinton, pointing to reasons that center on credentials.""I'm voting for the person who, (a), I think will win and (b), who is the most qualified and will be an outstanding president,"" Ms. Gosh said. ""And that's Hillary Clinton.""The Clinton campaign declined to comment.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",7/11/16
"Election 2016 Is Propelled by the American Economy's Failed Promises; U.S. leaders in 2000 anticipated an era of rising prosperity. Much went wrong in ways few foresaw, laying groundwork for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802226669?accountid=12768,"When U.S. economic leaders in April 2000 gathered in the White House to mark a decadelong expansion, the consensus was clear. Trade, technology and a wise central bank had helped fuel an era of rising prosperity.Stick to that model, Alan Greenspan, then Federal Reserve Chairman, told the assembly, and ""I do not believe we can go wrong.""Much did go wrong. The economic stability and robust growth the U.S. enjoyed in the previous decade proved to be in its final throes. After 2000, the economy would experience two recessions, a technology-bubble collapse followed by a housing boom, then the largest financial crisis in 75 years and a prolonged period of weak growth.The past decade and a half has proved so turbulent and disappointing it has upended basic assumptions about modern economics and our political system. This string of disappointments has resulted in one of the most unpredictable and unconventional political seasons in modern history, with the rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.Median household income, accounting for inflation, has dropped 7% since 2000, and the income gap widened between the wealthy and everyone else. Even though official measures of unemployment have receded from postrecession peaks, seven in 10 Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track, the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found.The 2016 election is shaping up in large part as a referendum on an economic model that is widely seen as failing. Messrs. Trump and Sanders argue that policies celebrated 16 years ago no longer work for most Americans, a message that is resonating widely among those who have most suffered the consequences. Mr. Trump confounded expectations to win his party's presumptive nomination. Mr. Sanders, though losing his, will take his message to the convention and has yanked his party to the left.The PromiseAmerica had an economic model that wouldn't fail.The RealityAmerican median household incomes, adjusted for inflation, have fallen 7% since 2000. In the process, a persistent majority of individuals have come to believe the country is on the wrong track.This article begins a series examining the economic roots of that disillusionment and its social and political consequences.The disappointments are many and deep seated. China, whose vast market seemed to promise prosperity for U.S. exporters, itself became a giant exporter, dealing blows to U.S. communities far more damaging than earlier import waves from Japan and Mexico.Technology delivered gadgets and software but didn't produce the anticipated economic growth or jobs, especially for those without advanced education. Central bankers, once deified globally, couldn't foresee or manage the financial storms that eventually leveled the global economy.Economic maelstroms deepened social problems, as working-class communities especially were challenged by drugs, out-of-wedlock births, a dearth of employment opportunities, suicides and fraying social institutions. The problems are scrambling Democrats and Republicans, sending them to new populist frontiers and forcing party leaders to grapple with their purpose and values.Contributing to the rethink is a sense that Washington, because of gridlock, venality or incompetence, is itself broken and can't fix what ails America.Workers have come out short-handed. In 2000, they collected 66% of national income through wages, salaries and benefits. That dropped to 61% after the recession and has only recently partially recovered. Profits have risen to 12% of income from 8%.In the process, 30 years of established wisdom about how to manage capitalism has been upended by events and challenged by Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders--the most serious challenge thus far to the post-Cold War economic consensus. Red states and blue states are being redefined along new lines: haves and have-nots.A recent Pew Research Center poll found 61% of Trump supporters and 91% of Sanders supporters see the economic system as tilted toward powerful interests. Both embrace a new nationalism that rejects global integration and the influence of what they describe as moneyed interests.It isn't just the public rethinking the old model. Among policy makers and leading economists themselves, the desultory results of the past decade and a half have prompted soul-searching and a re-evaluation of some central tenets of what drives prosperity.""I went back to square one and asked, 'Where did I miss it and why?' "" Mr. Greenspan says. He was wrong about his faith that markets on balance acted rationally, he says. ""I had presumed that irrational behavior on the whole was essentially random and produced nothing of value.""Instead, he says, bouts of fear and greed are systematic, leading markets to overshoot and undershoot.""We've all had to get a dose of humility,"" says Martin Baily, chairman of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers in 2000 and an attendee at that celebratory White House reception.The PromiseCentral banks can manage the balance between growth and inflation and the fallout from financial bubbles.The RealityThe Fed didn't deliver the growth it expected, consistently undershot its own inflation objective, and missed the buildup of financial excesses which caused the 2007-2009 financial crisis.The economic rethinking under way is far from complete and echoes the re-examination that occurred after the Great Depression. A new army of economists is investigating what went wrong. Their work will shape how the U.S. deals with trade, monetary policy, technology, the workforce and fiscal policy for decades, though their conclusions aren't always in line with the populism embraced in the political arena.Mark Gertler, a New York University economics professor, is rewriting models for central banking and the macroeconomy, filling gaps in how economists thought financial markets and monetary policy affected the economy.For Fed officials in the early 2000s, an article of faith was that manipulating a single interest rate--an overnight-lending bank rate called the federal-funds rate--could keep the economy on an even keel. Mr. Gertler's research partner, Princeton professor and future Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, argued central banks helped create a ""Great Moderation"" of stable growth and low inflation.The moderation turned out to be a mirage.""There certainly was a lot of hubris about the ability to stabilize the economy,"" says Mr. Gertler.Mr. Gertler is seeking new ways to account for the risks of financial crises, collapsing banks and other unstable financial institutions. Yet many central-banking dilemmas the last crisis uncovered remain unresolved. Among them: Central bankers aren't at all sure better regulation, the preferred tool of Mr. Gertler and Mr. Bernanke, can prevent another crisis.Perhaps most vexing, central banks themselves might spark crises by pushing rates down in a quest for growth. ""We're stuck,"" says Raghuram Rajan, the Reserve Bank of India's governor. ""We cannot admit the tools we have are less and less powerful than we predicted and may have perverse effects.""The PromiseTechnology would lead to rising incomes and broadly shared prosperity.The RealityProductivity and output growth have slowed and technology has been polarizing the workforce.At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Erik Brynjolfsson is looking at unexpected ways technology has reshaped the economy by sharply reducing jobs and adding to the pool of disillusioned workers. In the 1990s, he was among the first economists to show computer technology was finally boosting worker productivity, a crucial ingredient in economic growth.His view about workers' gains from technology has turned gloomier. Measured productivity growth has slowed dramatically. He and co-author Andrew McAfee, an MIT business-technology specialist, found that as computing power transforms society, it swallows more jobs--a development they say is accelerating.Software investment doubled to 1.6% of GDP in the 1990s, as factories and offices added computers that helped firms manage with fewer workers. The shift started hurting workers whose skills computers could replace.For a time, those with bachelors' degrees in science seemed safe from automation-prompted layoffs--their knowledge was tough for computers to duplicate--as did less-educated workers in personal service, such as home health aides. Economists argued more education was crucial to future success.That advice, says Mr. McAfee, turned out to be ""way too narrow.""Between 2000 and 2012, estimates Harvard economist David Deming, the hollowing-out of work spread to professions including librarians and engineers. Those with the right skills came out ahead, a big reason the income gap widened. The top 20% of American families accounted for 48.9% of total income in 2014, Census figures show, versus 44.3% in 1990.The U.S. is on the cusp of a new innovation wave, Mr. Brynjolfsson says, represented by Google's self-driving car. Look for demand for Uber and taxi drivers to expand, he says, then crash, eliminating another job with a middle-class salary--adding still more workers to the ranks feeling betrayed by old economic models.Most presidential elections turn on voter perceptions of the economy, from Ronald Reagan's 1980 invocation of a ""misery index,"" which combined readings of inflation and unemployment, to Barack Obama's call for a powerful government response to the 2008 financial-sector collapse.Something similar is happening today, only more dramatically. Until Mr. Trump's successful primary run, Republicans cast themselves as the champions of free markets and low marginal-tax rates. Democrats have been the party of activist government that tries to tweak the economy so it shifts in a desired direction.The economy's long underperformance has scrambled the debate. Old prescriptions, such as tax cuts by Republicans in the early 2000s and government spending by Democrats, haven't delivered prosperity, leading voters to cast about for alternatives.Those alternatives narrowed to Mr. Trump, who promised to rip up trade deals and deport millions of illegal immigrants, and Mr. Sanders, who would break up big banks, tax stock trading and match Mr. Trump as an opponent of free-trade deals.China, more than any other issue, shows the disillusionment with globalization.At the 2000 White House conference, President Clinton said expanded trade with China would ""open their markets to our goods and services.""The PromiseTrade with China and other nations would have a net positive impact on the economy as it would expose the world's largest population to U.S. goods and services, while those hurt by trade in America would adapt and be supported.The RealityTrade with China turned out to be a bigger shock to the economy than anybody expected, and the adjustment of the workforce slower.Reality has been rougher on American workers. Hillary Clinton, who pushed a Pacific Rim trade deal as secretary of state, now positions herself as tough on China and opposes that same trade deal.Mr. Trump has made China-bashing a campaign centerpiece. Of America's 100 counties with industries most exposed to Chinese imports, 89 voted for him in Republican primaries. Of the 100 least-exposed counties, before all of his competitors dropped out, 28 gave him the nod. Mr. Sanders takes a tough line on China.Economists long recognized import competition hurt some workers but generally dismissed the costs as small relative to benefits such as cheaper goods. Research from widening trade with countries such as Japan and Mexico confirmed that theory, despite activists' targeting the North American Free Trade Agreement as a job-killer.Economists were blinded, though, to the scale of potential downsides, says Gordon Hanson, a University of California at San Diego economist. His work shows how soaring Chinese imports, which picked up after Beijing joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, magnified technology's impact on jobs. ""We were the high priests protecting free trade,"" he says. ""There was a little bit of intellectual insularity.""Chinese competition, goosed partly by a currency China kept cheap, had far greater effects on U.S. manufacturing than any country since World War II--a finding MIT labor economist David Autor has helped make mainstream with Mr. Hanson and David Dorn of the University of Zurich. The trio studied 722 communities around the country and how they responded to import competition.Their conclusion overturned conventional wisdom. China was simply different, they found in a 2013 paper. Its workforce was so vast, wages so low and productivity rising so fast, it caused greater disruptions in the American labor market than any country before.""Washington and we in the establishment spent too much time celebrating the efficiency gains of trade,"" says Timothy Adams, U.S. Treasury undersecretary under President George W. Bush, ""and not enough time thinking about the people who were impacted.""Between 2000 and 2007, import competition from China accounted for 982,000 manufacturing jobs lost, about one-fourth of all manufacturing job losses. Between 1999 and 2011, work published this year found, China accounted for 2.4 million jobs lost, including manufacturing and service jobs.That loss might have been less damaging if U.S. workers were shifting from declining industries and towns and into growing ones, as they once did. However, fewer workers are willing to move, Mr. Autor and his co-authors wrote. Moreover, America is producing fewer fast-growing startups.Surveying U.S. economic prospects, former Clinton Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers invokes a Depression-era idea, ""secular stagnation,"" to argue a dearth of investment opportunities is holding back spending and growth while the income gap has created an overabundance of savings pushing down interest rates.In the slow-growth world he foresees, global trade becomes more fraught as competitors grab for pieces of a pie that isn't growing rapidly. Tensions over currency policies mount. Central banks have limited tools to cushion blows, putting pressure on fiscal policy--taxes and spending to boost investment--to spur demand.That wasn't what Mr. Summers argued at the 2000 White House conference, where he said the private sector was so abundant ""with staggering high quality investment opportunities"" it was the government's job to get out of the way.Today he says the government must help. ""The world has changed,"" he says. ""So my views have changed.""Write to Jon Hilsenrath at jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com and Bob Davis at bob.davis@wsj.comCredit: By Jon Hilsenrath and Bob Davis",7/12/16
"City News: Sanders Criticizes Casinos --- At Atlantic City rally, candidate says owners' greed hurts workers; loud boos for Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787704936?accountid=12768,"ATLANTIC CITY -- Sen. Bernie Sanders brought his message of economic revolution to the Atlantic City boardwalk Monday, drawing supporters to the struggling resort in southern New Jersey.The Democratic presidential candidate, who is hoping to win as many delegates as possible in New Jersey's June 7 primary election, criticized the ""greed and recklessness"" of casino owners who he said have attacked local workers' pension and health-care benefits. Mr. Sanders didn't address the political fight in Trenton that has left Atlantic City on the brink of bankruptcy.Atlantic City, which held a 30-year monopoly on East Coast casinos, now competes with gaming parlors in neighboring states and has lost $2.8 billion in gambling revenue since 2006. Thousands of casino workers have lost their jobs in recent years, and, as of March, the city had a nonseasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 10.3%.""When we talk about the decline of the American middle class and the increase in poverty, what we are talking about is workers right here,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Billionaires like Carl Icahn. . .come in here and attack the standard of living of dishwashers and maids.""Mr. Icahn owns two of Atlantic City's largest casinos, Trump Taj Mahal and the Tropicana. He acquired Trump Taj Mahal, named for its former owner Donald Trump, after the casino entered bankruptcy court.Mr. Icahn said in a statement that both casinos would have closed if he hadn't invested millions of dollars in them, saving and creating thousands of jobs.Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, was loudly booed at the Atlantic City rally, held at Boardwalk Hall a little over a mile from his former casino.""Oh, you know Donald Trump?"" Mr. Sanders said in response to the crowd's jeers. ""You don't think he's a brilliant, successful businessman who can bring the kind of prosperity to America that he has brought here to Atlantic City, is that your point?""Mr. Trump said through a spokeswoman that he had ""great success"" in Atlantic City before the market collapsed under competition from surrounding states.Rally attendee Kerrie Scull said she has managed to hold on to her job as a makeup artist for Scores, a gentlemen's club at Trump Taj Mahal, but her hours have been significantly reduced. The club, which used to operate daily, is now only open on the weekends, she said.""Business is slow,"" said Ms. Scull, 28 years old, who lives in neighboring Absecon. She said she is supporting Mr. Sanders because she believes the Vermont senator would create jobs and protect local unions if elected president.Many members of Unite Here Local 54, the union representing Atlantic City's casino workers, attended the rally. President Bob McDevitt said the union endorsed Mr. Sanders because he is willing to take on hedge funds, private equity and Wall Street investors that have taken over many of Atlantic City's casinos.These casinos owners are ""stripping the workers of their benefits and they're not putting any money back into the economy,"" Mr. McDevitt said.The Casino Association of New Jersey, a trade group, didn't return requests for comment.Atlantic County Executive Dennis Levinson, a Republican, said he understands why Mr. Sanders's message has resonated with voters. Still, the candidate's economic proposals, such as increasing the minimum wage to $15, are unrealistic, Mr. Levinson said.""He's never understood that it's not free,"" Mr. Levinson said. ""Someone's paying for it.""Mr. Sanders heads into next month's primary as the underdog but has gained support in recent months among New Jersey voters, according to a Rutgers-Eagleton poll.The April poll showed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's lead over Mr. Sanders narrowing for the first time to single digits, 51% to 42%.Credit: By Kate King",7/13/16
Election 2016: Clinton Forced to Keep Fighting for Votes --- The Democratic front- runner's supporters step up pressure on Sanders to stand down,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787704840?accountid=12768,"Although she retains an overwhelming lead in the Democratic presidential contest, Hillary Clinton is expected to fall short in the West Virginia primary Tuesday and could come out of May with a three-state losing streak.Democrats who support her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, show no sign that they are prepared to abandon him in deference to Mrs. Clinton's status as the all-but-certain nominee.Polling shows Mr. Sanders with a small lead in West Virginia, and even Mrs. Clinton has conceded that her chances are ""pretty difficult"" in one of the nation's least racially diverse states. In many cases, Mrs. Clinton has struggled in states where a large share of residents are white.In West Virginia, she also has been hurt by recent comments that were viewed as anticoal.Mr. Sanders also is poised for strong showings on May 17 in Kentucky and Oregon, states with comparatively few of the minority voters who have proved loyal to Mrs. Clinton in prior contests. That Mr. Sanders is still winning states at this late stage in the Democratic fight points to persistent divisions within the party as Mrs. Clinton closes in on the nomination.The former secretary of state has 2,228 delegates, about 94% of the total needed to clinch the nomination. Mr. Sanders has 1,454 delegates.Republicans also vote tomorrow in West Virginia, as well as in Nebraska, though billionaire Donald Trump is the only remaining competitive candidate.In the Democratic race, allies of Mrs. Clinton say they would like to see Mr. Sanders accept the inevitable and drop out, allowing Mrs. Clinton to focus her fire and campaign resources on Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders has said he is determined to give his supporters a chance to vote for him until the final contest on June 14. His campaign also hopes to maximize his delegate total so that he has more clout in shaping the Democratic platform at the party's convention in Philadelphia in July.""Look, if you asked what is the best thing for the party, it would be to just get this thing wrapped up and focus on Donald Trump,"" said James Carville, a senior adviser in Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential election victory.With Mr. Sanders in the race, Mrs. Clinton is compelled to spend money and time on the primaries.Losing states is ""more than embarrassing -- it is absolutely injurious to her political fortunes,"" said Doug Schoen, a pollster who has advised Bill Clinton.Mr. Sanders ""hurts her ability to solidify the party and to raise money and to campaign effectively against Donald Trump. All of those are very, very bad,"" Mr. Schoen said.For Mrs. Clinton, the costs of the prolonged Democratic race are growing more evident. On Wednesday, she is scheduled to make a campaign stop in New Jersey, whose primary is set for June 7.New Jersey is a solid blue state in presidential elections, having voted for the Democratic nominee since 1992. From the standpoint of winning a general election, it would be more useful for Mrs. Clinton to spend time in traditional battleground states, one of her campaign fundraisers said Monday.Similarly, Mrs. Clinton spent $2.7 million on campaign ads in Pennsylvania prior to the April 26 primary. She didn't want to risk losing the state to Mr. Sanders, who spent $4 million on ads in Pennsylvania.Mrs. Clinton wound up winning the state, but if she had no competition in Pennsylvania, the front-runner could have saved the money for the general election.In her 2008 presidential bid against then-Sen. Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton stayed in the race until June. So, she risks sounding unfair if she calls on Mr. Sanders to drop out. But she is edging closer to the line. In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS, she seemed to be urging him to reconsider and step aside.""Isee a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party,"" she said, ""to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share.""Should Mr. Sanders stay in the race, some of her allies want to see him spare Mrs. Clinton and exclusively target Mr. Trump.---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",7/13/16
"Bernie Sanders Endorses Ex-Rival Hillary Clinton, Ending Democratic Primary Campaign; Two Democrats present united front to fight against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803219891?accountid=12768,"PORTSMOUTH, N. H.--Sen. Bernie Sanders offered a forceful endorsement of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, ending an intense intraparty rivalry amid signs that progressive holdouts are coalescing around the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for the fall showdown with Republican Donald Trump.""I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing Hillary Clinton and why she must become our next president,"" Mr. Sanders told a crowd that blended supporters of both candidates.""This campaign is about the needs of the American people and addressing the very serious crises that we face. And there is no doubt in my mind that, as we head into November, Hillary Clinton is far and away the best candidate to do that.""The show of Democratic unity officially concluded a 14-month battle that pitted a little-known senator from Vermont against a former secretary of state, who entered the race as a prohibitive favorite. Mr. Sanders--a self-described Democratic socialist who built a passionate following among younger voters--mounted a surprisingly fierce challenge. But in the end, he fell short of Mrs. Clinton by several million votes and wasn't able to stop her from clinching the delegate race.On Tuesday, the Democratic candidates returned to New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders notched his first victory in the primary campaign. There, Mr. Sanders delivered the words Mrs. Clinton had been waiting to hear: ""She will be the Democratic nominee for president, and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States.""He also contrasted Mrs. Clinton with Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who he said would lower or even abolish the minimum wage, give tax breaks to the rich and appoint Supreme Court justices who would trample on civil liberties.""If anyone out there thinks that this election is not important, take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump will nominate and what that means to civil liberties, equal rights and the future of our country,"" Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Trump has courted Sanders voters in recent weeks, and on Tuesday, he took to Twitter to castigate the Vermont senator for supporting his Democratic rival.""I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. ""They are not happy that he is selling out!"" He added: ""Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.""In trying to win Mr. Sanders's backing, Mrs. Clinton in recent weeks rolled out new policies that he embraced on the campaign trail.For example, she moved closer to a Sanders plan that would eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities . Mrs. Clinton called for free tuition at public schools for families earning up to $85,000 a year, with the cap rising to $125,000 in five years.Over the weekend, she released a plan to increase spending for community health centers--a Sanders priority. Mr. Sanders, in a conference call with reporters on Saturday, noted that his policy differences with Mrs. Clinton had narrowed appreciably.Mr. Sanders's long-awaited show of support came after weeks of negotiations between the two camps. But by the time he offered his endorsement--more than a month after his rival clinched the nomination--many of his supporters already had gotten behind Mrs. Clinton.Polls show a majority of Sanders backers now support the former secretary of state. And on Monday two progressive groups endorsed Mrs. Clinton--the Communications Workers of America union and the Progressive Action PAC, the political-action committee of the Congressional Progressive Caucus--signaling that they would work to elect Mrs. Clinton and urging their supporters to do the same.On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said he would work to bring his supporters on board, pledging to travel the country on her behalf and telling the crowd, ""Hillary Clinton will make and outstanding president, and I am proud to stand with her today.""For her part, the former secretary of stage said it was a privilege to join forces with Mr. Sanders.""Being here with him in New Hampshire, I can't help but reflect how much more enjoyable this election is going to be now that we are on the same side, Mrs. Clinton said. ""Because you know what, we are stronger together.""Mr. Sanders highlighted areas of agreement with Mrs. Clinton, ticking through a list of issues where they have found common ground, while also acknowledging sharp differences in their policy agendas.""It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,"" Mr. Sanders said Tuesday. ""But I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee, which ended Sunday night in Orlando, there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns, and we produced, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.""Fissures were evident, though, at the platform committee meetings over the weekend, when dozens of Sanders backers voiced opposition to a ""unity"" amendment that included language suggesting Mrs. Clinton would be the nominee.Polls show Mrs. Clinton has made inroads with Sanders voters, but, clearly, more work is needed by the Democrats.A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found only 45% of Mr. Sanders's Democratic supporters have positive feelings about Mrs. Clinton.

Bernie Sanders Expected to Endorse Hillary Clinton; Campaign event with Vermont senator comes as more progressive groups back the Democratic candidate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803051362?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton will campaign Tuesday with primary opponent Bernie Sanders amid signs that some of the last liberal holdouts are coalescing around the presumptive Democratic nominee.On Monday, two progressive groups threw their support to the former secretary of state, signaling they would work to elect Mrs. Clinton and urging their supporters to do the same. And, after weeks of negotiations between the two Democratic camps over items in the party's platform , Mr. Sanders is expected to endorse Mrs. Clinton at an event in Portsmouth, N.H.The question, though, for Mrs. Clinton is whether rank-and-file voters who backed the Vermont senator fall in line.Fissures were evident at the Democratic Platform Committee meetings over the weekend in Orlando, Fla., when dozens of Sanders backers voiced opposition to a ""unity"" amendment that included language suggesting Mrs. Clinton would be the nominee.""Hillary's not the nominee!"" one person shouted. They maintained that Mrs. Clinton wouldn't officially become the nominee until delegates vote at the convention in Philadelphia this month.Polls show Mrs. Clinton has made inroads with Sanders voters, but, clearly, more work is needed.A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found only 45% of Mr. Sanders's Democratic supporters, as opposed to independents, have positive feelings about Mrs. Clinton. Some one-third of those Sanders backers said they have negative feelings about the presumptive nominee.The same poll found that more than one-third of Mr. Sanders's Democratic supporters said they would back a third-party candidate.Mrs. Clinton garners the support of 63% of those Democratic Sanders backers, while Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is backed by 14% of his Democratic supporters. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump claims 9%, and Libertarian Gary Johnson has 8%.In a tweet Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump wrote: ""Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!""Though Mrs. Clinton clinched the nomination more than a month ago, her primary opponent has continued the fight. While the public wrangling over the Democratic Party platform was the most visible sign of the two campaigns' efforts to reach a détente, a Clinton aide said many other efforts have played out behind the scenes.The Clinton campaign has met with Sanders delegates and worked to connect with the senator's grassroots supporters, particularly in states that he won during the primary. Team Clinton also has hired a few members of Mr. Sanders's campaign staff. And top Clinton campaign officials have been in contact with Mr. Sanders's most trusted adviser: his wife, Jane.For his part, Mr. Sanders has appeared to slowly warm to the idea of backing his former rival.He edged closer in a recent interview, telling PBS, ""we have got to do everything that we can to defeat Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton."" It was one of the few times Mr. Sanders has cited electing the presumptive Democratic nominee as a top goal along with defeating Mr. Trump.Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist, said polling shows Mrs. Clinton will pull in the bulk of Sanders supporters. Democratic activists remain divided, though, he said. And the event in New Hampshire Tuesday is a symbolic step that could help bridge differences.""The main point of this is to bring together the progressive activists who to some extent were at each other's throats during the primary campaign,"" Mr. Mellman said.Mrs. Clinton got a boost Monday when the Communications Workers of America delivered a full-throated endorsement of her candidacy. The union backed Mr. Sanders during the primary.The Progressive Action PAC, the political-action committee of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, also endorsed Mrs. Clinton on Monday. The caucus's two co-chairs, Reps. Raúl Grijalva (D., Ariz.) and Keith Ellison (D., Minn.), previously supported Mr. Sanders.In its endorsement, the PAC didn't equivocate, saying in a statement that ""Hillary Clinton shares our ideals"" and that the Democratic primary had strengthened her as a candidate.At the platform committee meeting where the Sanders backers broke into shouts, the committee co-chair, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, tried to calm the members.""Everybody take a deep breath,"" Mr. Malloy said.After a recess, the Clinton and Sanders teams agreed to withdraw the ""unity"" amendment.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Peter Nicholas",7/14/16
Election 2016: Another Sanders Speed Bump for Clinton --- West Virginia win gives him a boost as presidential campaign heads to West Coast,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787894219?accountid=12768,"MARTINSBURG, W.Va. -- Bernie Sanders defeated front-runner Hillary Clinton in West Virginia on Tuesday, regaining momentum and leaving some of Mrs. Clinton's backers uneasy that her path to the Democratic presidential nomination figures to be rocky to the end.""I'm always uncomfortable when she loses,"" said New Hampshire state Sen. Lou D'Allesandro, a Clinton supporter. ""Every time [Mr. Sanders] presents himself and presents his story, more people start talking about him. And that goes on and on.""On the Republican side, presumptive nominee Donald Trump easily won primaries in West Virginia and Nebraska.The New York businessman no longer has any opposition, having cleared the once-crowded GOP field. Still, he continues to campaign in primary states, pursuing the magic number of 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the party nomination.Mr. Trump spent the weekend stumping in West Virginia and Nebraska, and he appeared in the next two states on the GOP calendar, Oregon and Washington.Mr. Trump has set his gaze on the general election in the fall, setting up a fundraising team and tapping New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to lead the transition should he be elected president.A Sanders victory of any size in West Virginia wasn't about to dislodge Mrs. Clinton from her commanding position in a primary fight that has outlasted the Republican contest. West Virginia offers only 29 Democratic delegates and, under party rules that award them on a proportional basis, Mrs. Clinton was unlikely to come away empty-handed.But polls suggest Mr. Sanders could notch wins next week in Oregon and Kentucky, demonstrating that a sizable wing of the party remains attracted to his populist message and isn't yet ready to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton. Victories also tend to fuel Mr. Sanders's fundraising, giving him more money to air TV ads and prolong the fight.Mr. D'Allesandro, the New Hampshire lawmaker, said he has written emails to the Clinton campaign asking that they compete more aggressively in upcoming contests. ""You want to enter the convention with the best possible wind at your back. That means W's [wins].""At this stage in the contest, the delegate math remains decisively in Mrs. Clinton's favor. She led Mr. Sanders by 290 pledged delegates heading into the West Virginia primary. With superdelegates thrown in, her lead stood at 2,228 to 1,454. Superdelegates are elected officials and party leaders who can vote for whichever candidate they prefer.A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.Mr. Sanders reiterated in a statement Tuesday night that he intends to stay in the race: ""We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination and we're going to stay in the race until the last vote is cast.""He added: ""We fully acknowledge we have an uphill climb ahead of us, but we're used to that. We have been fighting uphill from the day this campaign began. And after all the votes are cast and counted and this contest moves to the Democratic National Convention.""Mrs. Clinton is likely to have a better month in June, when large, diverse states such as California and New Jersey hold primaries. She has fared better in states with large concentrations of minority voters.But until she clinches the nomination, she is forced to spend money and time on the primary race, lest she endure more potentially embarrassing defeats.Losses to Mr. Sanders are ""absolutely injurious to her political fortunes,"" said Doug Schoen, a pollster who has advised Bill Clinton. ""He hurts her ability to solidify the party and to raise money and to campaign effectively against Donald Trump.""One of Mrs. Clinton's top advisers suggested her campaign isn't about to waste resources and is aware that the central battle is the showdown with Mr. Trump.""You finish out the primaries, and you allocate your resources carefully and intelligently because the task ahead for the next six months is to defeat Donald Trump,"" said Joel Benenson, a senior Clinton strategist.For Mrs. Clinton, West Virginia never looked to be easy. Democrats there hold an ""open"" primary, meaning independents are allowed to take part. Mr. Sanders typically scores well among independents.Ken Mauck, 57, described himself as an independent who voted Tuesday for Mr. Sanders. ""Even though I don't agree with Bernie's politics, I agree less with Hillary,"" he said. ""She can't lead, why should I vote for her to be the leader of my county?""Mrs. Clinton did herself no favors when she said at a town-hall meeting in March that her policies would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""Though she also voiced concern for the plight of displaced coal miners, her remarks caused damage that she later sought to minimize. In a visit to West Virginia last week, she said her remarks were taken out of context and that she would work to boost employment in the state. Still, she conceded: ""I know that my chances are pretty difficult [in West Virginia], to be honest.""Mr. Sanders faces a dilemma of his own. He concedes that erasing Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead is difficult in the 11 contests that remain.David Wasserman, a delegate expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said before the West Virginia results were in that Mr. Sanders would need to win 65% of the remaining pledged delegates to pull even with Mrs. Clinton.The Vermont senator is pinning his hopes on superdelegates abandoning Mrs. Clinton and lining up behind his campaign even if he ends the race trailing in pledged delegates.Some of his supporters believe that's a flawed strategy. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), who has endorsed Mr. Sanders, said: ""I don't think it would feel right in terms of the pledged delegates if one person wins and that's overturned by the superdelegates.""---Reid J.

Ted Cruz of Texas, who returned to the chamber this week, or Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who ended his campaign in March, the independent from Vermont doesn't seem to have planned years ahead for a White House run. When he entered the race last spring, he made clear his goal was largely to promote liberal policies and press Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to embrace them.""I thought it was more an ideologically driven desire to bring issues up"" than personal ambition, Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said of Mr. Sanders's foray into presidential politics.But to the surprise of many on Capitol Hill, Mr. Sanders has stayed in the primary race longer than any of his rivals across the aisle. In addition to Messrs. Cruz and Rubio, Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina waged unsuccessful primary bids.""He's surprised a lot of people and exceeded a lot of people's expectations,"" said GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said he had expected Mrs. Clinton to blunt Mr. Sanders's momentum much earlier in the process. Instead, Mr. Sanders has continued winning contests, including Indiana last week and the West Virginia primary Tuesday.""My gosh, at his age, to be able to be as energetic as he is, that's terrific,"" the 82-year-old Mr. Hatch said of the 74-year-old Mr. Sanders. ""I don't agree with him. I think he's basically a socialist, but I give him a lot of credit.""Though Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates Mr. Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has resisted calls from some in the Democratic Party to drop out and let her focus on her race against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump.Hissupporters chalk up his success to a style that registers as authentic and to his focus on issues important to Democratic voters, including Wall Street regulation, income inequality, climate change, college affordability and campaign finance.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said he ""has big ideas that are resonating with Americans who want to fixour rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign-finance system.""His stances ""deeply resonate with the American public,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore), the only senator to endorse Mr. Sanders, concurs. ""That's why he's still in the campaign.""Some Sanders critics say his enduring popularity reflects more on Mrs. Clinton's flaws than on his own virtues. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating theformer Secretary of State's use of a private email serverto conduct official State Department business.""That says more about Hillary Clinton,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who has endorsed Mr. Trump. ""She's still losing primaries, even a mainstream state like Indiana.""Mr. Sanders also may benefit from the year's catchiest slogan. Sen. Pat Roberts (R., Kan.) deployed it Wednesday. ""Well, a lot of people are feeling the Bern,"" he said.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Bernie's Program Sells, but Consider the Cost"" -- WSJ June 7, 2016)Credit: By Kristina Peterson",7/18/16

The call for a return to Glass-Steagall surprised many on Monday, given that Republican proposals for dealing with ""too big to fail"" financial institutions have tended to focus on capital requirements, not reinstating the Depression-era law that separated the commercial and investment activities of banks. Mr. Weissman sees the inclusion as an attempt by the Trump campaign to syphon off Sanders voters from Hillary Clinton, who has not endorsed a return to Glass-Steagall (though the Democratic platform has).

Election 2016: Sanders Endgame: Populist Path for Party,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788694528?accountid=12768,"Looking to avoid a messy Democratic convention this summer, people close to likely nominee Hillary Clinton predict she will give Bernie Sanders much of what he wants on the party's platform. But at least for now, the Sanders forces are itching for a fight.Already, Mr. Sanders has accused the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee of stacking convention committees in favor of Mrs. Clinton and has threatened a floor fight if he isn't treated fairly.""This convention should be a real debating place about what the party is and what it should stand for,"" said Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser.Mrs. Clinton says Mr. Sanders has ""every right"" to continue competing until the last votes are cast, but she has made clear that she expects unity to follow. ""We're going to unify the party, and we're going to have a great convention,"" she said last week on MSNBC.The different messages reflect the candidates' situations: Mrs. Clinton is gearing up for the fall contest; Mr. Sanders is still hoping to wrest the prize from her and, barring that, push the Democratic Party closer to his populist agenda.It is possible that the two sides will reach accommodation after the voting ends in mid-June and before the convention begins in late July. At the moment, though, they appear far from an agreement over the tone and substance of the four-day gathering, which the Clinton campaign views as one of its best opportunities to communicate her vision to voters.Her campaign is in the early stages of planning the program. Meantime, people close to the campaign said they were waiting for a signal from Mr. Sanders as to what he wants and how the pair can come together.Mr. Sanders is promising a ""contested convention"" and says the nominee won't be chosen until delegates arrive in Philadelphia. His campaign also is demanding that the Democratic platform reflect his message and major changes to how the party picks future nominees.With eight states plus the District of Columbia yet to vote, it is almost impossible for Mr. Sanders to overtake Mrs. Clinton's lead among pledged delegates, the type chosen by voters. He also trails badly among superdelegates, party leaders who can vote for whomever they like.Short of an outright win, aides say Mr. Sanders will insist that a range of his positions be reflected in the platform, including a single-payer, government-run health program; a $15 federal minimum wage; expanded Social Security benefits; opposition to free-trade agreements; and free tuition at public colleges. In each case, Mrs. Clinton has alternative views that don't go as far as his do.""It's not about unifying the party,"" said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's policy chief, who will likely represent the campaign on the platform-drafting committee. ""It's about making sure we have big, bold change that will fundamentally transform the U.S. economy. . ..There are still fundamental disagreements.""Mrs. Clinton has argued that most of the Sanders plans are unrealistic. But several Clinton allies said the campaign is likely to let him insert at least some of what he wants in the party platform. That is partly because they don't see the two as being far apart and partly because they say the platform language doesn't really matter anyway.Hilary Rosen, a Democratic consultant who is close to the Clinton campaign, predicted that the campaign would have an ""open mind"" on these issues and ""a commitment to progressive values.""""We've heard time and again from Hillary Clinton in the last couple of weeks that she respects Sen. Sanders and she respects his supporters. As far as the Clinton team is concerned, most everything is on the table in terms of how do we most effectively come out of that convention united,"" she said.Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, another Clinton ally, predicted much more comity than confrontation. Disputes, he said, can be handled in a ""healthy way.""If both sides go at these disagreements with the right spirit, you can reach some clearly good agreements,"" he said.Credit: By Laura Meckler",7/19/16
Clinton to Madison: Get Me Rewrite; She tells Sanders voters that she'll revise the First Amendment.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805323262?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton wants to win over Bernie Sanders voters, and on Saturday she bid for them by reinforcing her promise to rewrite the First Amendment to limit political speech that she and they don't like.""Today, I'm announcing that in my first 30 days as President, I will propose a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and give the American people--all of us--the chance to reclaim our democracy,"" Mrs. Clinton said in a taped speech to the Netroots Nation conference of progressives. First 30 days? Who knew the 225-year-old First Amendment was in need of such urgent revision?Citizens United is the 2010 Supreme Court decision that restored the free-speech and association rights of corporations and unions. That decision was rooted, if we can use that word in polite netroots company, in the language of the First Amendment. The constitutional amendment Mrs. Clinton has in mind would have to rewrite James Madison. Dead white males may be out of progressive favor, but we suspect most Americans still trust Madison more than they do the boys at the Daily Kos.Mrs. Clinton knows that such an amendment won't pass, so she also took up the spirit of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent comments that she expects a new liberal majority on the Court to rewrite the First Amendment the easier way. ""I'll also appoint Supreme Court justices who understand that this decision was a disaster for our democracy,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""And I hope some of the brilliant minds in this room will seek out cases to challenge Citizens United in the courts."" So add one more litmus test for Mrs. Clinton's Supreme Court nominees.The presumptive Democratic nominee also said she'll press the Securities and Exchange Commission to require publicly traded companies to disclose all political spending. The point here is to expose companies and CEOs to public vilification and boycotts if they donate to the wrong causes or candidates. Instead of moving to the center, Mrs. Clinton keeps raising the stakes of this election by moving left.Related Articles* Free College, Dude* The Democratic Platform's Sharp Left Turn* ObamaCare's Next Act",7/20/16
"Bernie Sanders, Playing Catch-Up, Courts Black Voters in New York Primary; Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton has built her delegate lead with help from minorities",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781034021?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--Sen. Bernie Sanders is mounting an aggressive effort to court African-American voters in the run-up to New York's primary, scrambling to win over a constituency that has vaulted rival Hillary Clinton to a big delegate lead in the Democratic presidential campaign.The former secretary of state leads Mr. Sanders in New York by 17 points, 57% to 40%, among likely Democratic voters, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday.While Mr. Sanders's new effort is now focused on Tuesday's primary, it could also reverberate in states that will cast ballots a week after New York on April 26.African-Americans accounted for more than one-third of Democratic voters in Maryland, for example, during the 2008 primary fight between Mrs. Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama. About 20% of those who cast ballots in the party's Pennsylvania primary that year were minorities, and about 15% who voted in the New York primary that year were black, according to exit polls.In an all-out bid to reintroduce himself, Mr. Sanders is airing two TV spots in New York featuring prominent African-Americans and showcasing endorsements from civil-rights activists.He also took aim at former President Bill Clinton over a recent clash with black protesters who objected to the crime-and-punishment practices in the 1990s. It is unclear how effective that tactic may be, given that Mr. Clinton's approval rating among all African-Americans is 89%, according to a February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for politics, policy and national security news.* Live Coverage: Thursday's Democratic Debate in Brooklyn* What to Watch in Thursday's Democratic Debate* Prosecutors Won't Charge Trump Campaign Manager With Battery* Where Trump Resonates, He Is Embraced Down-Ballot* Oregon's Merkley Becomes First Senator to Endorse Sanders* John Kasich Sees a Path Through the Northeast* Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Hold Strong Leads in New York Ahead of Primary, Poll Finds (April 11)Hours before the Democratic debate in Brooklyn on Thursday, Mr. Sanders appeared at the National Action Network convention hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton, and said Republican governors around the country are using voter-suppression tactics reminiscent of the ""Jim Crow days.""Making inroads into Mrs. Clinton's advantage among African-Americans won't be easy. Another Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released earlier this week showed her with a 40-point lead among black Democrats in New York.Mrs. Clinton built her lead of 251 pledged delegates largely through decisive victories in Deep South states with large black populations, states that Mr. Sanders largely ignored in the early phase of the primary. In Alabama, for example, she took 91% of the black vote.An analysis by Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm, showed that in 21 states that have already voted, she won upwards of 77% of African-Americans, compared with about 22% for Mr. Sanders.Hoping to counter Mr. Sanders's efforts, the Clinton campaign held a conference call with three Congressional Black Caucus members on Thursday during which they cast him as a late arrival to issues important to the black community.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who represents parts of New York City, said the Vermont senator hasn't done enough to address the racial disparity in his state's prison population. Vermont imprisons blacks at nearly 13 times the rate of whites, according to data compiled by the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for improvements in the criminal-justice system. That is among the most pronounced disparities in the country, according to the group's research.""On the issue of criminal-justice reform, Bernie Sanders has been all talk and no action,"" Mr. Jeffries said.Vaughn Carney is an African-American attorney in Vermont who said that he has voted for Mr. Sanders many times over the years, but that Mr. Sanders always seemed more comfortable talking about broad issues of economic class and income inequality than about race.""His feeling is that economics is the answer, and government is the answer, and that's going to solve all the racial issues,"" said Mr. Carney, a Clinton supporter. ""I don't buy that.""A Sanders campaign spokesman didn't respond to a question about Vermont's prison population.The Clintons have had decades to forge ties to African-Americans, first in Arkansas, later in the White House, and then in Mrs. Clinton's eight years as a senator from New York. By contrast, Mr. Sanders has lived most of his life in a state that is 95% white.Still, he says he is well acquainted with the struggles of African-Americans. At the Thursday event, he drew applause and a few yelps when he noted that in 1988, as a mayor in Vermont--""an almost all-white state then""--he supported Rev. Jesse Jackson's Democratic presidential bid. ""That wasn't a popular thing to do,"" he said.Most of Mr. Sanders's success in the presidential race has come in predominantly white states.Some African-Americans at Mr. Sanders's huge rally in Manhattan's Washington Square Park on Wednesday evening said they couldn't understand why Mr. Sanders hadn't caught on more with nonwhite voters.""He's always been on the right side of history,"" said Olivier Plummer, 18 years old, of New York's Queens borough, who plans to cast his first ballot for Mr. Sanders. He carried a sign saying that he supports the Vermont senator because ""black lives always mattered--not just when it became election year.""While the candidates are also engaged in a continuing dispute over who has the stronger immigration record--an effort to appeal to Latino voters--it is in the black community where Mr. Sanders has the most work to do.One of his TV ads, produced by director Spike Lee, features prominent civil-rights activists endorsing Mr. Sanders. ""People of color have a deeply vested interest in what Bernie Sanders brings to us in this election,"" singer Harry Belafonte says.A second spot features Erica Garner, whose father, Eric, died in 2014 after a police confrontation on Staten Island. His death sparked a series of protests and political turmoil in New York.Mrs. Clinton has her own connection to the Garner family: She has received the endorsement of Mr. Garner's mother, Gwen Carr.Erica Orden and Gary Fields contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",7/20/16
Liberal Democrats to Play Major Role at Convention's Opening Night; Bernie Sanders to call for party unity and champion progressive issues,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806380225?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Hillary Clinton's campaign plans to open her nominating convention Monday with a full-throated overture to the Democratic Party's liberal wing, hoping to mend rifts and put to rest grievances that have jeopardized party unity.Two of the speakers on the convention's opening night are U.S. senators whose fiery denunciations of corporate power and wealth have made them darlings of the left: Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton's rival in the presidential primaries, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.Another is Astrid Silva, the daughter of undocumented Mexican immigrants who has become a leading advocate for a path to citizenship for people living in the U.S. illegally. An overhaul of the nation's immigration laws is a galvanizing issue for the party's Hispanic constituents, some of whom were disappointed Mrs. Clinton didn't choose a Hispanic as a running mate.A message Mr. Sanders intends to offer is that Democrats need to coalesce behind the larger goal of defeating Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, an aide to the senator said Sunday.""It will be a speech that stresses unity and the need to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump,"" Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, said in an interview. ""At the same time,"" he added, Mr. Sanders plans to urge Democrats to ""continue to push for the progressive future that his campaign was based on.""Coming into the convention, the party's liberal core has been restive, unhappy about Mrs. Clinton's selection of Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate and outraged by leaked Democratic National Committee emails that show party operatives maneuvering against Mr. Sanders's campaign.With the email controversy mushrooming, the committee's chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said Sunday she was stepping down, a move that could help mollify Mr. Sanders's supporters who have long feared he was undercut by the Democratic leadership.Jonathan Tasini, a Sanders surrogate and Democratic delegate at the convention, said that Ms. Wasserman Schultz's departure ""removes a flashpoint.""A potential pitfall for Mrs. Clinton is that by seeming to appease the liberal base in such a prominent way on the opening night of the convention, she could alienate more moderate and independent voters who are important to winning in November. The effort could undermine Mrs. Clinton's plans to position herself in the center, where most voters reside.In choosing Mr. Kaine as her running mate, Mrs. Clinton sent a strong signal that she plans to govern from the center, not the left. Indeed, in a recent interview on CBS she described the party she leads as ""center-left,"" putting particular emphasis on the word, ""center.""RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, one of Mr. Sanders's strongest allies, said of the selection of Mr. Kaine: ""It's outrageous. It was a snub to the Bernie base.""Neil Sroka, communications director of the liberal group Democracy for America, said both the DNC emails and Mr. Kaine's selection were disheartening for progressive voters. He said the Clinton campaign needs to do more to reassure the party's liberal base that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine would stand united in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation free trade deal.But he also predicted that at the end of the week, Democrats would rally behind the need to defeat Mr. Trump.""These two incidents are certainly going to leave a harsh taste in the mouth,"" Mr. Sroka said. ""But there is a deep commitment that goes beyond any one person to making sure that Donald Trump doesn't represent our country on the national or world stage.""As for Mr. Sanders, he told NBC that he would have preferred to see Mrs. Clinton choose a more progressive running mate, suggesting Ms. Warren would have been a good choice.But he offered muted praise for Mr. Kaine.""Tim is a very, very smart guy. He's a very nice guy,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""His political views are not my political views. He is more conservative than I am.""On the eve of the convention, Clinton allies took steps aimed at accommodating Mr. Sanders and his rank-and-file supporters. They accepted a platform that moves the party to the left on a series of issues.Supporters of Mr. Sanders also cheered the convention Rules Committee's approval over the weekend of a new commission that is charged with presenting a plan to reduce the clout of superdelegates, the party leaders and officials who have an outsize role in choosing the presidential nominee. Superdelegates overwhelmingly backed Mrs. Clinton.On Monday, delegates are set to a approve a platform that enshrines many of the proposals Mr. Sanders championed during the race: A $15 federal minimum wage indexed to inflation; stricter regulation of Wall Street banks; an end to the death penalty and renewed efforts to combat global warming.""The platform is a huge success,"" Mr. Weaver said.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Colleen McCain Nelson",7/25/16
Emails That Helped Cost DNC Chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz Her Job Show Democratic Discord; Messages released by WikiLeaks indicate signs of bias in favor of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806377864?accountid=12768,"The hacked emails that helped cost Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz her job depict a primary campaign marked by party infighting and smears.Among the more than 19,000 messages released by the WikiLeaks website are signs of bias in favor of Hillary Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign, undermining the DNC's stated objective of broad-based support for Democrats seeking office.""He isn't going to be president,"" Ms. Wasserman Schultz wrote in an email about Mr. Sanders in late May, according to WikiLeaks, weeks before Mr. Sanders endorsed Mrs. Clinton.Another email sent from a DNC address to two DNC communications officials indicated a plan to smear Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with a fake Craigslist job post for women who wanted to apply to one of Mr. Trump's organizations, with the title ""Honey Bunch"" and job requirements including ""no gaining weight on the job.""The emails showed Ms. Wasserman Schultz bristled at accusations of bias over her handling of the Democratic presidential primary. When MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski in mid-May called for the DNC chairwoman to step down for unfair treatment of Mr. Sanders, Ms. Wasserman Schultz in an email called the television host's allegation the ""LAST straw.""""This is outrageous. She needs to apologize,"" the DNC chairwoman emailed Communications Director Luis Miranda .In one exchange about polling in Rhode Island, a DNC staffer said of Mrs. Clinton: ""If she outperforms this polling, the Bernie camp will go nuts and allege misconduct.

U.S. News: College Sanders's Wife Led to Close,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789134920?accountid=12768,"Burlington College, a tiny Vermont liberal arts school once led by Jane Sanders, the wife of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, said it is shutting down because of financial problems associated with a property acquisition she oversaw.In a formal statement announcing its closure, the school cited the ""crushing weight"" of debt it took on in a 2010 purchase of more than 30 acres from the local Catholic archdiocese. Mrs. Sanders was the college's president at the time of the $10 million deal.The college had financial challenges before Mrs. Sanders took the helm. In her seven years there, she attempted an ambitious expansion of the school's physical footprint and 200-student body. But the major investment didn't bear fruit in terms of drawing more students and bringing in higher tuition revenue, and the school's financial health has remained fragile since. She resigned in 2011.Mrs. Sanders was set to receive total severance of $200,785 between October 2011 and October 2013, according to tax documents the school filed for its fiscal 2012 year.An attempt to reach Mrs. Sanders through the Sanders campaign wasn't answered.Mrs. Sanders received her undergraduate degree in social work from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt., and briefly served as interim president there in the 1990s. She has worked as a political consultant and is considered to be one of Mr. Sanders's closest advisers.Many smaller colleges are facing bleak fiscal futures, with many forced to offer significant scholarships to woo students but barely breaking even on what tuition revenue they bring in, as expenses continue to rise. The National Association of College and University Business Officers reported Monday that the discount rate for freshmen at private colleges this year hit a record 48.6%, meaning students pay just over 50 cents on every dollar of published tuition.Burlington said Monday that it has cut its debt to a ""manageable level"" through property sales, but learned last month that its lender wouldn't renew a credit line, which is needed to cover costs between semesters.Burlington's accreditor, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, placed it on probation in 2014 because of financial concerns. It is allowed to remain on probation for only two years.""These hurdles are insurmountable at this time,"" the school said.Burlington's board of trustees voted Friday to close its programs effective May27. The school held its commencement ceremony for the class of 2016 on Saturday.Current students will be able to complete their studies at nearby colleges, Burlington said.""I thought it was going to happen for some time,"" said Barry Snyder, an adjunct professor at Burlington and former chair of the film and media department.Mr. Snyder, who also runs the Burlington Film Society, said he had heard closure was likely about a month ago. ""It's terrible to lose an institution of this sort. It was a very special place,"" he said. ""It did a lot of good for students who didn't fit at other institutions.""---Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Credit: By Melissa Korn",7/25/16
"Gov. Andrew Cuomo Faces His Critics at Democratic Convention; Left wing of party knocks governor, even as he praises Sen. Bernie Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806943078?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Away from his home turf , New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo spent his first day at the Democratic National Convention contending with pockets of the party where he is less than popular.Mr. Cuomo, who four years ago at the convention in Charlotte, N.C., shunned all but a minor address to New York delegates and declined to stay overnight, traveled to Philadelphia to participate more fully this time and has a speaking role later in the week.But on Tuesday he felt the effects of an emboldened Democratic left wing that has been determined to make its voice heard during the convention. Appearing at a breakfast for the New York delegation alongside Bernie Sanders, Mr. Cuomo praised the Vermont senator's presidential campaign.""I also want to applaud the senator for keeping his eye on the ball,"" Mr. Cuomo said, to cheers. ""The goal for the Democratic Party is to make sure [Donald] Trump and that philosophy has no place in this country, ever.""But even as Mr. Sanders congratulated Mr. Cuomo for raising the statewide minimum wage and instituting a paid family-leave program, Sanders backers said they have already begun organizing to oppose Mr. Cuomo's re-election bid in 2018.Asked if she was a supporter of the New York governor, Sanders delegate and Queens resident Nancy de Delva said: ""I'm definitely not.""""All of his ideas are more Republican,"" said Ms. de Delva.She said she wasn't appeased by the governor's efforts on progressive ideals such as raising the minimum wage. ""These were not his ideas. Mayor de Blasio wanted all this from the beginning,"" she said.A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo pointed out that the governor had long supported increases to the minimum wage, including before Mr. de Blasio became mayor, and took unilateral actions to raise it for fast-food workers and others prior to this year.Poornima Subramanian, a University of Buffalo pharmacy student, said fellow Sanders delegates have already selected a 2018 candidate: ""We'd like to see [New York Attorney General] Eric Schneiderman run against Andrew Cuomo.""Mr. Schneiderman has said that he doesn't intend to do that.At Mr. Cuomo's other public address of the day, to the Democratic Party's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender caucus, he faced a more receptive crowd. He drew hearty applause for signing legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in New York and for describing the June mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., as ""a terrorist attack on gay Americans.""Still, even among friendly faces, Mr. Cuomo encountered some detractors in the form of protesters who disrupted his speech to voice their opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and to criticize him for an executive order to force state agencies to divest themselves of companies supporting a Palestinian-backed boycott movement against Israel.Mr. Cuomo recovered quickly from the disruption, and he was soon met with another vocal crowd member with a more supportive message concerning the state's embrace of same-sex marriage rights.Shouted one woman in the audience: ""We did it by having the best governor ever in New York!""Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comWe Want to Hear From YouHave something to say about an article in Greater New York?

Feel the Fizzle; Sanders's revolution ends with a whimper.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806746964?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Sen. Ted Cruz got booed last week for declining to endorse his party's presidential nominee. This week, Sen. Bernie Sanders got booed for endorsing his party's inevitable nominee. (Or to be precise, the inevitable nominee of the party whose nomination Sanders was contesting. As far as we know, Sanders still isn't formally a Democrat.)And it happened to Sanders twice. As the Daily Caller notes, Sanders told an early-afternoon rally, ""We have got to elect Hillary Clinton"":The boisterous crowd interrupted his speech with boos after he stated his support for Clinton and Tim Kaine.Sanders went on to say, ""Brothers and sisters, this is, this is the real world that we live in.""Sanders delegates, meanwhile, were threatening to unleash ""chaos"" at the convention, Mother Jones's David Corn reported:As thousands of delegates to the Democratic convention hit the City of Brotherly Love (and Sisterly Affection), it was clear that the Clinton campaign's talk of unity, in the wake of announcing Tim Kaine as Clinton's running mate, was more hope than reality.OK, stop right there. ""And Sisterly Affection""? Really? If you're going to rewrite Philadelphia's old motto to make it politically correct, why do it in such a transphobic way? You might as well call it the City of Binary Love.We missed Sanders's rally speech, as we spent the morning and early afternoon working at Philadelphia's elegant Union League Club. But we determined we'd see him address the convention during the evening. Walking out onto Broad Street at midafternoon, we found it closed to traffic as Sanders supporters marched.The mood was angrier than at Sunday's rally . The crowd chanted, ""Hell, no, DNC! We won't vote for Hillary!"" and ""If we don't get it, shut it down!"" Again there were interesting bespoke signs and banners. ""Voting won't solve capitalism,"" read one (pictured above). Another mansplained : ""Hey Hillary: First rule of all lives matter is don't bomb people. So shut up."" One marcher flew a North Korean flag.We rode the Septa subway--which, by the way, was clean and reasonably efficient--to the terminus, known as the AT&T station. (Apart from underground cell towers, there's no AT&T facility nearby. The telecom corporation purchased naming rights from Septa.)Hundreds of pro-Sanders protesters had gathered near the station, determined to inflict their message on delegates. We passed the security checkpoint and found a long row of protesters pressed up against the metal barrier --hey, we thought these guys built bridges, not walls--and heard the same chants: ""Hell, no, DNC! . . ."" They looked like they were in a cage, though actually we were the ones on the inside.Things soon got even worse for the delegates. U.S. News reported at 4:50 p.m.--less than an hour after we arrived--that authorities had shut down the AT&T station ""due to 'security measures' as protesters marched outside."" That meant delegates had to walk an extra three-quarters of a mile in mid-90s temperatures. Talk about feeling the burn.The convention itself got off to a rocky start, Vox's Libby Nelson reports:Just moments after the convention officially opened, it devolved into internecine warfare. . . . Every time Hillary Clinton's name was mentioned at the outset, delegates booed loudly from the floor. . . . The ""lock her up"" chant--a favorite of delegates to the Republican National Convention that was heavily criticized--has made an appearance at the Democratic convention as well.The Hill reports that Sanders sent a message to supporters ""asking, as a 'personal courtesy to me,' that they not protest or demonstrate on the floor"":""Our credibility as a movement will be damaged by booing, turning of backs, walking out or other similar displays,"" he wrote in the email. ""That's what corporate media wants. That's what [GOP presidential nominee] Donald Trump wants.""As we watched the early proceedings on TV from the press center, we noted at one point a CNN chyron that read BREAKING NEWS: MOMENT OF SILENCE AT DNC. We suppose that would qualify as a man-bites-donk story.The good news for journalists was that the press work area was right across the street from the Wells Fargo Center (named after a bank, O the irony!), site of the convention. The bad news was that the DNC put us journos into big tents. When an early-evening thunderstorm struck, water started dripping in--a literal DNC leak . To judge by some of the tweets compiled by Twitchy , other news organizations got rained on considerably worse than The Wall Street Journal did. But there are still three days to go.At length the rain stopped and we made our way over to the Wells Fargo. We planned to stay through Sanders's speech then leave, allowing us to make a reasonably early night of it. But we discovered the order of the speakers had changed, so that Sanders would go on last. By the time he was finished, it was past 11 p.m.--outside of prime time in the Eastern and Central time zones.The delay did afford us the ability to see a good cross-section of DNC speakers. By far the star of the evening was Michelle Obama , who denounced Donald Trump as a bad influence on children. She described her and Barack's approach to rearing their daughters:With every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us. We as parents are their most important role models. And let me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady because we know that our words and actions matter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country, kids who tell us I saw you on TV, I wrote a report on you for school.Kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband, his eyes wide with hope and he wondered, is my hair like yours?She's got a point there: Imagine a little kid looking at Donald Trump and asking ""Is my hair like yours?""It's something of a role reversal that Democrats are portraying themselves as wholesome vs. the transgressive Republicans, but it's certainly fitting given the public personae of the Obamas and Trump, respectively. Mrs. Obama had high praise for Mrs. Clinton, as you'd expect, but didn't mention her until after the role-model riff.Mrs. Obama also took issue with Trump's slogan:So, look, so don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again. Because this right now is the greatest country on earth!Which raises the questions: Was America great before the Obamas arrived in the White House? And if so, why did Mr. Obama see a need for ""fundamentally transforming"" it?Mrs. Obama's happy talk was in contrast with the later speeches of Elizabeth Warren and Sanders, both of which were, if we may employ a five-day-old cliché, dark.""America isn't going broke,"" Warren said, striking what turned out to be a deceptively optimistic note:The stock market is breaking records. Corporate profits are at all-time highs. CEOs make tens of millions of dollars. There's lots of wealth in America, but it isn't trickling down to hard-working families like yours.Does anyone here have a problem with that? Well, I do too.People get it: the system is rigged.You know who else said the system is rigged?There was some irony in Warren's complaining of a ""rigged"" system when the DNC's nomination system had just been proven rigged in favor of the candidate she was endorsing. The crowd's response to Warren was notably tepid, especially by comparison with Mrs. Obama. At several points she was heckled. We couldn't make out what the hecklers were saying, but Business Insider reports:""We trusted you! We trusted you!"" factions of the audience chanted. . . . Loud boos and jeers came soon after, when the Massachusetts senator said it was imperative that [Mrs.] Clinton and Tim Kaine, her running mate, be elected to the White House.And toward the end of Warren's speech, the more progressive delegates began chanting again.""Goldman Sachs! Goldman Sachs!"" portions of the crowd chanted.Chants of ""tax Wall Street"" also came from the crowd.Likewise Sanders 's speech was dark:This election is about ending the 40-year decline of our middle class--the reality that 47 million men, women and children live in poverty. It is about understanding that if we do not transform our economy, our younger generation will likely have a lower standard of living than their parents.This election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we currently experience, the worst it has been since 1928. It is not moral, not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one-tenth of one percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%, or that the top 1% in recent years has earned 85% of all new income. That is unacceptable. That must change.Nor were the cheers for him very enthusiastic--except toward the end, when he called for ""strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership."" Trump couldn't have said it better.Even we heard the boos from Sanders supporters when he began his coda with an exhortation to vote for Mrs. Clinton. And you can see why they were unhappy. Sanders more or less acknowledged he was urging a choice of the lesser evil:Any objective observer will conclude that--based on her ideas and her leadership--Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States. The choice is not even close.In response, Trump tweeted : ""Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.""Earlier, Sarah Silverman had appeared with Sen. Al Franken in the dullest assemblage of former ""Saturday Night Live"" talent since Norm Macdonald dined alone. As the Chicago Tribune notes, Silverman, who supported Sanders, said: ""Can I just say to the 'Bernie or bust' people, you're being ridiculous.""She has a point--and so does Sanders. If you want America to become more like Denmark, or like North Korea, Bernie Sanders was the best of the candidates seeking either party's nomination. But given the remaining options (and setting aside Green Jill Stein), Mrs. Clinton, bad as she is, is obviously better by lefty lights than Trump.It seems to this columnist the Nevertrump conservatives are also being ridiculous. Trump is arguably the least conservative of the 17 Republicans who sought the nomination, and he has some glaring character flaws. But Mrs. Clinton is much worse. From a conservative standpoint, to quote Sanders, ""the choice is not even close.""So why did the supposedly idealistic Sanders, in contrast with Cruz, make the ideologically practical calculation that it's better to elect the lesser of evils? Maybe because he, who will be 79 by Election Day 2020, is unlikely to run for president again. Cruz is nearly three decades Sanders's junior, young enough to harbor intense ambitions. Though he might have better served those ambitions with a Sanders-like show of selflessness.Worst Appeals to Authority ""Geraldo Vouches for US General Accused of Plotting Failed Turkish Coup""--headline, FoxNews.com, July 25We Blame George W.

Emails Show DNC Taking Aim at Bernie Sanders; Hack appears to show a continuing rift between the party and the primary runner-up,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806538881?accountid=12768,"Private emails released Friday by the WikiLeaks website have rocked the Democratic Party at its convention this week, just as party leaders aim to appear unified behind presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.The hacked emails , which appear to show evidence of a continuing rift between the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's primary rival, Bernie Sanders, caused an uproar among the Vermont senator's supporters, who alleged during the primary that the DNC was unfairly tipping the scale in favor of Mrs. Clinton.DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is stepping down from her role in light of the email leak.Brian Fallon, press secretary for Mrs. Clinton, told reporters Monday that the campaign doesn't condone the content of the leaked emails, singling out as particularly egregious one message that questioned Mr. Sanders's Jewish faith and suggested casting the Vermont senator as an atheist. The DNC in a statement apologized to Mr. Sanders about the emails.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Monday the role played by staffers at the DNC ""should be scrutinized"" and others dismissed if warranted. Donna Brazile, who will serve as interim DNC chairwoman, said she would conduct a probe before making any decisions about whether additional officials should lose their jobs.Of the more than 19,000 emails sent from DNC officials between early 2015 and mid-2016 that were dumped online by WikiLeaks (and are available by search ), here are nine that stand out:1. April 24, 2016 : DNC officials discuss a television appearance that day by Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Communications Director Luis Miranda writes, ""She can't take Sanders on directly, it would turn into a fight and any time it's DNC Chair vs Sanders, DNC Chair is going to lose.""2. April 24, 2016 : Ms. Wasserman Schultz, responding to an email about Mr. Sanders's saying he will stay in the primary race until the end, writes, ""Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.""3. May 5, 2016 : DNC officials appear to suggest a plan to bring Mr. Sanders's religion into the primary narrative. In an email from Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall to Chief Executive Amy Dacey, Mr. Marshall writes, ""It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist.""In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr. Marshall apologized for what he called ""insensitive, emotional emails.""4. May 13, 2016 : In an email to DNC press secretary Mark Paustenbach, Ms. Wasserman Schultz calls Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver ""an ASS"" for his comments about taking the primary fight to the convention.5. May 17, 2016 : When sent Mr. Weaver's comments on Sanders supporters protesting in Nevada, Ms. Wasserman Schultz says, ""Damn liar. Particularly scummy that he barely acknowledges the violent and threatening behavior that occurred."" Mr. Weaver had called on protesters to act civilly, but accused the Nevada state party of ignoring votes from the floor of the state convention.6. May 18, 2016 : Ms. Wasserman Schultz writes to MSNBC's Chuck Todd asking to discuss unfavorable coverage from the network's program, ""Morning Joe."" The email's subject line is, ""Chuck, this must stop.""7. May 18, 2016 : Christina Freundlich, DNC deputy communications director, asks for approval to post a fake job listing on Craigslist for women who want to apply to jobs at one of Donald Trump's organizations. The requirements for the job, listed in the email, include ""no gaining weight on the job"" and ""must be open to public humiliation and open-press workouts if you do gain weight on the job.""8. May 21, 2016 : The communications team floats the idea of creating an anti-Sanders narrative. Mr. Paustenbach emails Mr. Miranda: ""Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess.""9. May 21, 2016 : Responding to Mr. Sanders's remarks that he would not reappoint Ms. Wasserman Schultz if he were elected president, the DNC chairwoman writes, ""This is a silly story. He isn't going to be president.""Write to Julian Routh at Julian.Routh@wsj.comRelated Coverage* DNC Hack Prompts Allegations of Russian Involvement* Twelve DNC Emails Released by WikiLeaks That Stand Out* Debbie Wasserman Schultz Won't Address Democratic Convention* On Eve of Democratic Convention, Party Seeks Unity With Official's Ouster* DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Resign Amid Email HackCredit: By Julian Routh",7/26/16
"For the Bernie Sanders Army, the Fight Isn't Over; At the Democratic convention, the senator's supporters vent their unhappiness",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806538224?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Sen. Bernie Sanders raised an angry army to propel him through this year's presidential primaries. He didn't win that war, but his foot-soldiers showed on Monday they had one more battle they wanted to fight.That fight unfolded here on the first day of the Democratic Party's national convention . Sanders supporters took to the streets, to the hotel ballrooms where state delegations were meeting and ultimately to the floor of the convention itself to vent their unhappiness with the way they say they were treated by the party, and with their party's nominee-to-be, Hillary Clinton.Along the way, Sanders forces didn't merely make their party's leaders squirm. They served notice that, having barged into the party's inner sanctum, they aren't interested in exiting--certainly not exiting quietly.As the day began, they booed their ousted national charwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, at a meeting of her home-state Florida delegation because of newly disclosed emails showing that, under her, the party's apparatus had been eager to help Mrs. Clinton and put down Mr. Sanders. They booed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D. Calif.), long a stalwart of the party's liberal wing, presumably because of her support for Mrs. Clinton.They even booed their hero, Mr. Sanders, at a morning rally when he urged them to unite behind Mrs. ClintonBy the time the convention formally opened just after 4 p.m., the Sanders backers had succeeded in scaring Ms. Wasserman Schultz off the convention stage entirely; she declined to open the convention proceedings as planned, knowing that her appearance would have produced a cascade of boos and catcalls.Yet that victory didn't calm the pro-Sanders camp, at least not entirely. As the convention opened, every time Mrs. Clinton's name was spoken, boos and jeers were heard from the crowd. The testiness between the Sanders and Clinton forces were obvious; after hearing the heckling, Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, the permanent chair of the convention, scolded the audience.""I will be respectful of you and I want you to be respectful of me,"" she said. ""We are all Democrats and we need to act like it."" Similarly, former Denver mayor Wellington Webb, a Clinton supporter, urged the crowd to cheer not one candidate or the other, but to cheer both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton.Hundreds of Sanders supporters streamed into the Pennsylvania Convention Center to hear Mr. Sanders's Monday-afternoon speech, chanting ""Feel the Bern"" as they did so. They were skeptical of Mrs. Clinton's liberal credentials--but even more agitated at the email disclosure that they said showed the party's pro-Clinton bias.""I just feel like if they really were sincere, then the whole party would be standing up and saying this is not acceptable and we don't agree with it,"" said Susan Hall, a delegate for Mr. Sanders from Scranton, Pa. Ms. Hall said that Mr. Sanders had backed Mrs. Clinton for strategic reasons and that she would ""follow his lead""--suggesting the pressure on Mr. Sanders to help line up his supporters behind Mrs. Clinton.Rob Deppert, an alternate delegate from Indiana, wore a green Robin Hood hat handed out by a nurses union seeking to highlight Mr. Sanders's call to tax the rich to benefit the less well-off. Mr. Deppert complained that the emails showed ""basically that the Democratic National Committee had its thumb on the scales and was working with the press to limit Bernie's access,"" producing a ""rigged process.""Meanwhile, out on the streets of Philadelphia, protesters braved temperatures of nearly 100 degrees to support Mr. Sanders. A spirited crowd gathered outside the entrance to the convention, shouting to passing delegates and carrying signs calling for Mr. Sanders to be made the nominee.They chanted, ""Hell no, DNC, we won't vote for Hillary,"" and, ""A vote for Hillary is a vote for Trump."" Others carried signs calling for Mrs. Clinton to be indicted or jailed over her use of email while secretary of state. Police handcuffed a number of demonstrators but didn't arrest them. Instead, the police issued 55 citations for disorderly conduct.""We need Bernie -- we need what he represents to the American people. The American people need the government to represent what it needs,"" said Michelle Gale, a 28-year old who traveled from Chicago to demonstrate. ""We do not want Hillary.""Almost lost in the hubbub was the more substantive impact of the Sanders insurrection--victories his supporters seemed to almost look past. The convention adopted by acclamation the most liberal platform in decades, which moved toward Sanders positions on the minimum wage , trade and college costs .The party also moved to appease the Sanders army's complaints about the structure of party primaries, adopting a plan to reduce the role of so-called superdelegates--party leaders who are automatically made delegates to the party's convention and free to support the candidate of their choice.Mr. Sanders and his supporters complained frequently and vociferously that the superdelegates gave Mrs. Clinton an unfair advantage, though she defeated him in both popular votes and other delegates in the party's primaries and caucuses.""We've won this by standing up,"" says Maine state Rep. Diane Russell, commenting on the Democratic Party's decision to appoint a committee with an eye to overhauling the role of superdelegates. ""We did this. We won this by standing together,"" she shouted, eliciting cheers of ""Bernie, Bernie!""But she closed her remarks by saying she would do everything she could to ensure Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency--a needed boost at a convention with plenty of intraparty divisions.As that suggested, the Sanders insurrection was quieting down, at least temporarily, by the time evening fell, in part because leaders of the Sanders and Clinton campaigns joined forces to calm the atmosphere. Mr. Sanders again made clear to his followers that he wanted them to swing behind the party's nominee.Still, the day showed that the Sanders army isn't interested in disbanding, and may have longer-term ambitions for the party it has rocked.Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comCredit: By Siobhan Hughes and Byron Tau",7/26/16
"Clinton Won the Battle, Sanders the War; Hillary is living in Bernie's party. So she backs free college and a 'public option' while jettisoning trade and charter schools.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806376456?accountid=12768,"Bill Clinton took Democrats to the political middle. He met with Republicans to pass welfare-to-work laws and put more police on the streets. Barack Obama steered the party leftward with ""change we can believe in."" He promised to end long-running wars, deliver an economic recovery, offer medical coverage to the uninsured and unify an increasingly diverse nation.Hillary Clinton will claim the Democratic nomination this week in Philadelphia, but the party is no longer defined by its standard-bearer. The energy rests instead with a rising generation of Democrats excited to use activist government to protect them in anxious economic times.Older Democrats and minority voters provided a ""firewall"" that allowed Mrs. Clinton to defeat her rival in the primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Democrats who call themselves ""somewhat liberal"" went for Hillary by 13 percentage points, according to exit poll data analyzed by Public Opinion Strategies. ""Moderates"" backed her by 23 percentage points. But among the quarter of Democrats who see themselves as ""very liberal,"" she ran even with the socialist.Bernie Sanders and his activist supporters have moved Mrs. Clinton and the party's platform to the left. The result is that the Democrats have taken on an identity that comes from a new base: voters under 40 who have no problem with Mr. Sanders's socialist vision. A 2015 study by the Pew Research Center found that 51% of millennials ""identify as Democrats or lean Democratic,"" compared with only 35% for Republicans. Two-fifths of millennials are people of color and immigrants.This is not your father's--or even your older sister's--Democratic Party. It is far more left-leaning than under Bill Clinton or President Obama.Almost 60% of Democratic voters agree that ""socialism has a positive"" impact on society, according to a February poll by OnMessage Inc. and the American Action Network. In Iowa 43% of Democrats said in January that they would use the word ""socialist"" to describe themselves, a survey by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics found.Forty-seven percent of Democrats told Gallup last year that they are both ""socially liberal and economically moderate/liberal""--the highest level in the poll's history. In 2001 only 30% of Democrats described themselves that way. Between 2000 and 2015 the percentage of ""Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters"" who consider themselves liberal has gone up to 42% from 27%, according to a Pew study in February.Mrs. Clinton has been running to the front of this liberal parade. This month she wrapped her arms around one of Mr. Sanders's biggest causes by backing tuition-free college at in-state public universities for families making under $125,000 a year.She broke with Mr. Obama by calling for repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax on health-insurance plans, a priority for labor unions. She gave a sop to the teachers unions by backtracking on her decades-old support for charter schools. It is clear that in this new liberal order of Democratic politics, the unions will be the enforcers.Mrs. Clinton is now even backing a ""public option""--a Medicare-style government program to compete against private insurance companies. This idea was so radioactive during the debate over the Affordable Care Act that Democrats jettisoned it for fear of being tarred as proponents of socialized medicine.With the implicit support of Mrs. Clinton and her allies, the Sanders coalition added language to the Democratic platform calling to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, put a price on climate-altering emissions like carbon, and abolish the death penalty.The party also stripped out language supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr. Sanders opposed during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton had once praised the deal a ""gold standard,"" but last fall she withdrew her support.""It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,"" Mr. Sanders said this month as he endorsed her in New Hampshire. He correctly noted that the threat of a divided party had forced Mrs. Clinton to accept ""the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.""Mr. Sanders then urged his supporters to keep the pressure on: ""Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency--and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen."" The Vermonter has a stronger hand to play after the success of his populist campaign.Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress have become more liberal--the mirror image of what has happened to the GOP. Democratic incumbents who were defeated during the Obama years were largely centrists from red states: Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska.After the 2012 election, much was written, including by me, about whether the Obama coalition of young people, blacks, Hispanics, gays and single women would keep Democrats in the White House for the near future. No one predicted that first of these core constituencies, young people, would become so vocally liberal.A final factor is the GOP's strategy of unrelenting obstructionism against President Obama, which sparked a low-grade fury among the left wing. This is why Monday night's convention speaker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, gets hundreds of thousands of views every time she posts a fiery speech on YouTube.Senate Republicans have refused to have a hearing, much less a vote, on Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even refused to give Mr. Garland the courtesy of a simple introductory meeting.The result is that the bare-knuckle, activist-driven, take-to-the-streets politics of Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter is becoming the rule among Democrats. This month Senate Democrats blocked Republican efforts to defund so-called sanctuary cities and impose harsh prison sentences on undocumented immigrants.History will record this week's convention as a coming-of-age for a new era of liberal Democratic politics. This is now Bernie Sanders's party: Other Democrats--including Hillary Clinton--are merely living in it.Mr. Williams, a political analyst for Fox News and columnist for the Hill, is the author of ""We the People: The Modern-Day Figures Who Have Reshaped and Affirmed the Founding Fathers' Vision of America"" (Crown. 2016).Related Articles* Why the Democrats Have Turned Left* His and Her Clintonomics* Free College, DudeCredit: By Juan Williams",7/26/16
Clinton in Tight Race In Kentucky; Sanders Wins Oregon,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789404815?accountid=12768,"LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Hillary Clinton held a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders late Tuesday in Kentucky's Democratic presidential primary, a result that blunted the Vermont senator's latest burst of momentum and likely thwarted his hopes of putting together a winning streak in the final state contests.With 99% of precincts reporting, Mrs. Clinton led her Democratic rival by less than 1 percentage point there.She declared victory on Twitter. ""We just won Kentucky!"" she tweeted. ""Thanks to everyone who turned out. We're always stronger united.""Mr. Sanders won the Democratic primary in Oregon, the other state voting Tuesday, and Donald Trump won the Republican primary there. The New York businessman won the Kentucky GOP caucuses on March 5.The decision by Mrs. Clinton to invest both time and resources in Kentucky paid dividends by moving her closer to securing her party's nomination and underscored the virtually impossible task Mr. Sanders faces in trying to chip away at his rival's advantage.Still, Mr. Sanders told supporters in California Tuesday night that his campaign has ""a real shot to win"" several of the remaining Democratic contests. ""We are in until the last ballot is cast,"" he said.While Mrs. Clinton has amassed a nearly insurmountable lead in the Democratic race, she has been lumbering toward the finish line while being forced to simultaneously fend off attacks from Messrs. Sanders and Trump.There were 116 Democratic delegates up for grabs Tuesday, 55 in Kentucky and 61 in Oregon, all of which will be distributed proportionally.Heading into Tuesday's contests, Mrs. Clinton had 2,240 of the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, when both pledged delegates and superdelegates were tallied, leaving her just 143 delegates shy of victory. Mr. Sanders had a combined total of 1,473, which meant the only way he could catch her would be to amass a large number of superdelegates.So far, the Vermont senator has had little luck in persuading those elected officials and party leaders, who are free to back any candidate, to rally behind his candidacy.That challenge likely becomes more difficult now after his supporters, angry over the handling of delegate allocation at a Nevada convention on Saturday, issued death threats to the state's party chairwoman. The messages were so vicious that Nevada officials filed a complaint with the Democratic National Committee.Mr. Sanders in a statement Tuesday condemned ""any and all forms of violence,"" but defended his supporters and railed against the party process for picking a nominee. The Democratic Party ""can open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change -- people who are willing to take on Wall Street, corporate greed and a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. Or the party can choose to maintain its status quo structure,"" he said.In an effort to stall Mr. Sanders's momentum, Mrs. Clinton made three trips to Kentucky, visiting churches, holding small-group discussions, shaking hands at an overflowing diner and headlining a half-dozen rallies. She pitched herself as the best candidate to manage the nation's challenges, including national security and what she characterized as Mr. Trump's ""reckless"" approach to issues.Her campaign spent about $300,000 on TV ads, compared with about $100,000 for the Vermont senator, a Sanders aide said. Clinton aides said that was partly because they saw the state as winnable and partly because ad time in Kentucky is inexpensive. The Clinton campaign's investment in Kentucky marked a change in strategy after she all but ceded Indiana, where Mr. Sanders won by 5 percentage points, and West Virginia, where his margin of victory was almost 16 points.Mr. Sanders spent four days in Kentucky and continued to argue that he would be a stronger general-election candidate and a tougher foe for the New York businessman.""In virtually every national poll and in statewide polls we do better against Donald Trump than Secretary Clinton. We're seeing that all over the country,"" he said during a campaign stop in Kentucky. ""Secretary Clinton does very well with Democrats and so do I, but there are a lot of independents in the country and we do very well with independents,"" he said.Voters in the state reveled at the chance to size up the candidates so late in the primary process. The last contest is June 14 in Washington, D.C., a week after California, New Jersey and other states hold primaries or caucuses.""I really appreciate what she's done for our country and what she will do,"" Mollijean Frazier said of Mrs. Clinton. The retired schoolteacher was among a crush of people greeting Mrs. Clinton at a Paducah diner Monday morning. ""I think Bernie Sanders's people are looking for something that's not going to happen, sort of pie in the sky.""In Louisville, Shea Stephens said she planned to cast a ballot for Mr. Sanders. ""I can't find anything wrong with the man,"" said the 42-year-old technical account manager.Ms. Stephens said Mrs. Clinton ""is the epitome of everything I do not like in politics.""Mrs. Clinton came to Kentucky with some distinct advantages. She easily won the state in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. The state's rules limit participation to registered Democrats, excluding the independent voters who have favored Mr. Sanders all year.Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who campaigned separately for her, won the state twice and remains popular. During her appearances, she repeatedly invoked his economic record and promised to put him to work helping to revive the economy.There was concern, though, in the Clinton camp that the electorate would include conservative Democrats who would cast their ballots against Mrs. Clinton, and therefore for Mr. Sanders. That appeared to be the case last week in West Virginia. She faced other headwinds, including fallout from a comment earlier this year when, in the course of discussing a plan to help coal communities, she predicted that her energy agenda would put a lot of coal miners out of work.---Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Laura Meckler",7/26/16
Election 2016: Nevada Unrest Shows Democratic Rifts --- Sanders rejects charge his backers are prone to violence after state convention dispute,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789404790?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders's feud with the Democratic establishment and front-runner Hillary Clinton continued to boil Tuesday in the wake of an unruly party convention in Nevada, raising new doubts about how easily the party can unite behind its eventual presidential nominee.In the latest turn, the Vermont senator in a statement Tuesday rejected accusations that his supporters were prone to violence and insisted the party must accommodate people fighting for ""real"" change.The comments stood as a clear sign that the Democratic underdog is unwilling to play the role of fence-mender while he battles Mrs. Clinton in the final primaries.At the Nevada state Democratic convention on Saturday in Las Vegas, disputes between supporters of Mr. Sanders and party officials turned physical. After the event, supporters of Mr. Sanders flooded the state party chairwoman with text messages and voice mails -- some containing veiled threats and obscene comments, according to screenshots and voice mails that were compiled by the Nevada Democratic Party.After the convention, the Nevada Democratic Party took the unusual step of filing a complaint about Mr. Sanders and his supporters with the Democratic National Committee, the national arm of the party. In the letter sent Monday, Nevada Democrats said Mr. Sanders's supporters had a ""penchant"" for violence and disruption, warning that the party's national convention in Philadelphia this summer could see similar actions.Mr. Sanders responded in his Tuesday statement that claims of a penchant for violence were ""nonsense."" He added: ""Our campaign of course believes in nonviolent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals.""He said his campaign, too, had faced threats and intimidation, noting gunshots fired at a campaign office in Nevada earlier this year.He added that the party could welcome ""people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change"" or ""choose to maintain its status quo structure.""Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Tuesday that he spoke with Mr. Sanders about the violence in his home state and that he hoped the senator ""will do the right thing.""Later, however, Mr. Reid said he was disappointed by the Sanders statement. ""Bernie is better than that,"" Mr. Reid said.The escalating conflicts demonstrate the deep rifts in the party as the primary process nears an end. Mr. Sanders trails in the convention delegate count but has vowed to keep his campaign going until the July national convention.Heading into Tuesday's contests in Kentucky and Oregon, Mrs. Clinton led by nearly 300 pledged delegates and had the support of more than 500 party officials who serve as ""superdelegates"" and can support any candidate they wish. She is the overwhelming favorite to win the nomination.In Nevada, Mr. Sanders lost the state's popular vote by 5 percentage points in February, but his campaign was hoping to secure additional delegates at the state party convention. Mrs. Clinton's team ultimately prevailed in winning most of the state's delegates.At the convention, Sanders supporters repeatedly shouted down party officials and heckled the featured speaker, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D, Calif.).Afterward, activists directed their displeasure about the outcome at the chairwoman of the state party, Roberta Lange, posting her phone number online and flooding her phone with angry and occasionally threatening messages.In one voice mail shared by the Nevada Democratic Party, a caller says Ms. Lange is a ""corrupt, evil, cynical woman."" Another warns ""the rest of your life is going to be hell.""Another person said: ""I don't know how you can go to sleep in good conscience every night.""Nevada Democrats contacted local law enforcement about some of the text messages and voice mails, a person familiar with the matter said.Credit: By Byron Tau",7/26/16
Bernie Sanders to Serve Senate Term as Independent,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806999305?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Bernie Sanders said he plans to return to the Senate as an independent, despite winning 13 million votes in the Democratic Party's presidential primary contest.""I was elected as an independent; I'll stay two years more as an independent,"" Mr. Sanders said.Speaking at the Bloomberg Politics breakfast on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders also said the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee doesn't go far enough in fixing the situation and that more staff members need to leave following embarrassing disclosures of thousands of internal emails.""We need a DNC which has as very different direction,"" he said. ""I honestly don't know many of the people there. But my guess is we're going to need new leadership, a new direction and new personnel.""Asked after the event whether Mr. Sanders considers himself a Democrat or an independent, a campaign aide said, ""He ran for president as a Democrat but was elected to a six-year term in the Senate as an independent.""Mr. Sanders's appearance followed his prime-time speech Monday in which he urged his supporters to back Hillary Clinton. As for his own future in the party, he said he would remain an independent as he serves out his senate term.Vermont has no party registration. But when Mr. Sanders entered the presidential race last year he proclaimed himself a Democrat.The emails, released by WikiLeaks, appear to show DNC aides plotting ways to undermine Mr. Sanders's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. In some measure they confirm a charge that the Sanders campaign made from the beginning of the primary fight: that Ms. Wasserman Schultz and her staff wanted Mrs. Clinton to prevail.On the eve of the four-day convention devoted to Mrs. Clinton's nomination, Ms. Wasserman Schultz announced she was stepping down as chairwoman. She has played no public role in the convention proceedings.Mr. Sanders cast the DNC as an inept operation that has failed to inspire people to vote, resulting in large Democratic losses in years when the president isn't on the ballot.He said the DNC needs new ""leadership and a new chair that would lead the process of transforming the Democratic Party.""Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic official, has stepped in as interim chairwoman. On Monday, she issued an apology for the emails.She has also made an overture to Mr. Sanders, inviting his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, to lend help to the committee in ""voter participation"" and ""civic engagement.""""I'll help Donna Brazile any way he can,"" Mr. Weaver said in an interview.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",7/27/16
"Democrats Achieve an Uneasy Détente at Convention; Many Bernie Sanders supporters signaled a willingness to support Hillary Clinton, but some walked out",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806950715?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--A fragile détente binding the dueling wings of the Democratic Party held together on Tuesday, quieting many unhappy supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders and allowing Hillary Clinton's team to tamp down the most visible signs of upheaval at this week's convention.But underlying the uneasy peace that emerged from a raucous opening day in Philadelphia were questions about how many Sanders supporters would follow the lead of the Vermont senator, who offered a strong endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in his convention speech on Monday.In many cases, the answers inside the convention hall were different from those on the outside of Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center.Outside the arena, along a median where protesters were corralled, scores of Sanders supporters on Tuesday voiced anger that their candidate's campaign for the nomination had ended, but seemed at loose ends over what to do next.Eric Goodman, a 20-year-old student from Burlington, Vt., was resolute Tuesday in his opposition to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, declaring, ""I am angry at Bernie. I think he betrayed all of his supporters.""Later Tuesday, Sanders supporters expressed their disappointment with Mrs. Clinton's nomination by walking out of the convention hall. A crowd of at least several hundred assembled outside the Wells Fargo Arena. Most sat in the street singing, though a handful threatened to breach the barricades outside the convention center.The U.S. Secret Service said that four people were arrested during Tuesday's demonstrations for attempting to breach the inner perimeter protecting the Wells Fargo arena, where the convention is being held. The Secret Service said they would be charged with attempting to enter a restricted area. Those were the first four arrests of the convention, though more than 50 people were cited on Monday for disorderly conduct.But overall, the signs of disunity on Tuesday were muted.On the convention floor on Monday, many of Mr. Sanders's backers had swallowed their disappointment and signaled a willingness to back Mrs. Clinton in November.The Sanders supporters all had similar complaints: That Mrs. Clinton belonged to a political and financial establishment that wouldn't sufficiently champion workers, and that the Democratic National Committee had rigged the primary system to help her campaign. The question was whether to back Mrs. Clinton or to take another course.To keep the peace on Monday, Clinton and Sanders staffers had teamed up in an urgent scramble to quell protests and smooth intra-party rifts.That afternoon, Sanders officials reached out to the Clinton camp to say tensions were running high over hacked Democratic National Committee emails showing efforts to undercut Mr. Sanders's campaign. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had offered her resignation, but the Vermont senator's delegates still were angry.Clinton and Sanders aides huddled, hatching a plan to limit disruptions on the convention floor. Meantime, Mr. Sanders himself sent a text message to his delegates.""I ask you as a personal courtesy to me to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor,"" he wrote. ""It's of utmost importance you explain this to your delegations --Bernie""The Sanders campaign also sent aides into the aisles of the convention hall to placate unhappy delegates.One Sanders aide went into the California section to talk directly to Sanders delegates, explaining why the protests needed to subside, a person familiar with the matter said.The pitch: Mr. Sanders had come far but fallen short, and Mrs. Clinton had embraced many progressive positions on health care, education and other matters important to the Sanders movement.The Sanders team also talked about the importance of compromise in politics, saying that ""You never get everything you want,"" and the best choice at this moment was Mrs. Clinton, this person said.The Clinton campaign called on one of its high-profile surrogates--former President Bill Clinton--to pitch in with the effort to bridge divisions.Late Monday afternoon, Democratic lawmakers arrived at the arena and were ushered in to a bar, where Mr. Clinton shook hands and took pictures, according to a person familiar with the matter.The reception served a strategic purpose. As Democrats waited to enter, Clinton campaign staffers hovered at the entry point, quietly asking the Democratic lawmakers and officials whether they could help calm tensions on the convention floor if mayhem broke out among the Sanders delegates, the person said.That evening at center stage, convention speakers urged calm and cohesion, prodding Sanders supporters to fall in line.Comedian Sarah Silverman, who had backed the Vermont senator, was blunt. ""To the 'Bernie or bust' people, you're being ridiculous,"" she said.Mr. Sanders himself took a gentler approach, telling his supporters that he understood their disappointment, while making the case for sending Mrs. Clinton to the White House.""He did what he needed to do, but still spoke to the progressive movement that's carrying a lot of us here today and beyond,"" Mina Davis, a Nebraska delegate for Mr. Sanders, said after his speech.The result was a chorus of cheers--with only a smattering of boos--and a declaration of success from both camps.""We ended the night well,"" said John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. ""Are there people who are still grumpy on his side? I have every confidence that there are people who are still grumpy.""For the moment at least, a revolt had been averted. And on the convention floor, Donna Brazile, the incoming interim chairman of the DNC, and Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, were all smiles as they held court.Ms. Brazile said that for the good of the party, she wouldn't cast a ballot during the roll call on Tuesday night. ""It breaks my heart,"" Ms. Brazile said. ""I come from a tradition where the right to vote means everything to me, but I'm going to do it for unity.""Peter Nicholas, Carol E.

"Gov. Andrew Cuomo Faces His Critics at Democratic Convention; Left wing of party knocks governor, even as he praises Sen. Bernie Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806947102?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsProtesters raised criticism on several topics during Mr. Cuomo's second public address Tuesday. An earlier version of this article only mentioned the criticism of his executive order related to a boycott movement against Israel. (July 27, 2016)PHILADELPHIA--Away from his home turf , New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo spent his first day at the Democratic National Convention contending with pockets of the party where he is less than popular.Mr. Cuomo, who four years ago at the convention in Charlotte, N.C., shunned all but a minor address to New York delegates and declined to stay overnight, traveled to Philadelphia to participate more fully this time and has a speaking role later in the week.But on Tuesday he felt the effects of an emboldened Democratic left wing that has been determined to make its voice heard during the convention. Appearing at a breakfast for the New York delegation alongside Bernie Sanders, Mr. Cuomo praised the Vermont senator's presidential campaign and both politicians entered to a standing ovation.""I also want to applaud the senator for keeping his eye on the ball,"" Mr. Cuomo said, to cheers. ""The goal for the Democratic Party is to make sure [Donald] Trump and that philosophy has no place in this country, ever.""But even as Mr. Sanders congratulated Mr. Cuomo for raising the statewide minimum wage and instituting a paid family-leave program, Sanders backers said they have already begun organizing to oppose Mr. Cuomo's re-election bid in 2018.Asked if she was a supporter of the New York governor, Sanders delegate and Queens resident Nancy de Delva said: ""I'm definitely not.""""All of his ideas are more Republican,"" said Ms. de Delva.She said she wasn't appeased by the governor's efforts on progressive ideals such as raising the minimum wage. ""These were not his ideas. Mayor de Blasio wanted all this from the beginning,"" she said.A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo pointed out that the governor had long supported increases to the minimum wage, including before Mr. de Blasio became mayor, and took unilateral actions to raise it for fast-food workers and others prior to this year.Poornima Subramanian, a University of Buffalo pharmacy student, said fellow Sanders delegates have already selected a 2018 candidate: ""We'd like to see [New York Attorney General] Eric Schneiderman run against Andrew Cuomo."" Mr. Schneiderman has said that he doesn't intend to do that.At Mr. Cuomo's other public address of the day, to the Democratic Party's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender caucus, he faced a more receptive crowd. He drew hearty applause for signing legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in New York and for describing the June mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., as ""a terrorist attack on gay Americans.""Still, even among friendly faces, Mr. Cuomo encountered some detractors in the form of protesters who disrupted his speech to criticize him for, among other things, an executive order to force state agencies to divest themselves of companies supporting a Palestinian-backed boycott movement against Israel.Mr. Cuomo recovered quickly from the disruption, and he was soon met with another vocal crowd member with a more supportive message concerning the state's embrace of same-sex marriage rights.Shouted one woman in the audience: ""We did it by having the best governor ever in New York!""Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comWe Want to Hear From YouHave something to say about an article in Greater New York?

Bernie Sanders and allowing Hillary Clinton's team to tamp down the most visible signs of upheaval at this week's convention.But underlying the uneasy peace that emerged from a raucous opening day in Philadelphia were questions about how many Sanders supporters would follow the lead of the Vermont senator, who offered a strong endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in his convention speech on Monday.In many cases, the answers inside the convention hall were different from those on the outside of Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center.Outside the arena, along a median where protesters were corralled, scores of Sanders supporters on Tuesday voiced anger that their candidate's campaign for the nomination had ended, but seemed at loose ends over what to do next.Eric Goodman, a 20-year-old student from Burlington, Vt., was resolute Tuesday in his opposition to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, declaring, ""I am angry at Bernie. I think he betrayed all of his supporters.""On the convention floor, many of Mr. Sanders's backers had swallowed their disappointment and signaled a willingness to back Mrs. Clinton in November.Still, a few dozen Sanders delegates walked out of the convention hall on Tuesday and crossed into the press filing center, where they held a sit-in in full view of the thousand of reporters in the city for the convention. Police shut down the entrance to the press filing room briefly.The Sanders supporters all had similar complaints: That Mrs. Clinton belonged to a political and financial establishment that wouldn't sufficiently champion workers, and that the Democratic National Committee had rigged the primary system to help her campaign. The question was whether to back Mrs. Clinton or to take another course.To keep the peace on Monday, Clinton and Sanders staffers had teamed up in an urgent scramble to quell protests and smooth intra-party rifts.That afternoon, Sanders officials reached out to the Clinton camp to say tensions were running high over hacked Democratic National Committee emails showing efforts to undercut Mr. Sanders's campaign. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had offered her resignation, but the Vermont senator's delegates still were angry.Clinton and Sanders aides huddled, hatching a plan to limit disruptions on the convention floor. Meantime, Mr. Sanders himself sent a text message to his delegates.""I ask you as a personal courtesy to me to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor,"" he wrote. ""It's of utmost importance you explain this to your delegations --Bernie""The Sanders campaign also sent aides into the aisles of the convention hall to placate unhappy delegates.One Sanders aide went into the California section to talk directly to Sanders delegates, explaining why the protests needed to subside, a person familiar with the matter said.The pitch: Mr. Sanders had come far but fallen short, and Mrs. Clinton had embraced many progressive positions on health care, education and other matters important to the Sanders movement.The Sanders team also talked about the importance of compromise in politics, saying that ""You never get everything you want,"" and the best choice at this moment was Mrs. Clinton, this person said.The Clinton campaign called on one of its high-profile surrogates--former President Bill Clinton--to pitch in with the effort to bridge divisions.Late Monday afternoon, Democratic lawmakers arrived at the arena and were ushered in to a bar, where Mr. Clinton shook hands and took pictures, according to a person familiar with the matter.The reception served a strategic purpose. As Democrats waited to enter, Clinton campaign staffers hovered at the entry point, quietly asking the Democratic lawmakers and officials whether they could help calm tensions on the convention floor if mayhem broke out among the Sanders delegates, the person said.That evening at center stage, convention speakers urged calm and cohesion, prodding Sanders supporters to fall in line.Comedian Sarah Silverman, who had backed the Vermont senator, was blunt. ""To the 'Bernie or bust' people, you're being ridiculous,"" she said.Mr. Sanders himself took a gentler approach, telling his supporters that he understood their disappointment, while making the case for sending Mrs. Clinton to the White House.""He did what he needed to do, but still spoke to the progressive movement that's carrying a lot of us here today and beyond,"" Mina Davis, a Nebraska delegate for Mr. Sanders, said after his speech.The result was a chorus of cheers--with only a smattering of boos--and a declaration of success from both camps.""We ended the night well,"" said John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. ""Are there people who are still grumpy on his side? I have every confidence that there are people who are still grumpy.""For the moment at least, a revolt had been averted. And on the convention floor, Donna Brazile, the incoming interim chairman of the DNC, and Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, were all smiles as they held court.Ms. Brazile said that for the good of the party, she wouldn't cast a ballot during the roll call on Tuesday night. ""It breaks my heart,"" Ms. Brazile said. ""I come from a tradition where the right to vote means everything to me, but I'm going to do it for unity.""Peter Nicholas, Carol E.

Formula One Chief's Mother-in-Law Kidnapped in Brazil; Seizure of Bernie Ecclestone's relative at São Paulo home comes less than two weeks before start of Rio Games,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806943057?accountid=12768,"SÃO PAULO--The Brazilian mother-in-law of billionaire Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone was kidnapped on Friday in the country's largest city.A person familiar with the investigation on Tuesday said Aparecida Schunck was kidnapped from her São Paulo home.The kidnappers are asking for 120 million reais ($36.7 million) to free Ms. Schunck, whose daughter Fabiana Flosi married Mr. Ecclestone in 2012, the Brazilian magazine Veja reported.Ms. Flosi, who used to work for Brazil's Formula One championship organization, met Mr. Ecclestone in 2009. They now live in London.Spokespeople for the Brazilian police wouldn't comment on the kidnapping.The kidnapping comes less than two weeks before the Aug. 5 opening of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro amid concerns about street crime and recent terror-related threats, some linked to Islamic State.Kidnappings increased in Brazil and other Latin American countries in the early 2000s, as drug traffickers and criminal gangs used ransom payments to help finance their activities. Brazilian police formed anti-kidnapping units that significantly reduced the problem.Still, kidnappings persist, including instances in which victims are seized for a few hours or days and forced to withdraw money from automated-teller machines.Jason Lee, a jujitsu champion from New Zealand living in Rio de Janeiro, posted to his Twitter account and his Facebook page that he was seized by armed men dressed in police uniforms on Saturday. He said the men threatened him with arrest, forced him into a car, then drove him to two ATMs and told him to withdraw money.On Tuesday, the Rio de Janeiro military police said they have ordered the arrest of two officers suspected of kidnapping Mr. Lee.Credit: By Luciana Magalhaes and Reed Johnson",7/27/16
"For the Bernie Sanders Army, the Fight Isn't Over; At the Democratic convention, the senator's supporters vent their unhappiness",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806547581?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Sen. Bernie Sanders raised an angry army to propel him through this year's presidential primaries. He didn't win that war, but his foot-soldiers showed on Monday they had one more battle they wanted to fight.That fight unfolded here on the first day of the Democratic Party's national convention . Sanders supporters took to the streets, to the hotel ballrooms where state delegations were meeting and ultimately to the floor of the convention itself to vent their unhappiness with the way they say they were treated by the party, and with their party's nominee-to-be, Hillary Clinton.By night's end, the Sanders forces were able to turn from jeering to cheering when Mr. Sanders spoke to the convention and gave a full-throated endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. Still, the day served noticed that, having barged into the party's inner sanctum, they won't exit quietly. Mr. Sanders himself, during his prime-time speech, said his political ""revolution"" would continue.As the day began, they booed their ousted national charwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, at a meeting of her home-state Florida delegation because of newly disclosed emails showing that, under her, the party's apparatus had been eager to help Mrs. Clinton and put down Mr. Sanders. They booed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D. Calif.), long a stalwart of the party's liberal wing, presumably because of her support for Mrs. Clinton.They even booed their hero, Mr. Sanders, at a morning rally when he urged them to unite behind Mrs. Clinton.By the time the convention formally opened just after 4 p.m., the Sanders backers had succeeded in scaring Ms. Wasserman Schultz off the convention stage entirely; she declined to open the convention proceedings as planned, knowing that her appearance would have produced a cascade of boos and catcalls.Yet that victory didn't calm the pro-Sanders camp, at least not entirely. As the convention opened, every time Mrs. Clinton's name was spoken, boos and jeers were heard from the crowd. The testiness between the Sanders and Clinton forces were obvious; after hearing the heckling, Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, the permanent chair of the convention, scolded the audience.""I will be respectful of you and I want you to be respectful of me,"" she said. ""We are all Democrats and we need to act like it."" Similarly, former Denver mayor Wellington Webb, a Clinton supporter, urged the crowd to cheer not one candidate or the other, but to cheer both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton.Hundreds of Sanders supporters streamed into the Pennsylvania Convention Center to hear Mr. Sanders's Monday-afternoon speech, chanting ""Feel the Bern"" as they did so. They were skeptical of Mrs. Clinton's liberal credentials--but even more agitated at the email disclosure that they said showed the party's pro-Clinton bias.""I just feel like if they really were sincere, then the whole party would be standing up and saying this is not acceptable and we don't agree with it,"" said Susan Hall, a delegate for Mr. Sanders from Scranton, Pa. Ms. Hall said that Mr. Sanders had backed Mrs. Clinton for strategic reasons and that she would ""follow his lead""--suggesting the pressure on Mr. Sanders to help line up his supporters behind Mrs. Clinton.Rob Deppert, an alternate delegate from Indiana, wore a green Robin Hood hat handed out by a nurses union seeking to highlight Mr. Sanders's call to tax the rich to benefit the less well-off. Mr. Deppert complained that the emails showed ""basically that the Democratic National Committee had its thumb on the scales and was working with the press to limit Bernie's access,"" producing a ""rigged process.""Meanwhile, out on the streets of Philadelphia, protesters braved temperatures of nearly 100 degrees to support Mr. Sanders. A spirited crowd gathered outside the entrance to the convention, shouting to passing delegates and carrying signs calling for Mr. Sanders to be made the nominee.They chanted, ""Hell no, DNC, we won't vote for Hillary,"" and, ""A vote for Hillary is a vote for Trump."" Others carried signs calling for Mrs. Clinton to be indicted or jailed over her use of email while secretary of state. Police handcuffed a number of demonstrators but didn't arrest them. Instead, the police issued 54 citations for disorderly conduct.""We need Bernie -- we need what he represents to the American people. The American people need the government to represent what it needs,"" said Michelle Gale, a 28-year old who traveled from Chicago to demonstrate. ""We do not want Hillary.""Almost lost in the hubbub was the more substantive impact of the Sanders insurrection--victories his supporters seemed to almost look past. The convention adopted by acclamation the most liberal platform in decades, which moved toward Sanders positions on the minimum wage , trade and college costs .The party also moved to appease the Sanders army's complaints about the structure of party primaries, adopting a plan to reduce the role of so-called superdelegates--party leaders who are automatically made delegates to the party's convention and free to support the candidate of their choice.Mr. Sanders and his supporters complained frequently and vociferously that the superdelegates gave Mrs. Clinton an unfair advantage, though she defeated him in both popular votes and other delegates in the party's primaries and caucuses.""We've won this by standing up,"" says Maine state Rep. Diane Russell, commenting on the Democratic Party's decision to appoint a committee with an eye to overhauling the role of superdelegates. ""We did this. We won this by standing together,"" she shouted, eliciting cheers of ""Bernie, Bernie!""But she closed her remarks by saying she would do everything she could to ensure Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency--a needed boost at a convention with plenty of intraparty divisions.As that suggested, the Sanders insurrection was quieting down, at least temporarily, by the time evening fell, in part because leaders of the Sanders and Clinton campaigns joined forces to calm the atmosphere. Mr. Sanders, even before his speech, again made clear to his followers that he wanted them to swing behind the party's nominee.Still, the day showed that the Sanders army isn't interested in disbanding, and may have longer-term ambitions for the party it has rocked.Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comMore* Emails Show DNC Taking Aim at Sanders* Hack Prompts Allegations of Russian InvolvementCredit: By Siobhan Hughes and Byron Tau",7/27/16
The Democrats' Second Email Problem; Hacked messages showing the party connived against Sanders have sent his fans in Philly into a tizzy.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806538205?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump got a post-convention gift Friday when WikiLeaks released a trove of hacked emails that showed Democratic National Committee leaders conniving against Bernie Sanders.Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz disparaged Mr. Sanders's party loyalty in one email and called his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, a ""damn liar."" The party's CFO, Brad Marshall, suggested trying to make an issue of the Vermonter's religion: ""Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist."" Amy Dacey, the party's CEO, replied: ""AMEN.""It's hardly news that the Democratic machine assisted Hillary Clinton throughout the primary. The party scheduled debates at times likely to draw few viewers--for instance, Sunday night at 9 p.m. Still, it's bracing to see the political cynicism lain out in black and white.The uproar cost Ms. Wasserman Schultz her job, as the chairwoman announced she will step down at the end of the convention. She leaves after having accomplished her mission of nominating Mrs. Clinton, for which she is being rewarded with a titular position as head of the Clinton campaign's ""50-state program"" to elect Democrats nationwide.At first the party establishment expressed remorse only that the improper collusion was exposed. Mr. Marshall, the CFO, apologized Saturday. ""I deeply regret,"" he wrote in a post on Facebook, ""that my insensitive, emotional emails would cause embarrassment to the DNC."" The following day, after Ms. Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation, President Obama lauded her service, saying that ""her fundraising and organizing skills were matched only by her passion, her commitment and her warmth."" Mrs. Clinton thanked her ""longtime friend"" for ""getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention.""Meantime, Team Clinton is using Russian hackers as a diversion. ""Sources are saying the Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump,"" campaign manager Robby Mook said. Campaign Chairman John Podesta sensed ""a kind of bromance going on between Putin and Trump, which is distinct from this leak.""The truth is that the entire party establishment opposed Mr. Sanders. Last fall President Obama tamped down on the furor over Mrs. Clinton's email indiscretions by saying that ""I don't think it posed a national security problem."" More than 600 of the party's 712 ""superdelegates"" backed Mrs. Clinton, even as most polls showed Mr. Sanders performing better against Republicans in November.On Saturday the rules committee for this week's Philadelphia convention attempted to mollify Sanders supporters: A majority of the committee voted to establish a postelection commission to consider reducing the role of superdelegates. This was intended to avert a floor fight on an amendment altogether eliminating superdelegates, which would have likely bled into a recital of party grievances.Yet the sop did not placate disaffected Sanders voters, who view the episode as a symbol of the ""rigged"" political system. Thousands of protesters stormed the city's center on Monday, demanding that the party ""nominate Sanders or lose in November!"" Mr. Sanders's exhortations to back Mrs. Clinton were greeted with boos.After getting jeered by her home-state delegation Monday morning, Ms. Wasserman Schultz was removed from the schedule of speakers. Late afternoon, the DNC finally apologized for ""inexcusable remarks made over email,"" saying it ""does not--and will not--tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates."" Democratic Party leaders are now rushing to tame the liberal furies they fanned for so many years.They worry that Sanders voters--particularly working-class whites--are not tethered to the party. The WikiLeaks flap provides Mr. Trump an opening to preach that they've been cheated. The question is whether he is capable of exploiting Democrats' imbroglio without shooting himself in the foot.Credit: By Allysia Finley",7/27/16
Election 2016: Democrats Fear Unruly Convention --- Sanders backers seek at least five permits to demonstrate in Philadelphia in July,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789697542?accountid=12768,"A growing number of Democrats are bracing for a divisive July presidential convention in Philadelphia that could damage the party and expected nominee Hillary Clinton.A loose coalition of supporters of rival Sen. Bernie Sanders is using social media to plan a series of events at the Democratic National Convention. Using pro-Sanders blogs and websites, organizers will be pressing to insert his progressive agenda -- from free college tuition to revisions in the primary process -- into the party's platform.At least five of the nine permit applications to hold demonstrations during the four-day event have been filed by pro-Sanders forces with the Philadelphia city government, according to the mayor's office. The groups planning the events are named The Berners, Black Men for Bernie, Movement for Bernie and Bernie-or-Bust. No applications have been filed yet by supporters of Mrs. Clinton.Cleveland, the site of the Republican National Convention, which was once expected to be a disruptive event, reported receiving six permit applications as of early May -- none indicating that they are in support of any former Republican candidates.""I really wouldn't call it a protest. It's a political revolution,"" said Bill Taylor, a 30-year-old Philadelphia resident and Sanders campaign volunteer who is helping organize the demonstrations. ""There is no stopping the movement that Bernie has created. This isn't about one man.""The prospective protests could undermine efforts by the party to unite its wings for the fall fight against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, and overshadow the fact that Mrs. Clinton's is the first female nominee of a major U.S. political party.Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump inched closer to clinching their respective nominations on Tuesday, as the former secretary of state declared victory in the Kentucky primary and Mr. Trump rolled up a win in Oregon. Mr. Sanders won the Oregon Democratic primary, though he has almost no chance of catching Mrs. Clinton in the race for the 2,383 delegates needed to win.Doug Schoen, a polling expert who has advised former President Bill Clinton, said the divisions within the party ""appear to be widening, not narrowing, in ways that could be calamitous, particularly if there is ongoing chaos at the Democratic convention.""The animus between Mr. Sanders and some party leaders boiled over into public view on Saturday, when his backers, angry over the delegate allocation at a Nevada convention that favored Mrs. Clinton, began shouting, throwing chairs and issuing death threats to the state party chairwoman. Mrs. Clinton won the Feb. 20 Nevada caucuses.While party leaders urged Mr. Sanders to act as a calming influence, he inflamed tensions by issuing a complicated statement that condemned violence, justified his supporters' frustrations and railed against the party's process for selecting a nominee.During a California rally Tuesday night, he delivered a message to Democratic leaders, urging them to ""do the right thing"" and welcome into the fold people who are prepared to fight for the economic and social change proposals in his platform.Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said on CNN she deemed Mr. Sanders's response unacceptable.By Wednesday, many Democrats appeared eager to move on from the kerfuffle. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called for unity, while adding that harassment and intimidation were unacceptable in the primary process.""We are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose -- to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trump's hands,"" Mr. Mook said.But the Sanders team refused to relent. Asked on MSNBC if the campaign regretted the tone of its initial remarks, campaign manager John Weaver said: ""No, I don't, as a matter of fact.""Protest organizers say their goal will be to prod the party to make long-term changes to the way it nominates candidates, such as curbing or eliminating the influence of superdelegates -- who include many Democratic officeholders.A senior aide to the Sanders campaign said it had little control over what his most ardent supporters might do.California Sen. Dianne Feinstein expressed concerns about the convention, saying that Mr. Sanders should have sent a full-throated message to his supporters what happened in Nevada wouldn't be tolerated.""I don't want to go back to the '68 convention,"" she told CNN, referring to the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago. ""I worry about what it does to the electorate as a whole, and he should, too.""While relatively few Democratic officials came to Mr. Sanders's defense in the wake of the Nevada convention, Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.) said that Mr. Sanders had responded appropriately.---Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.Credit: By Byron Tau and Colleen McCain Nelson",7/27/16
Trump and Bernie: Less Is More,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789696545?accountid=12768,"If you did a word-association game with people for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it might go like this:Donald Trump: wall, trade, terrific.Bernie Sanders: billionaires, Wall Street, income inequality.With these words, Donald Trump, the host of ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" defeated a platoon of professional Republican politicians and is the party's presumptive nominee.Bernie Sanders, a Vermont socialist, won't be the Democrats' nominee but he has transformed Hillary Clinton into the incredible shrinking heir apparent.As a result, some have asked: What is going on with the American electorate? A follow-up question would be: How have Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders gone so far by offering so little?Everyone gets that these two campaigns are about varieties of anger. But something other than anger is changing America's politics.At the Trump campaign website, five policy positions are listed. Two are ""Pay for the Wall"" and ""Immigration."" Other than trade with China, there is no entry on foreign policy.Sen. Sanders's campaign is essentially variations on several evocative phrases. Liberal analysts have debunked what little detail he has proposed as implausible, notably on health care.And still: political minimalism is a winner in 2016.After meeting with Mr. Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan said, ""Going forward, we're going to go a little deeper in the policy weeds.""But Donald Trump probably thinks weeds are something he hires a gardener to do. Mr. Trump himself said last summer that the details would come ""over the next two or three weeks -- probably sometime during September. OK?"" They didn't come.Could it be that these two have read the electorate's zeitgeist correctly? They, especially Mr. Trump, understand that the vapors shaping public sentiment -- and ""sentiment"" is the word -- have shifted decisively away from a past built, for the most part, on substance and logic.My apologies to the Trump and Sanders supporters who have their support analyzed out to the third decimal point. But not everyone does, nor wants to anymore.Professional politics itself has been transitioning toward more emotive metrics. The most important candidate tests now are ""cares about people like me"" or ""tells it like it is.""All of Mr. Trump's main opponents -- Messrs. Bush, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich -- were policy wonks. For them, what mattered was hands-on political experience. But the kind of experience in vogue now is more like the elation from attending a mass rally.The Trump-Sanders policy pitch resembles a Rorschach test. They let voters read meanings of their own into immigration, make America great again and the billionaire class. Their rhetoric-only campaigns flip the switch for the already wired.Hillary has tried to be a more rational alternative to Bernie the way all the Republican candidates did with Donald Trump. She's getting hurt for the same reason: At least half the electorate this year isn't into hearing how much she knows about policy.Mrs. Clinton's campaign said this week she planned to call out Mr. Trump on his lack of detail and his contradictions. She might want to consult Aristophanes' ancient Greek comedy ""The Clouds,"" a satire of politicians who overthink.This isn't quite the death of reason, though Stanford's Russ Roberts noted in these pages recently how economists increasingly factor feelings about politics into objective data.How did this happen? My lodestar on these matters is Marshall McLuhan, who wrote presciently in 1967: ""All media works us over completely."" It would be foolish not to recognize that the environment we swim in daily alters everything, not least politics.In the digital world enveloping us now, all you have to know is how to work the interface. Click, and software does the heavy thinking and detail work. Messrs. Trump and Sanders are more in sync with the culture many are most comfortable with.A typical Trump conversation makes minimal linear sense. But most big superhero movies today make no sense either. They're just a lot of quick spurts, jumbled points of view and over-the-top caricatures. Like Donald Trump.Ever notice that quick, ironic Trumpian smile amid his rants? He knows his audience -- half serious, half hoot. It works. At the Nevada caucuses last weekend, the Sanders supporters swung from glee to violence. ""Feel the Bern"" is a sensation.The Trump and Sanders phenomena really have more in common with Facebook communities than with the two political parties. Maybe that's the future. Criticizing them, we've all learned, violates the social bond.There have to be professional Democrats who wish they could roll Bernie's new magic voter dice against Donald Trump's this fall.Of course we can't govern this way. The Trump and Sanders electorates are right in their anger about poor wage growth, but it's still going to be a mistake if the next president, elevated out of a culture of sentiment, is incapable of policy execution.This is a presidential campaign for our time. What comes after, the world and its many realities, will still be old school.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",7/27/16
Election 2016: Clinton Fights for a Win in Kentucky --- The Democrat looks to snap Sander's streak while keeping an eye on Republican Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789005959?accountid=12768,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Democrat Hillary Clinton made a final push in Kentucky ahead of Tuesday's presidential primary, looking to snap a losing streak against Sen. Bernie Sanders while battling a second front against Republican Donald Trump.After all but conceding the past couple contests, Mrs. Clinton mounted a real campaign here. By Tuesday she is scheduled to have appeared at 11 events over three trips, including her visits to a pair of African-American churches Sunday morning. Her campaign also was on the air with TV ads.Mr. Sanders also campaigned this weekend in Kentucky, hoping to build on back-to-back wins in Indiana and West Virginia. Both campaigns said Kentucky was more competitive than Tuesday's other contest, in Oregon, where Mr. Sanders is favored.A two-state defeat might not meaningfully change Mrs. Clinton's delegate advantage, but it would be embarrassing for her to continue losing states and further proof that a substantial slice of Democrats aren't satisfied with her as the nominee and are drawn to Mr. Sanders's more populist message.It also would put off the day when Democrats can begin uniting around one nominee, as some in the fractured Republican Party are trying to do around Mr. Trump.On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton's double-edge challenge was on display. At a rally at a union training facility, she hit Mr. Trump for his ""reckless"" and ""scary, dangerous"" approach to national security. She said his comments on the economy, such as his suggestion that wages are too high, are ""just frightening."" A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't respond to a request for comment.She also revived a hit on Mr. Sanders's vote in 2009 against bailout funds for the U.S. auto industry. Pointing to the industry's revival, she said, ""I think I came out on the better side of that.""Mr. Sanders has said he voted against the legislation because it also included a bailout of Wall Street firms that he opposed.For his part, Mr. Sanders emphasized his better showing in polling of hypothetical matchups against Mr. Trump in an appeal to superdelegates -- party leaders who can support whomever they like for the nomination. So far it hasn't worked to win them over.""In virtually every national poll and in statewide polls, we do better against Donald Trump than Secretary Clinton. We're seeing that all over the country,"" he said in Paducah, Ky., where Mrs. Clinton planned to campaign on Monday.The Vermont senator is likely too far behind in the delegate race to win the nomination, even if he continues winning states, but he is continuing to vigorously challenge Mrs. Clinton. In Kentucky, 55 delegates are stake, and they will be awarded proportionately, meaning in a close contest they would be roughly divided.The Clinton campaign has written off Oregon as unwinnable but opted to compete for Kentucky, a state she easily won in 2008. After spending nothing on TV ads in Indiana or West Virginia, the Clinton camp bought about $300,000 worth in Kentucky, about three times what Mr. Sanders bought, according to a Sanders adviser.""We're spending where we believe we can have an impact,"" said Joel Benenson, a senior Clinton strategist.Mr. Sanders has spent a total of four days in Kentucky, including rallies, stops at field offices and an impromptu photo op Saturday with teenagers headed to their prom.The state limits the Democratic primary to registered Democrats, a rule that typically favors Mrs. Clinton. Still, there is some concern in the Clinton campaign that the electorate will include conservative Democrats who will cast their ballots against Mrs. Clinton, and therefore for Mr. Sanders.Mrs. Clinton faces fallout from a comment earlier this year when, in the course of discussing a plan to help coal communities, she predicted that her energy agenda would put a lot of coal miners out of work. Miners angry about those comments protested a Bill Clinton rally last week, booing as he took the stage.She appealed to miners and their families at a rally in Fort Mitchell in northern Kentucky on Sunday, saying ""we must not walk away from them"" as the nation transitions to cleaner sources of energy.""We lost 120,000 miners in the 20th century. Think about that. [They] went down in those mines, generation after generation, lots of them got black lung [disease],"" she said. ""But they made it possible for us to industrialize, to turn on the lights, to power our factories.""Credit: By Laura Meckler",7/27/16
Hillary Clinton Officially Becomes First Woman to Win Major Party Nomination; Bill Clinton gives personal account of wife's life in public service after Bernie Sanders moves to formally nominate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806944805?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Hillary Clinton became the first female presidential nominee of any major party on Tuesday, a historic milestone that sets the stage for a battle to prove to voters that she is someone they can trust in the White House.The second day of the Democratic National Convention was designed to offer reassurance to an electorate that has watched her on the national stage for more than two decades as first lady, then U.S. senator and secretary of state.The validators tapped to send that message ranged from her vanquished primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, to her husband, former President Bill Clinton.Late in the evening, Mrs. Clinton briefly addressed the convention via a video feed, appearing after an animated pane of glass shattered. ""I can't believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet,"" she said to cheers.Mrs. Clinton, who was defeated by Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic nomination, proved to be a resilient campaigner in her second presidential bid, yet she also displayed campaign vulnerabilities that Republicans will look to exploit.Chief among them are likability and trust. Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling has shown that both Mrs. Clinton and her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, are disliked by more voters than any nominee in the past quarter-century.Asked why many voters distrust her, Mrs. Clinton has often said Republicans have sought to demonize her and subjected her to unfounded attacks. But she hasn't always helped her own cause. For months, she defended her use of a private email account and server during her tenure at the State Department. FBI Director James Comey criticized her email arrangement as ""extremely careless,"" but said he wouldn't recommend the Justice Department pursue criminal charges.Polls showed voters haven't bought her explanations, and Mrs. Clinton later said the move was a mistake and vowed not to repeat it.Reversing voters' negative sentiment fell to one of the party's most persuasive speakers. Mr. Clinton highlighted Mrs. Clinton's skill as an agent of change, recalling her work in Arkansas developing preschool programs and her efforts to overhaul the health-care system early in his presidency.""She's insatiably curious, she's a natural leader, she's a good organizer, and she's the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life,"" he said.Mr. Clinton added: ""Some people say, well, we need change, she's been around a long time. She sure has, and she's sure been worth every single year she's put into making people's lives better.""And describing her activism as a young law student, he said: ""Hillary opened my eyes to a whole new world of public service by a private citizen.""He ran through a narrative of their lives together, from the multiple times she rejected his marriage proposals to dropping daughter Chelsea off at college, during which Mrs. Clinton obsessed about installing paper liners in her daughter's dresser drawers.Referring to last week's Republican National Convention, in which most speakers attacked his wife and the delegates chanted ""lock her up,"" Mr. Clinton called their depictions a ""cartoon"" version of Mrs. Clinton that the Republicans made up because the ""real"" one is too tough to beat.""Life in the real world is complicated, and change is hard,"" he said.Other speakers reinforced Mr. Clinton's message, including former President Jimmy Carter, former Attorney General Eric Holder and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.The evening also featured speakers who talked about her lower-profile efforts to help people coping with illness, loss and tragedy, and the mothers of seven black men killed in high-profile cases that sparked community outrage.Mr. Sanders nominated Mrs. Clinton, sparking roars of approval from the crowd, a sign that the deep divisions that ran through the delegation just a day earlier were being smoothed over.The Clinton campaign gave Mr. Sanders three nominating speeches for his candidacy, a roll call that counted his votes, and a moment that paid homage to his remarkable, insurgent candidacy. But a group of several dozen Sanders supporters left the convention floor after the roll call vote and conducted a sit-in in the media filing center.Noman Khanani, a Sanders delegate from Massachusetts, said Mr. Clinton's more personal portrait could help bring skeptics into the fold--but only within limits. ""I'm still bitter but we're supporting party unity,"" he said. ""Bill's speech did a good job to humanize Hillary and win back that trust.""A question facing the Clinton campaign is whether she can reshape public perceptions at a high-stakes moment late in her political career.As far back as the early 1990s, when Mrs. Clinton first appeared on the national stage, her advisers worried that she was seen as a tough, partisan figure. Pollsters wrote a memo to Mr. Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992 laying out ways to ""reduce voters' discomfort with Hillary.""""She knows she has work to do to earn people's trust,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior Clinton adviser.Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comMore on Election 2016* Convention Tackles Issues of Violence and Police* Kaine Runs Left on Social Issues* Obama to Play Central Role* Obama Says Experts Tie Russia to DNC Hacking* For Some Women, Gender Isn't Enough* Economic Messages Reveal Tensions* Democrats Achieve an Uneasy Détente at Convention* Clinton Committed to 'New Approach' on Trade Deal, Podesta Says* 2016 Election: Polls, Calendar, Money and MoreAttend in Person* Join Gerard Baker and Gerald F.

"Trump, Sanders and the Populist Anti-Policy Surge",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789939870?accountid=12768,"If there's one thing that unites the populist campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it's a desire to put the ""public"" back into ""public policy."" Many Americans apparently feel that policy is something done to them, rather than with them. They disdain the unknown ""experts"" in distant Washington, D.C., who devise everything from trade deals to overtime rules.As the dean of a graduate school in public policy, I've been thinking: Are programs like mine partly responsible for this state of affairs? How should graduates in the Class of 2016 react as they enter a world increasingly skeptical of their expertise?It's true that government has often failed to engage citizens. During a recent conference on land use at Pepperdine, the planning director of a large California city explained it this way: ""The problem is that we always put people up in front of the public who are the least prepared to be there.""Her staff were experts in the technical aspects of their work -- from limits on building heights to requirements for setbacks. But she recognized that when her planners met with citizens, who often had different priorities, they were incapable of facilitating productive dialogue. The public simply concluded that the government couldn't -- or wouldn't -- ""listen.""Graduate programs in public policy and public administration have wrestled with this for years. The discipline sends into the field alumni who may be very good at formulating something called ""policy,"" but not so good at understanding the public's role in its creation. ""Large segments of mainstream public administration scholarship,"" Robert F. Durant and Susannah Bruns Ali wrote three years ago in Public Administration Review, ""privilege bureaucratic expertise and marginalize the deliberative role of unorganized interests and citizens in agency deliberations.""The general tendencies of these academic programs toward quantitative knowledge and standardized solutions has created what we see today: from local planners who don't listen, to White House advisers who believe that ObamaCare passed because of the ""stupidity of the American voter.""At Pepperdine, we host a training series titled ""Public Engagement: The Vital Leadership Skill."" More than 1,000 public officials have taken part, learning the basics of facilitating input from citizens. We developed the program about five years ago after realizing that many midcareer public leaders never learned these skills in college and graduate school.Are this generation's successors being taught them? The retirement of the baby boomers will effect one of the greatest changes in public leadership in American history. Now is the time to update these programs to ensure that generational change becomes cultural change.First, we should teach students to think of the public not as a faceless mass, but as actual, individual human beings. ""Modern public administration,"" the great sociologist Robert Nisbet wrote, ""has been generally dominated by the nineteenth-century rationalist's conception of society as a vast aggregate of unconnected political particles."" That was in 1953.Public-policy programs should integrate essential quantitative coursework into a liberal-arts approach. Students should read what the Great Books say about the role of a citizen in a democracy, while studying what the latest social-psychology research shows about the myriad biases people bring to ""fact based"" decision-making. These will help them see that the policy they develop for Rome, Ga., may not work in Rome, N.Y., (or Rome, Italy, for that matter) and that some government services might be better provided by a local nonprofit or through collaboration with the private sector.Second, schools must teach a set of skills -- how to facilitate public meetings or publicize them to increase participation. The ""public comment"" process by which local boards and councils usually involve citizens does not succeed at informing either the public or policy makers. In 2013 Pepperdine, working with the League of California Cities, surveyed over 900 public officials. Seventy-six percent said that their public meetings were ""typically dominated by people with narrow agendas.""It's the same phenomenon that played out in the conflagrations known as town halls when ObamaCare was being passed. Citizens came out in force against the bill, but Congress passed it anyway. Some argue that these failed public meetings led to the creation of America's last populist movement: the tea party.Finally, students of public policy should be taught about the role of technology in mediating the relationship between the citizen and his government. A couple of months ago, my hometown of Santa Monica invited me via Facebook to complete an online survey regarding a downtown building project. Tomorrow's public leaders must be prepared to involve and inform residents in ways the private sector has employed for decades -- engaging them on social media, or posting budget data online to increase transparency.In the months ahead, thousands of future leaders will be awarded degrees in public policy. Meanwhile, graduate schools should ponder the role they play in American democracy -- and how they can respond to the populist moment that is upending politics (and policy) as usual.---Mr. Peterson is the dean of the Pepperdine School of Public Policy.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Populist Anti-Policy Surge Has Deep Roots"" -- WSJ May 26, 2016)Credit: By Pete Peterson",7/28/16
A Goal for Bus Ride Home: Healing Democratic Convention Rifts; Many Sanders delegates and volunteers say they will need time to mend their hurt feelings,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807434206?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--The bus ride from Dayton, Ohio, was full of jokes and laughter, with the Democrats heading to the national convention paying little attention to who supported Hillary Clinton and who backed Bernie Sanders.But the eight-hour bus ride back to southwest Ohio will be an exercise in the most personal aspect of party reunification--mending hurt feelings. Sanders supporters didn't expect to come to the City of Brotherly Love to learn their hero was giving up his fight for the presidency. Clinton delegates say it is time to move on.In the convention hall, on Philadelphia's Septa public transportation system and on the streets, heated arguments have broken out among Clinton backers and ""Bernie or Bust"" Sanders supporters. In the near term, efforts at reconciliation will mix with regret about money spent and ambivalence about crowded rooming conditions.""Each night we've been drawing closer together, but it takes time,"" said Deloris Rome Hudson, a retired schoolteacher from Eaton, Ohio, who backs Mrs. Clinton.Ms. Rome Hudson's seatmates in the Wells Fargo Center Monday night turned beet-red and wept as Mr. Sanders announced that he would support Mrs. Clinton. The next evening, Ms. Rome Hudson returned to her seat expecting a thaw after both sides went home to pray on it. ""When I got there,"" she said, ""they sat somewhere else.""Some Sanders supporters have arrived at the acceptance stage of grief, now taking pride in the role they played in pushing the party to the left on trade and issues of income inequality.""We certainly are acknowledging feelings,"" said Morgan Johnson, a 21-year-old Ohio State University student and state director of College Students for Bernie. She split a hotel room with four others to keep costs down, sharing double beds and taking turns in a single shower.Debra Massey-Norton, a Sanders supporter who lives in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, must face the 87 people who helped fund her trip to the convention, many of whom back Mr. Sanders. ""Some of them gave $5 at a time to say, 'Please make my voice heard,' "" she said. ""It's going to take time.""One reason reconciliation will be hard is that even small things are triggers for bad feelings. Calvin Gilliland, a CNN intern, was returning home on the subway after he finished his shift covering the convention. Noticing that a woman's Sanders button had fallen off and rolled under the seat, Mr. Gilliland said ""Ma'am, I think you lost your button."" Noticing his CNN T-shirt, she replied, ""You helped us lose our democracy.""Tristan Rader, a 30-year-old from Cleveland who supports Mr. Sanders, has worked through his feelings and already has a plan: attend a Democratic Socialists of America meeting. ""They told everybody, listen: if you don't live in a swing state, do what you want,"" he said. ""If you live in Ohio, Virginia, Florida, vote for Hillary. And the next day, we're going to organize to defeat Hillary [in 2020].""Credit: By Siobhan Hughes",7/29/16

Two suspects were arrested and police were still searching for other possible participants.Additional details of the operation weren't immediately available.The high-profile kidnapping had underscored Brazil's crime issues ahead of the Aug. 5 opening of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.Local daily O Estado de S. Paulo reported that Ms. Schunck's captors had asked for [euro]168 million to free Ms. Schunck, whose daughter, Fabiana Flosi, married Mr. Ecclestone in 2012. The couple now resides in London.The police spokesman declined to confirm the amount of the ransom but said nothing was paid. Ms. Schunck was found in good health.Ms. Schunck's family couldn't immediately be reached for comment.Kidnappings were common in Brazil and other Latin American countries in the early 2000s as criminal gangs used ransom payments to help finance their activities. Brazilian police formed anti-kidnapping units that significantly reduced the problem.Still, the crime persists, including instances in which victims are seized for a few hours or days and forced to withdraw money from automated-teller machines.Write to Rogerio Jelmayer at rogerio.jelmayer@wsj.comCredit: By Rogerio Jelmayer",8/1/16
Election 2016: Feud Between Sanders And DNC Head Escalates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790309391?accountid=12768,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders escalated his feud Sunday with Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, endorsing her primary challenger and saying she would lose her leadership role if he became president.Mr. Sanders, who has often spoken of political revolution and bristled at Democratic Party procedures, has long had an uneasy relationship with Ms. Wasserman Schultz.Ms. Wasserman Schultz is a U.S. House member from South Florida. Mr. Sanders said on CNN that he supports her primary challenger, law professor and activist Tim Canova. ""Clearly I favor her opponent,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""His views are much closer to mine than to Wasserman Schultz's.""The Sanders campaign also sent a fundraising message urging his supporters to split a contribution between his campaign and Mr. Canova's.Ms. Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that her constituents know how hard she fights for them. ""Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary,"" she said.Mr. Sanders also said he wouldn't reappoint Ms. Wasserman Schultz if he becomes president. He said on CBS that he likes her personally but added, ""Do I think she is the kind of chair the Democratic Party needs? I don't.""Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, in her own appearance on NBC, said Mr. Sanders hadn't been thoroughly tested in the primaries, and that this affected his chances of defeating presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. ""I don't think he's had a single negative ad ever run against him, and that's fine,"" Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Sanders. ""But we know what we're going into, and we understand what it's going to take to win in the fall.""Mr. Canova served on an advisory board Mr. Sanders established in 2011 on reforming the Federal Reserve. One of his campaign positions takes aim at ""the rigged economic and political systems that put Wall Street and multinational corporations first while leaving ordinary Americans behind,"" language similar to that used by Mr. Sanders.Before the current campaign, Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, spent his political career as an independent rather than a Democrat.A low-level conflict between the Sanders camp and Ms. Wasserman Schultz began early in his candidacy. His supporters argued the party was holding too few debates, and that this helped Mrs. Clinton, with her greater name recognition.Mr. Sanders also complains regularly that so many of the Democratic state primaries have been closed, meaning only registered Democrats can participate; he has done better when independents and Republicans can also vote. And he's criticized the notion of superdelegates, high-ranking Democratic Party officials who help choose the nominee.Ms. Wasserman Schultz, for her part, voiced concern about events at the recent Nevada Democratic state convention, where Sanders supporters became unruly and reportedly threatened the state party chairwoman.Credit: By Naftali Bendavid and Damian Paletta",8/1/16
Bernie and the Cut-the-Military Brigade,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790308075?accountid=12768,"The U.S. Marine Corps recently revealed that 70% of its F/A-18 jet fighters aren't flight-worthy. For years military leaders have warned that their budgets are insufficient. But when they request increases, the anti-defense crowd claims military spending is more than adequate, citing comparisons with other nations or previous eras. These arguments are specious.Bernie Sanders says the U.S. spends more on defense than the ""next nine countries combined."" The correct number is actually six, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Last year Washington spent $596 billion. No. 2 was China at $215 billion. No. 3 was Russia at $91 billion. You might hear lower numbers -- $145 billion for Beijing and $66 billion for Moscow -- but these are misleading. China's official figures don't include several spending categories, such as arms imports. The lower Russian number is its 2015 budget at 2015's exchange rate. That rate plummeted in 2014, but Russia pays for its military in rubles so the 2014 rate better represents the country's military funding.Therefore, in 2015 the U.S. spent a little under twice what its two ""near-peer"" adversaries spent. That might be plenty, if China and Russia were America's only national-security threats and located nearby. But the U.S. is also fighting jihadists with thousands of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and with dozens of drones and special-operations teams throughout the Middle East -- while also contending with Iran and North Korea.Another tactic of the anti-defense crowd is to emphasize the 41% growth in military spending since 9/11. The fact is 2001's spending, as a percentage of GDP, was at a historically low 2.9%, compared with 34.5% during World War II, 11.7% during the Korean War, 8.9% during Vietnam and 6% during the Reagan presidency. Even at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, defense spending reached only 4.7%. In 2015 it was back down to 3.3%.U.S. defense spending has grown 41% since Sept. 10, 2001. But in that time Russia and China have increased spending by 267% and terrorists brought down the World Trade Center. Perhaps 41% isn't enough. A little-noted fact: The 2015 budget was $120 billion less than planned. In 2010 the Defense Department projected the 2015 base budget -- the portion that doesn't cover current wars -- at $616 billion. Instead, it was $496 billion. Had the 2010 plan held, defense spending would have been 4% of GDP last year.But isn't defense spending driving the budget deficit? Not really. Defense as a percentage of federal spending is also at a post-World War II low. It accounted for 16% in 2015, 25% under Reagan, 50% under Eisenhower and over 80% during World War II. The projection for 2017 is 14.9%.Despite what Mr. Sanders and the anti-defense brigade would have you believe, America is getting its security -- in an increasingly insecure world -- at record low cost.---Mr. Katz is the director for defense analysis at Aviation Week Intelligence and Data Services.

Declarations: Clinton-Sanders: Maybe That's the Ticket,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790317520?accountid=12768,"Let's begin with a prophecy: It is not only the Republican Party that is breaking and perhaps re-forming. The Democratic Party is also starting to come apart. We're seeing the first signs of it now.A significant part of the base is going left. Bernie Sanders took off because they want a socialist. The party is going left for a host of reasons: the crash of 2008, economic strain, eight years of President Obama, trends within American culture and education. Hillary Clinton's struggles this year are connected in part to her ideological unreliability, to the sense that she's a generation behind ideologically, that she's got the wrong attitude toward Wall Street and the use of military power. She's old school; we're entering something new.Here's what I suspect is coming whatever happens this year. Just as a portion of Republicans -- nobody knows how big -- will break from the GOP over Donald Trump, some percentage of Democrats, especially among the affluent, will, in the next cycle, start to peel off from their party over its lurch leftward. They will not be at home in a party of smiley-face socialism that threatens to become actual socialism. They will not want the American economy destroyed. They will not be comfortable in a party that supports the most extreme political correctness; they do not want their 10-year-old daughters using transgendered bathrooms with men. They will find themselves increasingly opposed to the political correctness that has swept the universities. They will have increasing qualms about spending $60,000 a year to have their bright, kind children turned into leftist robots.So they will start to split off from the Democrats, and they will find the Republicans who split off in 2016, and together, in 2020 or so, they will attempt to create their own party. It will be pro-growth, moderate on social issues, more or less neoconservative in its foreign policy. It will be smallish but well-heeled. It will try to hold together and grow.That is my prophecy. Everything is in play.I mentioned the strains, shifts and breakage within the Democratic Party that you can see right now. Nothing illustrated it like what happened last Saturday in Las Vegas, when a state Democratic Party convention turned violent, with chairs thrown, fists shaken, curses screamed. Sen. Barbara Boxer, longtime California liberal and Clinton supporter, was heckled and booed. She later said she'd feared for her safety. The state Democratic chairwoman reported threats of bodily harm, including a text message that said: ""We know where you live . . . Where your kids go to school/grandkids. We have everything on you.""It doesn't get much uglier than that. At issue, procedures surrounding the delegate-selection process and Sanders supporters' claim that the deck was stacked against them. This was the local expression of a larger national argument over whether the Democratic National Committee and its chairman, Hillary friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz, were, as Donald Trump used to say, rigging the system.After the Vegas melee Mr. Sanders was relatively unrepentant. He blandly said a few days later that he opposes all forms of violence. He told a California rally that the Democratic Party ""can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real social and economic change.""The Democratic divide can be seen in other ways. Dante Chinni of this newspaper took a dive into the demographics of Kentucky, whose primary this week ""shows how deep divisions are within the Democratic Party."" A racially diverse segment, ""located in cities and their surrounding suburbs, is largely behind Mrs. Clinton, while a less-diverse and largely rural part of the party backs Sen. Sanders."" Mrs. Clinton won narrowly, carrying the most populous counties and most of those with the largest African-American populations, Mr. Sanders the least populous and all the least diverse counties. His voters in Kentucky were rural and white, which was true also in Michigan and New York. ""The tensions within the party aren't likely to lessen,"" Mr. Chinni concluded.California votes June 7. A journalist this week speculated in conversation that if Mrs. Clinton underperforms or even loses there, it could be a gift. It will make her desperate. Presuming she goes on to win the nomination, her desperation might prompt her to make Bernie Sanders her vice presidential nominee.Why not? It would hold the party together for this cycle. It would help keep Sanders voters, who often threaten to go elsewhere if Mrs. Clinton is the nominee, in the tent. It would also unsettle Trumpworld. They see Bernie supporters as potential Trump supporters in the general election, and Mr. Sanders as having an appeal that overlaps with their own. They see his outsider mystique and his appeal to the young.Would Mrs. Clinton do it? If it were the only choice, she would. Would he? He hasn't ruled it out. In early May, Mr. Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he was ""focused"" on winning the nomination, and, if he does not succeed, ""we are going to fight as hard as we can"" to make the Democratic platform more ""progressive."" ""Then, after that,"" he said, ""certainly Secretary Clinton and I can sit down and talk and see where we go from there.""Maybe he'd hold Mrs. Clinton hostage on the platform before he would agree to be her vice president. Maybe she'd accept a more left-wing platform to get the vice president she thinks she needs.A Clinton-Sanders ticket would be the oldest presidential ticket in U.S. history, totaling a combined 142 years. You can characterize that as ancient and out of it, or you can see it as mature, experienced. Up against Mr. Trump, the latter might not look so bad.Mr. Trump too is looking for a vice president. I don't understand those who say he should get an attack dog, since he is an attack dog. He doesn't need a dramatic Northeastern governor with a reputation as a bully, he already has a reputation as a bully. Nor do I understand why they say Mr. Trump needs someone exciting. He's quite exciting enough. He doesn't require someone who can help him with the ins and outs of Capitol Hill. That would be nice and come in handy, but it's also the kind of talent he can hire as staff.What he needs is Stable Man or Stable Woman. He needs someone with real and obvious political accomplishment -- a longtime senator or, less attractively, a representative, or a governor, preferably a current one. John Kasich says he isn't interested, but maybe he will get interested. Newt Gingrich is on the list, which is understandable in many respects, but he has the same slightly mad quotient as Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump needs ""He's not crazy.""Big ships need ballast to keep the ship upright, to keep it from tipping over when a high wave comes. Ballast is by its nature uninteresting. Mr. Trump needs ballast. He would benefit from a solid, uninteresting running mate.Uninteresting would come as such a relief this year. It would be like the old days, when people were boring.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",8/1/16
Election 2016: Sanders War Chest Less Than $6 Million,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790150796?accountid=12768,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders's cash reserves dropped to less than $6 million in April, thanks to a sharp decline in the campaign's fundraising pace, narrowing his options as he heads into the final primary contests.Mr. Sanders had $5.8 million left in the bank at the end of last month, according to a Federal Election Commission report filed on Friday, about one-fifth of front-runner Hillary Clinton's $30.2 million war chest.Dwindling cash reserves are the result of the Vermont senator's sticking with a heavy rate of spending even as his fundraising dropped precipitously last month, when he raised $20 million less than in March.Mr. Sanders still managed to outraise Mrs. Clinton by $500,000 last month, but he spent about $15 million more than she did.He brought in $26.9 million in April but spent $38.6 million, while she raised $26.4 million and spent $23.9 million. Over the course of the campaign cycle through April, Mr. Sanders's campaign has spent $207 million to Mrs. Clinton's $182 million.A shrinking war chest only adds to Mr. Sanders's problems as he faces the final stretch of the primary.He is hundreds of delegates -- both pledged and unpledged -- behind Mrs. Clinton, and faces increasing pressure from Democratic Party leaders to dial back his attacks on Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders's smaller cash pile will make it more difficult to afford advertising for the final leg of the primary battle.Mr. Sanders and his advisers indicated this past week that he would stay in the race at least until voting concludes in mid-June and will continue pressing his case until the July convention.Already, Philadelphia has approved four demonstration permits in support of Mr. Sanders at the Democratic National Convention -- including a large rally planned near the convention's epicenter.As a result of Mr. Sanders's prolific spending, Mrs. Clinton stands in likely the strongest financial position of any candidate in either party as she faces the final days of her primary battle.On top of her campaign fundraising, her allied super PAC, Priorities USA Action, has raised a total of $76 million through April and had $46.7 million left on hand to use against Mr. Trump.The super PAC has also collected an additional $45 million in commitments, or pledges to donate at a future date, a spokesman said.Mr. Trump hadn't yet filed his report with the FEC as of late Friday.The new filings also offered a glimpse at the fundraising of candidates who have since quit the race.Ohio Gov. John Kasich raised $2.5 million for his campaign last month, but had $1.4 million left in the bank. His allied super PAC raised $2.4 million and had just $1.1 million in cash on hand.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz had $9 million left to spend at the end of April, but his network of allied super PACs saw their fundraising drop sharply last month.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",8/1/16
Bernie Isn't Hillary's Problem,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790149736?accountid=12768,"As more polls show that Hillary Clinton could lose to Donald Trump, Democratic media and political elites have decided that the problem is -- Bernie Sanders. The socialist warhorse has had his campaign fun, but now he and his supporters refuse to slink away quietly into Howard Dean obscurity. Doesn't he know that his persistence is helping Republicans?We'd humbly suggest that these Democrats are looking through the wrong end of the campaign telescope. Bernie's continuing string of victories is the symptom of the political demand for change after eight years of Democratic rule. The real Democratic problems this year are the Obama record and the Clinton candidacy.""I will be the nominee,"" Mrs. Clinton declared this week, and barring an act of God or the FBI director she is no doubt right. Mr. Sanders has a narrow window to get a majority of delegates, even without Mrs. Clinton's overwhelming lead among declared superdelegates. Unlike the GOP establishment, Democratic elites are getting the nominee they have wanted from the beginning.Yet Mr. Sanders continues to win primaries even if he has little chance at the nomination. He has won three of the last four major contests, and he lost Kentucky this week by fewer than 2,000 votes. A major chunk of the Democratic base is showing buyer's remorse at Mrs. Clinton's looming coronation and is encouraging Mr. Sanders to fight to the bitter end. Few Bernistas will vote for Mr. Trump, but some might decide to demonstrate their unhappiness at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia or stay home in November.Democrats can blame themselves for much of this political alienation. President Obama was only too happy to indulge the Occupy Wall Street movement when it served his purposes against Mitt Romney in 2012. He and his fellow Democrats played up resentment against ""the 1%,"" which Mr. Sanders and his voters have decided to take seriously and use as a cudgel against Mrs. Clinton.Democrats are especially sore at Mr. Sanders for the blowup last weekend at the Democratic state convention in Nevada, which included some ugly protest scenes. But most Democrats have also been happy to celebrate the Black Lives Matter movement despite its periodic calls to violence.No less than Mr. Obama praised the group at his recent commencement address at Howard University. ""It's thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you, from Black Twitter to Black Lives Matter, that America's eyes have been opened -- white, black, Democrat, Republican -- to the real problems, for example, in our criminal justice system,"" Mr. Obama told the graduates.No one should be surprised if this same politics of grievance and confrontation is now being aimed at Democrats too. All the more so when the party's presumptive nominee represents the very heart of the ""rigged"" political system that Mr. Sanders and the progressive left have long been describing.Hillary and Bill Clinton have used politics to become members of the richest 0.1%. She and her husband are walking conflicts of political interest -- see the Clinton Foundation and its foreign donors with business before the State Department. And Mrs. Clinton represents big money and Wall Street -- see her Goldman Sachs speeches.Above all Mrs. Clinton represents the policy status quo that for seven years has failed to deliver on its central promises of 2008 and 2012. Health-care costs haven't fallen, wages have barely risen, income inequality has worsened, and whites and blacks say that racial tensions have increased. This is the reality that the Sandernistas are implicitly rejecting when they say the system has failed them.Mr. Sanders's supporters are also figuring out that their man might have a better chance of beating Donald Trump than Mrs. Clinton does. Clinton Democrats won't say this explicitly, but they believe that an honest socialist can't win. Yet recent head-to-head polls show Mr. Trump ahead or close to Mrs. Clinton, while Mr. Sanders leads the Republican.The latest Fox News poll shows that Mrs. Clinton is viewed as more corrupt than Mr. Trump, 49% to 37%. She is also now viewed negatively by more of the electorate than is Mr. Trump -- 61% to 56%. This takes some doing given Mr. Trump's incendiary primary campaign and the continuing doubts about him among millions of Republicans.The 2016 campaign has a long way to go, and Mr. Trump has major vulnerabilities. But as the general election comes into focus, Democrats should wonder if they erred in clearing the nomination path for Mrs. Clinton. It was her turn, they thought. She'd mobilize the party's identity groups as the first woman nominee, and the Clinton political machine would do whatever it takes to win. The reality is that she may be the only Democrat who could lose to Donald Trump.",8/1/16
Rubin's Take: Democrats Face Reckoning on Wall Street Tax; A disagreement between the Sanders faction and Hillary Clinton could presage a fight over the issue if she is elected,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808034963?accountid=12768,"Of all the applause lines this election season, ""We're going to impose a tax on Wall Street speculation"" has perhaps been the wonkiest.Sen. Bernie Sanders's stump-speech staple reflects a desire among many Democrats, particularly the party's liberal wing, to impose a financial-transaction tax in a bid to raise revenue for top priorities like free tuition at public colleges.But a disagreement between the Sanders faction of the party and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton could presage a fight over the issue if she is elected. Unlike Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton says she favors a tax only on high-frequency trading, a small subset of overall financial transactions.The Democratic Party platform passed in Philadelphia last week lays bare those disagreements: It expresses support for a tax on high-frequency trading, but acknowledges that ""there is room within our party for a diversity of views on a broader financial transactions tax.""In contrast to Mrs. Clinton's narrowly tailored plan, Mr. Sanders and Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota have introduced companion bills that would impose a tax on the sales of stocks, bonds, derivatives and other investments. The exact tax varies by investment product--stocks at 0.5%, bonds with maturity over 60 days at 0.1% and derivatives at 0.005%.Estimates differ on how much such a plan would actually raise, largely due to disagreement over the effect on trading volume. A series of papers from the Tax Policy Center , a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, show that it could raise $50 billion to $70 billion a year. A report released last week by the liberal Economic Policy Institute pegs the revenue potential at $110 billion to $403 billion.Opponents of such a tax, including Wall Street trade groups, argue that taxing all financial transactions will hit middle-class investors through their 401(k)s and pensions. But trading transactions come with fees already, and many estimates show that a tax would decrease trading volume to the point where, on net, investors would actually save money. Dean Baker, an economist for the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote last week that the tax is only a negative for the financial industry, because the lost trading volume--and the associated fees--is ""money directly out of their pockets.""That's catnip to many liberals, particularly with the potential for eye-popping revenue figures. Mrs. Clinton, if elected, will have to decide whether embracing a broader version of the tax is worthwhile politically. It could placate members of her party who eye her warily for her ties to Wall Street. And, with Republicans who oppose the tax likely to maintain control of the House even if they lose their Senate majority, Mrs. Clinton likely wouldn't have to worry about the tax actually becoming law.If she did, it would be an important shift for a party that's negotiating ideological cleavages on regulatory and tax policy. In her Democratic National Convention speech , Mrs. Clinton showed a willingness to tap Wall Street for new revenue streams: because ""that's where the money is.""Write to Gabriel T.

Glass-Steagall-Trump-Clinton Act; The GOP joins Sanders and Warren in pointless re-regulation.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807429941?accountid=12768,"The Republican and Democratic Party platforms don't agree on much, so what does it mean that this year they both call for reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933? It means that as both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton pursue Bernie Sanders voters, they can be equally irrelevant to our current financial era.On Monday night Mr. Sanders celebrated an endorsement in the Democratic Party platform for reinstating Glass-Steagall, which had been one of his campaign themes. This followed last week's last-minute addition of a similar plank into the Republican platform. The GOP move was hailed by Mr. Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort, who probably maneuvered it to appeal to the Sanders voters who Mr. Trump is courting.Glass-Steagall separated commercial banking--i.e., taking deposits and making loans--from investment banking businesses like trading stocks and bonds. Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have flogged the belief that when Bill Clinton repealed what was left of Glass-Steagall in 1999, he opened the door for banks to gamble on Wall Street and thus caused the 2008 financial panic.Too bad there's no evidence that this had anything to do with the crisis. The panic started in investment firms like Bear Stearns that were not commercial banks. Ditto for Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. They failed because they ran into liquidity crises due to over-leverage and a portfolio of bad mortgage securities. AIG also wasn't a bank.The commercial banks that contributed most to the panic--including Wachovia and Washington Mutual--made too many bad mortgage loans. Bank of America got into trouble buying Countrywide Financial, which had issued too many bad mortgages. Citigroup made a mess with off-balance sheet assets that also included too much real estate.The real source of the crisis was the Federal Reserve's monetary policy that subsidized excess credit and federal affordable-housing goals that with the help of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encouraged subprime and ""liar"" mortgage loans. Plenty of small banks with little exposure to the capital markets but too much to real estate also failed. Glass-Steagall was irrelevant.With taxpayer backing and thin capital levels, bankers and financiers can find all kinds of trouble, whether on Wall Street or any other street, and regardless of the size of their firms. Having a regulator decide which risks to avoid creates its own risks, as when capital rules and credit-ratings requirements herded much of the financial world into supposedly safe mortgage-backed securities before the panic.The Volcker Rule that is part of Dodd-Frank is supposed to prevent commercial banks from risky securities trading, though it is so complicated it's hard to tell. Banks today are highly integrated and breaking them up would be difficult and highly disruptive. The better solution is to shrink the taxpayer safety net, raising capital standards high enough so that banks that take insured deposits can better withstand trading or lending mistakes. Outside the safety net, let companies take greater risks but also let them fail.This is the solution that House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling is promoting, and it doesn't include reinstating Glass-Steagall. If a new President insists on reinstating it anyway, then we trust Mr. Hensarling will exact a heavy negotiating price such as privatizing Fannie and Freddie, among other reforms.Related Articles* Fixing American Finance* The Great Recession Blame Game* What's Killing Jobs and Stalling the Economy",8/2/16
Election 2016: Trump Tries to Woo Sanders Supporters,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792474330?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, surveying the next phase of his Republican presidential campaign, is counting on a boost from an untapped well of disenchanted voters who hate the status quo, think the system is stacked against them and can't stand Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.That would be some supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders.""I'm hearing we're going to get close to 40% of his supporters,"" Mr. Trump said at a recent campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M. ""The system is rigged against Bernie, so he can't win"" in the Democratic presidential primary. ""We're going to get tremendous numbers from Bernie Sanders.""But making that prediction come true would require an extraordinary amount of persuasion, if recent opinion polls and interviews with Sanders backers are any indication.""That's absurd,"" said Frank Pringle, 32 years old, a law student in Richmond, Calif., at a Sanders rally. ""He is living in a fantasy world.""Frank Gamboa, 39, an Uber driver from Alameda, Calif., who supports Mr. Sanders, is struggling with his general-election options, but said, ""I cannot in good conscience vote for Trump.""In Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls over the first four months of 2016, just 6% of Sanders supporters felt positively about Mr. Trump, while 90% felt negatively. Faced with a Trump-Clinton choice, 10% of Sanders supporters said then they would vote forMr. Trump, and 81% would vote for Mrs. Clinton.But the latest Journal/NBC poll this month suggests that Mrs. Clinton could be losing ground; it found that 66% of Sanders supporters would vote for her against Mr. Trump, while 17% would vote for Mr. Trump. The other 17% of Sanders supporters said they would vote for neither candidate, another one, or weren't sure.If Mr. Trump wants to woo Sanders supporters, he will face the formidable obstacle of the Vermont senator's own virulent opposition to Mr. Trump's candidacy and calls for his backers to resist the temptation of Mr. Trump.""Donald Trump represents a whole lot that I passionately hate,"" Mr. Sanders said in an MSNBC interview this month. ""If I'm not the candidate, I will do everything that I can to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States.""The surprising rise of these two populist candidates has been a remarkable feature of the 2016 campaign, inviting comparisons between their appeals to angry voters.But the roots and goals of the Trump and Sanders phenomena are drastically different. Trump voters' anger is closely linked to frustration with Republican elites, and they tend to want government to dial back its role in social and economic problem solving. Sanders voters tend to think government should be more, not less, active in solving those problems.""The little guy has been getting left out in the cold my entire life,"" said Joe Marshall, 35, a Sanders supporter who works at the Joshua School for autistic children in Englewood, Colo. ""I happen to have more faith in the government's power to affect positive change in the world than a Donald Trump supporter.""Mr. Trump's attitude toward Mr. Sanders has been a moving target. He has coined the nickname ""Crazy Bernie."" He jokingly agreed to debate Mr. Sanders -- and then reneged on Friday. But more often than not, he seems to be wooing the senator's voters and treats Mr. Sanders with a gentler touch than he does other rivals.The Trump message may fall on more receptive ears among Sanders supporters whose antipathy toward Mrs. Clinton runs especially deep. Jordan Honeycutt, 24, an unemployed laborer in Kannapolis, N.C., said he would reluctantly pull the lever for Mr. Trump if he is the only alternative to Mrs. Clinton.""Anything but Clinton,"" Mr. Honeycutt said.Mr. Trump predicted that he would get ""tremendous"" support from millennials, the young voters who are a major bastion of Sanders voters. But the latest Journal/NBC News poll casts doubt on that prediction. Just 20% of voters aged 18 to 34 expressed positive feelings about Mr. Trump, while 71% felt unfavorably. In a head-to-head contest between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, he draws 32% of 18- to 34-year-olds, while she gets 55%.Mr. Sanders, who wasn't available for an interview, has rejected any comparison with Mr. Trump, and his stump speech includes a resolute slap at the New York businessman.Credit: By Janet Hook",8/4/16

"The Isolationist Temptation; With the rise of Trump and Sanders, the U.S. foreign-policy debate is now about whether to engage at all with the wider world",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809073419?accountid=12768,"It has been only a quarter-century since the end of the Cold War, but the U.S. is already in the midst of its second great foreign-policy debate of the post-Soviet era. The first, which carried us from the administration of the first President Bush through the second, was over the appropriate extent of America's global ambitions. It took place largely among foreign policy elites, between those who (roughly speaking) wanted to stabilize the world and decrease the chances of conflict, and those who sought to liberalize other countries, hoping to spread democracy and improve the lot of people suffering from tyranny and civil war.The second debate, which is being played out today, centers on whether the U.S. should retain the leading international role it has held since the end of World War II. Unlike the earlier debate, this one is taking place among elites and non-elites. It pits internationalists of every stripe against those who are isolationists or very nearly that, holding to a minimal view of what the U.S. should be doing beyond its borders.It is worth reviewing how we got to this point, because the seeds of the second debate were sown in part by the first. The 25 years since the end of the Cold War have been a time of uncharacteristic, even unprecedented, American primacy. Not surprisingly, some in the U.S. argued that this situation should be exploited. On the left and right alike, voices called for the U.S. to do things in the world not out of necessity but out of choice, not because vital national interests were at stake but because there were perceived opportunities to do good.This view wasn't universal. The principal alternative was a more modest view of what the U.S. could accomplish--one consistent with what is known as the realist school, which holds that the principal aim of U.S. foreign policy should be to shape the foreign policy of other governments, not their internal political arrangements.This debate was intense and prolonged. It actually started before the Berlin Wall was torn down, when pro-democracy protests erupted in the spring of 1989 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Voices across the political spectrum urged President George H.W. Bush to support the students and to severely sanction China's communist government, but he resisted. He thought that U.S. pressure would serve only to alienate leaders with whom we needed to work in meeting a growing number of regional and global challenges.Even more pronounced was the debate over the 1990-91 Gulf War. The George H.W. Bush administration, with its mostly realist approach to foreign policy, was content with forcing Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, restoring that country's sovereignty and reducing the threat posed by Iraq to the region. For others, this wasn't enough. They were disappointed that U.S. forces didn't march on to Baghdad and oust Saddam Hussein when he was on his heels.Realism won out in this case, but the debate was hardly settled. Idealists were right to argue that a search for stability alone would never be enough to capture the imagination of the American people and that U.S. foreign policy needed to be premised on principles as well as interests. But after Bill Clinton's defeat of President Bush in 1992, the new Democratic administration found it hard to reconcile its desire to do good with the difficulty of doing good. That tension helps to explain the Clinton administration's limited and inconsistent responses to civil conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Haiti and Rwanda.The next watershed event was 9/11. President George W. Bush wished to go beyond removing the Taliban government in Afghanistan that had harbored al Qaeda. Saddam Hussein quickly became the administration's focus. The president and many of his advisers wanted to make sure that Iraq did not possess and would not develop weapons of mass destruction. Even more, they were attracted to the bold idea of bringing democracy to Iraq, creating an example that the rest of the Middle East, including Iran, would feel pressured to emulate. (I served in both Bush administrations, father and son, and favored the first Iraq war but not the second.)Events didn't work out as planned. It was one thing to oust a dictator, something quite different to put in place a successor government that was democratic and enduring. Iraq thus became the third costly war of choice in modern American history, joining Korea (in our vain attempt to unify the country by marching north of the 38th parallel) and Vietnam.The Arab Spring of 2011 at first played into the hands of those with a more ambitious approach to U.S. foreign policy. The revolutions in Egypt, Yemen, Syria and other Arab autocracies seemed to present a second chance to make good on George W. Bush's objective of democratizing the Arab world.But with the partial exception of Tunisia , possibility turned to disappointment: A military strongman staged a coup in Egypt; a civil war in Syria has left 400,000 dead and has displaced most of the country's citizens; the removal of a tyrant in Libya created killing fields now exploited by Islamic State. Meanwhile, the two countries where U.S. investment and involvement have been the most extensive, Iraq and Afghanistan, appear to have become open-ended civil conflicts fought between flawed regimes and even more flawed opponents.What has become painfully clear is that our effort to remake the Middle East has failed. The gap between promises and results, benefits and costs, has been huge. At home, disillusionment and recrimination are pervasive. Intervention fatigue has set in, and the public no longer has an appetite for an ambitious foreign policy. The first foreign policy debate, over the scope of American aims, is effectively over.But more than just foreign-policy failure explains how we got to where we are. A foreign policy dedicated to changing or saving the world is a foreign policy of luxury. It is one thing to sacrifice on behalf of vital interests, and another to pay in lives and dollars for preferences. Americans today are in no mood for such extravagance in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the slower-than-normal economic recovery, the realization that certain jobs are never returning and the mounting evidence of rising inequality.It is this combination of dissatisfaction with foreign policy and economic frustration that has given rise to a new isolationism. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that most Americans prefer for the U.S. to deal with its own problems and to let other countries handle their own as best they can. A plurality of Americans says that the U.S. already does too much to solve the world's problems.These preferences cross party lines. Indeed, today's debates are more within the two major parties than between them. There is considerable overlap between the policies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders and between the Republican and Democratic platforms. Foreign policy gets short shrift: The Republican platform is awash in generalities, while its Democratic counterpart consists mostly of criticisms of Mr. Trump. Both platforms are skeptical of the benefits of free trade and oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership as it has been negotiated.There are differences, of course, between the parties and the candidates. Mr. Trump is explicit in his call for a radically different U.S. role, questioning the value of American alliances in Europe and Asia alike. It is revealing that his adopted slogan of ""America First"" initially gained currency in the 1930s as the isolationist banner of Charles Lindbergh, who fought to keep the U.S. out of the fight against Hitler's Germany.Hillary Clinton, by contrast, fits squarely within the foreign policy mainstream. But many in the Democratic Party do not. It was telling that former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Leon Panetta had his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia interrupted by chants of ""No more war."" Mrs. Clinton is the Democrats' candidate, but she may not represent the future of a party whose activists echo their 1972 presidential candidate George McGovern and his call for America to ""Come Home.""The result is a second great foreign-policy debate, between a besieged traditional internationalism and an energized new isolationism. The stakes in this debate are very high. It is one thing to question American overreach; it is something very different to question American reach.The world is not self-organizing. An invisible hand may help to guide the markets, but no such force is at work in geopolitics. For the past 75 years, the visible hand of the U.S., more than any other factor, has created and maintained conditions of stability. Given the number and strength of forces now undermining order around the globe, a capable and reliable U.S. is more essential than ever before.The consequences of a lasting American retreat from the world would be dire. The Middle East is arguably the most salient example of what happens when the U.S. pulls back. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. has mostly stayed out of Syria, failed to follow up on its intervention in Libya, largely left Iraq and committed to leave Afghanistan. We have since returned to Iraq, and our withdrawal from Afghanistan was never complete, but the substance and signal of a diminished U.S. role have contributed greatly to instability in the region. Not acting can be every bit as consequential as acting.In Asia, whose countries represent the greatest concentration of population, wealth and military might, the results of U.S. disengagement would be dangerous indeed: preeminence in the region for China along with a much greater likelihood of conflict on the Korean Peninsula and in the several places where there are rival claims to territory and seas. Likewise, a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe and NATO, as Mr. Trump has proposed in his ad hoc way, could lead to greater Russian influence and more frequent conflict.Commitments to allies serve two purposes. One is to deter would-be adversaries and to reduce the chances of conflict. The other is to reassure countries that would otherwise have to appease their more powerful neighbors or develop their own capacities for self-defense, which in this era could entail developing nuclear weapons. The benefits and influence that the U.S. derives from its longstanding alliance commitments far exceed the costs.Isolationists must not prevail in this new debate over foreign-policy fundamentals, one which I had never imagined would take place in my lifetime. Turning away from global engagement would mean not just opportunities lost: in jobs reliant on exports, the chance to invest overseas, the ability to travel without fear. It also would bring conflict and nuclear proliferation. As the world unraveled, Americans would be more vulnerable to terrorism, illegal immigration, climate change and disease.We do not have the option of becoming a giant gated community. Sooner or later, we would feel compelled to step in to restore stability and to right the balance of power.What will it take for internationalists to advance their cause in today's bitter debate? A start would be to rebuild a consensus in favor of free trade. Trade has multiple benefits. It contributes to economic growth and to well-paying export-oriented jobs. It can fuel development, thereby reducing the number of weak or failed states that host terrorists, pirates and drug cartels. It can strengthen allies. And it can enmesh potential adversaries in a network of mutually beneficial ties that make the option of disrupting them through war less attractive.Winning the debate, though, will take more than marshaling facts. Those who lose their jobs because of trade deserve assistance, both to tide them over and to train them for new jobs. Trade partners must be held to high standards when it comes to labor conditions, the environment and manipulation of currencies. The playing field must be level.The cause of internationalism would also be helped by policies that increase economic growth, from infrastructure modernization to tax, entitlement and immigration reform. Populism and parochialism are much more likely to gain traction amid anxiety over jobs and stagnant or declining standards of living.It also will be important to remind Americans of the benefits of U.S. leadership--and the likely costs of abdication. Current U.S. spending on defense as a percentage of GDP is close to a post-World War II low. We can do what we should in the world at a reasonable cost.Congress has a role to play in this wider discussion of America's global role; televised hearings dealing with fundamental foreign policy issues could be invaluable. The next secretary of state will want to spend more time at home explaining why American world leadership is as much a favor to ourselves as to others.Above all, the president will want to take advantage of the unique classroom that is the Oval Office. Mr. Obama could do worse than to use some part of his remaining months as president to discuss with the American people why the world matters and how the U.S. gains from what it does beyond its borders--and stands to lose if it fails to do them. Success in reminding Americans of their deep stake in the wider world could turn out to be one of his most important legacies.Dr. Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of ""A World in Disarray: American Foreign Policy and the Crisis of the Old Order,"" which will be published in January by the Penguin Press.Related Reading* Brexit: A Very British Revolution (June 24, 2016)* After Orlando, a Long War (June 17, 2016)* For China, a Plunge and a Reckoning (Aug. 28, 2015)* Desert Storm, the Last Classic War (July 31, 2015)Credit: By Richard N.

"From Wall Street to Sing Sing; The Bernie Madoff of his time, Richard Whitney had tasted glory in 1930 as the youngest president ever of the New York Stock Exchange.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810164365?accountid=12768,"The most prominent Wall Streeter-turned-jailbird emerged from Sing Sing 75 years ago this week, in 1941. In raw dollar figures, Richard Whitney's financial folly fell far short of Bernie Madoff's--a few $100,000s (in 1930s dollars), here and there, a mere drop in the latter's Ponzi bucket of billions. But Whitney was much better known on the public stage long before he went to the pen.A Boston-bred blue blood whose youthful pedigrees included Groton and Harvard's Porcellian Club, Whitney bought a New York Stock Exchange seat at age 23. He was elected to the NYSE board of governors in 1919. In 1930, at age 41, he became the youngest president in the exchange's 138-year history.Whitney's star shined brightest on his institution's bleakest day--Black Thursday, Oct. 24, 1929. As stock prices plummeted, Whitney, then the exchange's vice president, conferred with the city's elite bankers to reverse the slide. Acting with their cash, he strode onto the exchange floor, walked up to U.S. Steel's trading booth, and bought a huge block of shares at $205, far above the listed price. He similarly bid up General Electric and other sagging blue chips. He was hailed as a savior as the market steadied.Five days later--Black Tuesday--came the heaviest selloff in the exchange's history. No rescue this time. As America lapsed into its Great Depression, Whitney began the first of five terms as exchange president. On leaving the exchange presidency in 1935, he focused on an apparently thriving brokerage firm and personal investments.But all was sham. He speculated, lost, then speculated more. Unsecured sums lent by relatives, friends and business associates failed to cover losses. He embezzled $214,000 from client accounts. He misappropriated funds from his father-in-law's estate. He raided the New York Yacht Club treasury. He even dipped into the New York Stock Exchange Gratuity Fund, of which he was trustee.The dam broke in March 1938, when an audit of NYSE member firms revealed that Richard Whitney & Co. was insolvent. Public disclosures followed, and then came a grand jury indictment. Whitney pleaded guilty to embezzlement.On April 12, Whitney stepped out of a police van at Grand Central Station and boarded a train to go up the river to Sing Sing. First assigned to mop floors, he was soon promoted to chief clerk in a prison office and regarded as a model prisoner. Fellow convicts and guards asked for autographs.When a paroled Whitney walked out to freedom on Aug. 11, 1941. A chauffeured limousine awaited. Inside was his elder brother, George, a partner and pillar at J.P. Morgan & Co. who had paid off all of his wayward brother's debts. Richard Whitney then drove away into obscurity.At one point he was said to be managing a small dairy farm, but he was never newsworthy again until he died on Dec. 5, 1974. And once more after 2008, when the old print media, which once knew him well, and the electronic media, which knew him not at all, began looking for past Madoffs on Wall Street.Mr. Rosenberg is the author, with Louis Eisenstein, of ""A Stripe of Tammany's Tiger"" (Cornell University, 2013 paperback).Related Articles* Blue Blood, Red Ink* Out for Blood* Taking Revenge on the Rich Will Not Bring RecoveryCredit: By Elliot Rosenberg",8/10/16
"Hillary Clinton's Free College-Tuition Plan Short on Specifics; Details on Democratic presidential candidate's proposal, put forth during negotiations with party rival Bernie Sanders, are hard to come by",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811152886?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton, who prides herself on the details of public policy, has said little about what is now the most ambitious and expensive proposal on her agenda: making public college tuition free for most Americans .On the campaign trail, she typically offers a sentence, maybe two, about the plan. Sometimes it goes unmentioned altogether. Her campaign has offered few specifics about how the program would work, hasn't said how much money states would have to provide or where the program would fall on her list of priorities.The campaign website no longer lists a cost for the program, though campaign aides said they estimate it would take $500 billion in new federal spending over 10 years, $150 billion more thanthe college plan she put out last summer . Others estimate the costs would be much higher.The sketchiness may owe something to the way the free-tuition plan came to be part of Mrs. Clinton's platform. Rather than taking months or years to craft, like many of her other proposals, it was inserted as part of negotiations in July to win the backing of Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders.Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, who tracks higher education and other issues at the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, said it was obvious that the plan was put together to win over Mr. Sanders.Most of Mrs. Clinton's policy proposals ""are five pages of dense text with very specific ways of how they're going to pay for it and how much it would cost,"" she said. ""This sounded much more like something intended to energize a campaign rally.""The Clinton plan still is more detailed than most of the ideas put forth by her opponent, Republican Donald Trump, who doesn't typically give the cost of his plans and sometimes changes significant planks. Still, Mrs. Clinton prides herself on her policy chops and says candidates owe it to voters to be clear about their plans. Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.Mrs. Clinton says she would pay for the college plan with higher taxes on the wealthy, including new limits on deductions. Campaign aides said that once school is back in session and younger voters are paying more attention, she would talk more about the college plan.Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said Mrs. Clinton is ""deeply committed"" to the revised plan. ""Hillary Clinton put forward an ambitious proposal in the primary and, after listening to voters on the campaign trail, expanded it to more effectively reach the goal of erasing the barrier of debt to a college of education,"" he said.Passing this program into law will be a challenge, though, particularly if Republicans continue to control at least one house of Congress. Even some Democrats think Mrs. Clinton's first proposal would have a better chance and worry that the revised version is too heavy a lift.The new Clinton policy was described in a single paragraph issued by the campaign in early July amid talks with Mr. Sanders, who had campaigned against her in the primary on a more expansive free-tuition plan. His concept was that public colleges should be free for all, like public high schools.Mrs. Clinton had already put forth a detailed plan last summer to assure that students could attend public colleges without borrowing money for tuition, but she said families should contribute what they could afford. To win over Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton agreed that students in families earning $85,000 a year or less would be assured free tuition, with that threshold climbing to $125,000 over four years.The political goals were clear. The policy was a priority for Mr. Sanders, and after her shift, he endorsed her. She also put herself in position to appeal to younger voters, who overwhelmingly backed Mr. Sanders in the primaries and are an important part of the coalition that twice elected President Barack Obama.In his speech at July's Democratic National Convention endorsing Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders specifically cited this policy shift. It was one of several she made that were key to winning his support, including an agreement to back additional funding for community health centers.For now, the new plan appears to cut against two points Mrs. Clinton made during the primaries.First, she had long described her plan, which she calls the New College Compact , as a balanced way of making sure all players have ""skin in the game,"" including federal and state governments, universities, families and students.""I think it ought to be a compact,"" she said during a Democratic debate last year. ""Families contribute, kids contribute.""Under her new plan, 80% of families would qualify for tuition-free school, even if they could afford some contribution. A Clinton aide replied by noting that students are still expected to have a job that will help pay expenses, and said that it is most important that government pay its fair share.Second, one of her chief criticisms of the Sanders tuition-free plan was that it relied on governors, including critical Republican governors, to put up one-third of the funding. But her plan requires substantial state contributions as well, though her campaign hasn't specified how much.The Clinton aide said states will be more likely to fund her plan because it would be phased in gradually.She did stick by her view, voiced often during the primaries, that the government shouldn't offer free tuition to very rich families.Other aspects of the Clinton plan would lower borrowing costs for existing borrowers and those who attend private colleges, and would make community college free.Meantime, Mrs. Clinton appears to be offering another change to her program that she hasn't yet explained. In an economic speech on Thursday , she promised ""tuition-free"" college for the middle class, and ""debt-free college"" for everyone.Aides said debt-free is a goal meant to assure no student has to borrow money to pay any college costs, including room, board and other expenses, which can represent half the total costs. That goes beyond her original concept and isn't detailed in the pages of facts sheets provided by her campaign.Many advocates welcome the expansions. Tamara Draut, of the advocacy group Demos, which promotes debt-free college, said it is essential that students be able to pay for all college expenses without taking loans, and that this is her understanding of the Clinton plan. She said she expects more details to come.""I think we're a long way from governing and there is more detail there than her opponent's policy platforms, for sure,"" she said.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comMore on Election 2016* Hillary Clinton Widens Lead Over Donald Trump in Battleground States (Aug. 12)* Hillary Clinton Releases Tax Return, Pressuring Donald Trump to Follow (Aug. 12)* Washington Wire: Trump Warns of Electoral 'Cheating' During Pennsylvania Rally (Aug. 12)Credit: By Laura Meckler",8/15/16
"Long Before the Bernie Bros; Politics in the 19th century was a form of entertainment. Soon it had fierce competition: the bicycle craze, team sports and vaudeville.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811454802?accountid=12768,"It is often taken as a good thing when young people show an interest in politics--especially, it seems, when they vote to the left of their elders. In 1972, for example, young voters split evenly between Richard Nixon and George McGovern, and in 2012 they provided pretty much all of Barack Obama's popular-vote margin.But these were not the peak years of young Americans' influence on electoral politics. The peak came in the turbulent politics of the pre-Civil War years and the decades after, roughly 1840 to 1900. The period is chronicled in vivid and loving detail by Jon Grinspan, a historian and Smithsonian curator, in ""The Virgin Vote.""The book's title comes not from the snarky 2012 campaign video--the one using double-entendre to encourage young women to vote for Barack Obama--but from a label proudly self-applied in the 19th century by young men who were casting their vote for the first time. ""Virgin voters were likely to vote in groups, often joined by brothers, father and friends,"" Mr. Grinspan writes. And the commotion attracted notice: ""While young men fluffed their beards, donned new hats and headed off to the polls, their sisters looked on with a combination of support, pride and--sometimes--resentment.""The Virgin VoteBy Jon Grinspan North Carolina, 256 pages, $28Virgin voting and active electioneering were well-nigh universal in mid- and late 19th-century America. From 1840 to 1900, Mr. Grinspan says, between 70% and 80% of those eligible to vote did so in every presidential election, more than ever before or since. Young women were active as well, canvassing and participating in rallies. Young free blacks voted, too, until they were blocked from the polls by Democratic politicians and the Ku Klux Klan.Drawing on a wide range of scholarship and dozens of diaries, Mr. Grinspan tells his story more in personal than statistical terms. We see 19-year-old Oscar Lawrence Jackson orating for Abraham Lincoln in southern Ohio in 1860; 15-year-old George Washington Albright sneaking out at night to tell other slaves on nearby Mississippi plantations about the Emancipation Proclamation; 16-year-old James Witham arguing politics in the caboose of a westbound train in Nebraska in 1872.In some of these accounts we hear serious arguments about politics and policy, but they also include ridicule and rowdiness, alcohol consumption and tobacco expectoration, flirting and frivolity, and roving gangs of young men like Lincoln's Wide Awake boys, who prowled at the edge of crowds looking for trouble. Altogether Mr. Grinspan's narrative is a riveting picture of 19th-century politicking.And a picture in some ways unsettling. Young Americans tended to inherit their political views from their elders and, in this supercharged political atmosphere, tended to stick with the party they supported with their virgin votes. There were some exceptions--Mr. Grinspan zeroes in on the party-switching and ultimately nonpartisan author William Dean Howells--but party loyalties then seem much like loyalties to sports teams today: You keep rooting for the Yankees or the Cowboys regardless of changes in players and coaches and owners, overlooking the team's weaknesses and excusing its fouls. Sometimes old parties disappear and new ones are formed, as in the 1850s, just as sports leagues expand and teams relocate. But mostly this was a period, not unlike our two most recent decades, of static partisan divisions, with just a few votes making the difference between victory and defeat.Yet the rough-and-ready politics of such a time had to deal with the great, and greatly divisive, issues of slavery and civil rights, which accounted for some of the fervor of the virgin voters. One reads Mr. Grinspan's chapter on Oscar Lawrence Jackson's 1860 speech aware that the victory of his candidate culminated in a civil war in which 600,000 died--and in which Jackson himself survived a shot in the face. He was elected to Congress in the 1880s and died in 1920.By that time the age of the virgin voter was long over. Voter participation began to fall off in the 1890s. One reason was reform, starting with the ballot itself. Initially each political party printed ballots with only its own candidates listed. The ballots were distributed to would-be virgin voters by armies of young men on Election Day. Between 1887 and 1896, to prevent ballot-box stuffing and discourage straight-ticket voting, most states adopted the so-called Australian ballot, which listed candidates of all parties and was handed out by election clerks. Casting votes, including virgin votes, became a perfunctory matter, Mr. Grinspan notes, rather than a theatrical performance.For the youth of this period, politics was clearly a form of entertainment, but it eventually met competition: The bicycle craze, the rise of team sports like baseball and the growth of vaudeville provided other pastimes and venues where young men and women could spend time together. By the 1890s, Mr. Grinspan writes, ""youth and politics were quietly untangling themselves."" Even as the potential electorate was expanded by women's suffrage and the naturalization of Ellis Island immigrants, political participation and voter turnout declined.Should we wish for a revival of young people's participation in politics? Implicitly throughout and explicitly in an afterword, the author answers ""yes."" Amid so many distractions, he argues, the key ""to getting young people involved in politics, regardless of brain chemistry or habits, is to raise them in a culture that cares.""A skeptic may question whether the quality of the election result is improved by the participation of the otherwise indifferent and whether a caring culture will always care wisely. ""The Virgin Vote"" plunges readers into a pulsating political culture long vanished--and unlikely to be revived in a year when most young voters dislike both major parties' presidential nominees.Mr. Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and co-author of ""The Almanac of American Politics.""Credit: By Michael Barone",8/16/16
California Liberals Await the Bernie Effect,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793508614?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders is hoping to pull off an upset victory over Hillary Clinton in California's June 7 presidential primary, buttressing his argument to Democratic superdelegates -- now in the favorite's pocket -- that Mrs. Clinton isn't too big to fail. But even if Mr. Sanders loses on Tuesday, he could be a winner for California's liberal politicians: The self-described socialist is expected to turn out masses of young people, and that could be a boon for down-ballot left-wing candidates for the state legislature.In heavily Democratic California, the party's primary is when most legislative contests are decided, and those can hinge on a few hundred votes. Despite California's open primary, in which the top two finishers regardless of their party face each other in November, it's unlikely that two Democrats will emerge unless there's very low Republican turnout. The Sanders effect could give Democrats a supermajority in Sacramento, pulling the party -- and the state -- even further to the left than it already is.Public unions, liberal groups, government reformers and businesses are wading into the primary in a big way. Because of term limits, there are six Senate (of 40) and 16 Assembly seats (of 80) open. The goal of many working to influence the primary is to shift the moderate-liberal balance of power in the Democratic caucus, since the Republican minority is usually irrelevant except for close votes to block tax increases.Consider the 27th Assembly-district race in Silicon Valley, where six Democrats and one Republican are on the primary ballot. The general election is unlikely to be competitive since Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by more than two to one.The leading Democratic contenders are Madison Nguyen and Ash Kalra, both of whom have recently served on the San Jose city council. In 2012, Ms. Nguyen supported sweeping public-pension reforms -- which Mr. Kalra complains ""eroded employee morale and created the most toxic labor-management relationship in the city's history."" Labor groups have endorsed Mr. Kalra, while Ms. Nguyen enjoys support from government reformers, like former mayor Chuck Reed, who hope to elect more moderate Democrats to the legislature.In an overlapping Senate district, oil companies have spent $340,000 backing a challenge by term-limited Democratic Assembly member Nora Campos to unseat incumbent Jim Beall. Ms. Campos was one of 21 Democratic Assembly members (most representing middle and low-income communities) who helped defeat a sweeping climate-change bill last year that would have given the California Air Resources Board plenary authority to cut statewide gas consumption by 50%. Ms. Campos recently said: ""I always think about real-world impacts from the legislation we pass,"" a sentiment not shared by many Democrats in Sacramento. Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer has spent $500,000 supporting Mr. Beall.In the 11th Senate district, San Francisco supervisors Jane Kim and Scott Wiener are sparring over ""quality of life"" issues. Ms. Kim, a former Green Party member who was recently endorsed by Bernie Sanders, supports a ""Right to Rest"" bill in the legislature that would bar police from clearing homeless encampments. She also wants to restrict tech-company shuttle buses that ferry employees around town and have stirred resentment in some quarters. Considered a pro-business moderate in San Francisco, Mr. Wiener opposes both proposals.The Democratic supervisors also differed on a pair of local referendums last fall that would have imposed a building moratorium on market-rate condos in San Francisco's Mission District and limited short-term apartment rentals through startups like Airbnb. Both referendums failed despite Ms. Kim's backing.In the Central Coast 30th Assembly district, public unions, nearly all Democratic statewide officers and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon are backing Karina Cervantez Alejo, the wife of term-limited Assembly member Luis Alejo, who is known as a good friend to labor. In wine country's third Senate district, public unions are bankrolling Mariko Yamada, who supports free community-college education and a ban on foods including genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. Ms. Yamada's main contender is Democratic assembly member Bill Dodd, a former Republican.In these and other races, liberal candidates may benefit from the Sanders campaign. The senator's supporters have been holding voter-registration drives throughout the Bay Area, including at medical marijuana shops, farmers markets and college campuses. Last month, analytics firm Political Data reported that new voter registration in California during the first four months of this year is at its highest since 1980. Nearly half of newly registered voters are Democrats; just 16.7% are Republicans. Two-thirds are under age 35, and about 30% are Hispanic.These trends suggest that the primary electorate will be more liberal than usual, a good sign for Democrats. The party needs only to pick up one Senate and two Assembly seats to reclaim the supermajority that Democrats briefly held in 2013 before three senators were separately indicted on charges of corruption and fraud. (Two have since been convicted.) Fair warning to California voters who also pay taxes: This time around, thanks to Bernie Sanders, a Democratic supermajority would likely be much more liberal than the last one.---Ms. Finley is an editorial writer for the Journal.Credit: By Allysia Finley",8/17/16
Bernie the Economic Warrior,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792700069?accountid=12768,"The Golden State Warriors rallied to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder in game seven of the NBA western conference finals Monday, and among the celebrities on hand was Bernie Sanders. Even politicians deserve an occasional respite from politics -- though the Vermont socialist couldn't resist a political allusion of his own.""The Warriors were down 3-1 and they turned it around and I think that that's what we're going to do too. A very good omen for our campaign,"" Mr. Sanders said, according to the pool report. He'll take anything he can get ahead of the California primary next week, though for now his induction into Dub Nation raises some questions about his conception of economic justice.To wit, does Mr. Sanders consider Oakland's Oracle Arena a monument to the corporate greed he so often decries? Why was he cheering, rather than occupying? Isn't the minimum wage spelled out in Steph Curry's four-year, $44 million contract an outrage when income inequality is growing? Is it right that the team that scores the most points wins, rather than redistributing points equally?Then there's Mr. Sanders's unearned privilege to sit in the 15th row behind the Thunder basket, with the actor Danny Glover (""Lethal Weapon"" 1-4). The pool reporter, Joe Garofoli of the San Francisco Chronicle, joked that Mr. Sanders scored ""good seats but not the ones frequented by millionaires and billionaires.""Maybe so, but ESPN reveals that list prices for tickets averaged $960, and tickets near Mr. Sanders's section were trading on the secondary market between $1,650 and $1,750. Courtside floor seats a few rows ahead were going for as much as $58,000 a pair.That small fortune could almost pay for a year of debt-free tuition at an elite university. Contra Mr. Garofoli, it's reasonable to conclude Mr. Sanders sat among the 1% he otherwise says need to be held accountable, and presumably he doesn't mean for Mr. Glover's movies ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" and ""Dirty Grandpa.""Ethics rules prohibit Senators from accepting gifts valued over $100, with an exception for gifts over $250 from personal friends with written permission. If the campaign purchased or reimbursed the ticket for the candidate, that's a lot of $27 contributions. Perhaps Mr. Sanders should clarify exactly which type of money he wants out of politics.",8/17/16
Election 2016: Sanders Backers Work to Shape Party's Platform,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794399312?accountid=12768,"The prolonged Democratic presidential fight now shifts to a different arena, as Sen. Bernie Sanders and his supporters grapple with presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton over their imprint on a platform that will lay out the party's vision and policy goals.A party's platform is often a forgettable offshoot of the presidential nomination process. Once in office, presidents tend to follow their judgment and don't typically pull out the party platform for guidance.But the Sanders-Clinton battle for the nomination was filled with policy disagreements that carry the potential to leave the party divided. Mrs. Clinton is in a stronger position to shape the platform, but the Sanders forces are hoping to produce a document that reflects some portion of his liberal agenda. Should Mr. Sanders and his supporters come away dissatisfied, it could complicate the Democrats' task of unifying the party following a bitter nomination contest.Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, voiced optimism that the two sides would bridge their differences. ""Let's all remember, there is far more that unites us than divides us,"" he said.Indeed, issues of crime, punishment and race might be areas of agreement. Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have denounced police tactics that critics say target African-Americans.A Sanders campaign representative, Jonathan Tasini, said that coming to consensus wouldn't be easy. ""It's a mistake to think there will be a 'Kumbaya' moment,"" he said. ""We're not going to be standing there on the floor swaying with arms locked. There are fundamental differences about the future of the country and the party.""Work begins this week in Washington, D.C., as the party's 15-member platform drafting committee holds two days of hearings devoted to the economy, education, foreign policy and other issues. The panel's task is to help produce a platform that delegates will approve in July at the nominating convention in Philadelphia.Tensions are evident. Mr. Sanders tried to appoint to the drafting committee RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of a national nurses union and a strong advocate for a single-payer, government-run health-care system that Mrs. Clinton insists cannot pass.Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz turned down the request. A convention official gave as the reason for excluding Ms. DeMoro a need for diverse membership of convention committees, which means not stacking them with labor leaders.The Sanders campaign has also filed a formal protest asking the DNC to remove Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy from his post as co-chairman of the full platform committee. A DNC panel last month rejected the request, but the Sanders campaign has said it would persist in trying to disqualify Mr. Malloy, describing him as a biased, Clinton partisan. A Malloy representative didn't respond to a request for comment.Another flashpoint is foreign policy. The drafting panel includes six people named by Mrs. Clinton, five by Mr. Sanders and four by Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Two of the Sanders appointees are Cornel West and James Zogby, both of whom have been critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.During the campaign, Mrs. Clinton supported a Middle East peace deal that would give Palestinians their own state. Still, there's no certainty Mrs. Clinton would go along with platform language that opponents might portray as elevating the Palestinian cause at the expense of an important U.S. ally, Israel.Other policy differences abound. Mr. Sanders wants a national minimum wage of $15; Mrs. Clinton supports a $12 minimum wage, though she has said she would back a $15 wage in some locations. Mr. Sanders opposes free-trade agreements; Mrs. Clinton has taken more of a case-by-case approach.""If we don't get a very firm position against free trade, that will be a problem for me and a lot of other people,"" Mr. Tasini said.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",8/22/16
Election 2016: Democrats Strive for Party Unity --- Pressure builds for Sanders to rally behind presumptive nominee Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794723189?accountid=12768,"A Democratic Party that split over the fiercely contested presidential primary fight took its first steps toward uniting Wednesday, with prominent Bernie Sanders supporters conceding he had lost the race and saying they would rally behind the presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton.A day after Mrs. Clinton won California and three other states, Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who was the lone U.S. senator to endorse Mr. Sanders, said she has earned the party's nomination.""Once we have a candidate who has won the majority of the pledged delegates and the majority of the votes, we have a nominee,"" Mr. Merkley said. ""I had hoped the outcome would be that Bernie Sanders would win. In a democracy, one wins and others don't.""Aides to Mr. Sanders said he would stay in the race at least through June 14, when Washington, D.C., holds the final Democratic primary. Mr. Sanders was scheduled to hold a campaign event in Washington on Thursday and was also to meet privately with President Barack Obama.Before the voting on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders had said that he would carry the fight all the way to the convention next month in Philadelphia and would try to pry the nomination from Mrs. Clinton by urging her superdelegates to back his candidacy.A liberal group that had endorsed Mr. Sanders, Democracy for America, said Wednesday that if Mr. Sanders follows through on such plans, it wouldn't go along. With Mrs. Clinton leading by 376 pledged delegates -- the kind elected by voters -- it would be wrong for superdelegates to step in and effectively overturn the popular vote, the group said.""We believe [Mr. Sanders] has the right to do that, but we do not plan to help him do that,"" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the group, which recruits and promotes liberal candidates for elective office.Stepping off the sidelines, Mr. Obama is set to endorse Mrs. Clinton as early as Thursday. The pair will later make a joint campaign appearance in a battleground state targeting independent voters, people familiar with the matter said.Mr. Obama seems prepared to play peacemaker and ensure the party is unified in the general election showdown with Republican Donald Trump.In an interview Wednesday on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" Mr. Obama said: ""It was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary. I thought that Bernie Sanders brought enormous energy and new ideas."" He said his hope is ""that over the next couple of weeks we're able to pull things together.""The president has spoken to Mr. Sanders at least twice in recent weeks, hoping to gauge what Mr. Sanders might want from the party. The two are scheduled to meet Thursday, and the president is expected to say it is time for Democrats to set aside differences and embark on the larger project of defeating Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.Even some of Mr. Sanders's advisers aren't entirely sure what he'll do next. He left California and was scheduled to spend the night at his home in Burlington, Vt., on Wednesday.It was unclear whether Mr. Sanders intended to carry out his plan to peel away Mrs. Clinton's superdelegates, or if the four defeats he suffered had caused him to rethink his options.""What he said before June 7th may not be the case after June 7th,"" said Sanders pollster Ben Tulchin. ""The reality is he's going back to Vermont. And he has to absorb it and take it in. . . . He's got to figure out how he can continue this progressive movement in the most effective and impactful way.""Behind the political drama is the disappointment surely felt by a candidate who was never expected to get this far. A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders wound up winning 22 states. Both the Clinton campaign and Mr. Sanders's allies have sought not to antagonize him by pressuring him to drop out.Mrs. Clinton knows firsthand how difficult it is to accept defeat. In her 2008 campaign against Mr. Obama, she stayed in the race until the final contests and then waited four days before giving a speech bowing out.Although the two have a strained relationship, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Sanders on Tuesday evening, part of a series of overtures the Clinton campaign has been making to Mr. Sanders as the race nears the end.In an interview, Mrs. Clinton said: ""I called him to really express my appreciation and congratulate him on running a hard-fought and very determined campaign that I thought added a lot to the Democratic Party and to our debate in the country.""---Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Carol E.

Bernie Should Hold Out,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794722982?accountid=12768,"There is a reason why Hillary Clinton's milestone as the U.S.'s first female presidential nominee is having trouble reaching elevation. The reason is that her victory is not the most significant event of the Democratic primaries.The real claim to Democratic Party history belongs to Bernie Sanders. Sen. Sanders has recentered the Democrats, once and for all, as a party of the political left. He has reimagined the Democrats -- almost with the force of his personality -- as a party of the state, of government and of redistribution. Period.Barack Obama himself became a Bernista in his June 1 speech in Elkhart, Ind., when he essentially proposed delinking Social Security's benefits from any known economic reality.The party of Franklin Roosevelt through Lyndon Johnson and its alliance with private-sector industrial unions made Democrats aware that their fortunes ultimately were joined to the success of the private sector.The Democrats are now the party of Bernie Sanders, the progressive icon Sen. Elizabeth Warren and -- make no mistake -- of Barack Obama, a man of the left from day one. Rather than distrust the private sector, they disdain and even loathe it.In this milieu, Hillary Clinton was the odd woman out. If she'd had any credibility as an authentic member of the party's new Sanders-Warren center, she would have overwhelmed this obscure Vermont senator in the Iowa caucuses. Instead, liberals under 40, especially millennials, don't believe she is one of them.The policies of John Kennedy and Bill Clinton, now in disrepute, ensured that annual economic growth remained at its postwar average of about 3%. Those Democrats understood the private sector, even if they distrusted it.That understanding is gone, as proven by the seven-year Obama growth rate between zero and little more than 2%. If Hillary Clinton utters the phrase ""corporate tax reform,"" she will lose the election. The Sanders wing of the Obama coalition will walk away from her.In the new Democratic Party, defined by the substance of Sen. Sanders's campaign, the role of the private sector is to transmit revenue to the public purse. Private business has become an exotic abstraction, like the province of Cappadocia in the Roman empire.As the Obama presidency made clear, this new relationship is not based on the tax code, which the new Democrats think of as a kind of dumb sump pump. The driver now is legal prosecution or the constant threat of it by government enforcement agencies -- Justice, Labor, the NLRB, and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose originator was Elizabeth Warren.Ralph Nader this week told the Washington Post that Sen. Sanders had broken the taboo on the word ""socialism."" Bernie, said Mr. Nader, ""has brought the word into the mainstream and made class distinctions central to his campaign.""But not even Sen. Sanders uses the S-word much, preferring the euphemisms of ""income inequality"" and ""social justice,"" which are gentler on American ears. Mrs. Clinton will use most of the Sanders vocabulary.That said, many activists on the left believe, rightly, that they haven't gained permanent control of the party. They have its heart and soul, but the Sanders revolution doesn't yet command the power stations. Effective party power remains with what Sen. Sanders repeatedly calls the ""establishment.""But Bernie has something close to veto power. Sen. Sanders has disconnected Mrs. Clinton from most of the party's younger voters. They're listening to him, not her, and maybe not even to Barack Obama anymore. Indeed, one may ask whether the Democratic establishment abhorred by Sen. Sanders's base now includes Mr. Obama.All of which makes the scorpion dance over ""unifying the party"" between Sen. Sanders and bloodless Democratic heavyweights a show not to be missed.I am reminded of the Corleone family in ""The Godfather -- II"" when Tom Hagen tells Frankie Pentangeli it's time to go. I see Harry Reid as making the Hagen buyout offer to Bernie.Tom Hagen: ""When a plot against the emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.Frankie Pentangeli: ""Yeah, but only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off.""But Bernie isn't in Frankie Pentangeli's bathtub by himself. A whole generation of young Democratic voters -- who see Hillary and what she represents as the moribund empire and themselves as the little guys -- will be watching the deal the party offers to make Bernie go.Bernie's brigades should hold out for more than writing platform boilerplate. If Sen. Sanders forced Hillary to pick Elizabeth Warren as her running mate, it would be the capstone to Bernie's career. History would record him as someone who decisively shifted the locus of a major American party, rather than just another eccentric candidate who briefly caught fire.Plus, we'd get the spectacle of Donald Trump battling two women, not least Sen. Warren, progressivism's central processing unit.We are all in a five-month skydive, so it might as well be fun. Even for Bernie Sanders.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",8/23/16
Sanders Camp Is Split Over Next Step,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793856272?accountid=12768,"A split is emerging inside the Bernie Sanders campaign over whether the senator should stand down after Tuesday's election contests and unite behind Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, or take the fight all the way to the July party convention and try to pry the nomination from her.One camp might be dubbed the Sandersistas, the loyalists who helped guide Mr. Sanders's political ascent in Vermont and the U.S. Congress and are loath to give up a fight that has far surpassed expectations. Another has ties not only to Mr. Sanders but to the broader interests of a Democratic Party pining to beat back the challenge from Republican Donald Trump and make gains in congressional elections.Mr. Sanders in recent weeks has made clear he aims to take his candidacy past the elections on Tuesday, when California, New Jersey and four other states vote. But the debate within the campaign indicates that Mr. Sanders's next move isn't settled.For now, Democratic officials, fund-raisers and operatives are getting impatient, calling on Mr. Sanders to quit the race and begin thework of unifying the party for the showdown with the Republican presumptive nominee.Orin Kramer, a New York hedge-fund manager who has raised campaign funds for both President Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton, said with respect to Mr. Sanders's future plans: ""I would hope people would understand what a Trump presidency would mean and act accordingly -- and 'accordingly' means quickly.""A strong showing in New Jersey on Tuesday, before California results even come in, could help Mrs. Clinton reach the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Her total includes hundreds of superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials who can back either candidate. Mr. Sanders is hoping that defeating Mrs. Clinton in the most populous state later Tuesday might give superdelegates reason to drop her and get behind his candidacy. Those superdelegates have given no indication they will shift allegiances.Even so, Mr. Sanders isn't backing off. In an interview that airedSundayon CNN, he stepped up an attack on Mrs. Clinton involving the Clinton Foundation. Echoing a critique made by Republicans, Mr. Sanders said he has ""a problem"" with the foundation accepting money from foreign sources during her service as secretary of state.In a news conference Saturday in California, Mr. Sanders indicated he would battle for superdelegates all the way to the convention.""The Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton, who won Puerto Rico's Democratic primary on Sunday, seems to be running out of patience with Mr. Sanders. Having shifted her focus to Mr. Trump, she told CNN that afterTuesday, ""I'm going to do everything I can to reach out to try to unify the Democratic Party, and I expect Sen. Sanders to do the same.""When she ran against Mr. Obama in 2008, Mrs. Clinton stayed in the race until the end. As late as the final week of voting, she was talking hopefully of wooing super-delegates and capturing the nomination. But on June 7of that year -- four days after the primary season ended -- she gave a speech bowing out and immediately threw her support to Mr. Obama.Tad Devine, a senior Sanders strategist who advised Democratic nominees Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, among others, suggested the ""path forward"" is uncertain, hinging on the outcome in California and other states. He voiced a conciliatory note, describing how the two campaigns might set aside differences that have grown more pronounced in the heat of the year-long campaign.""What will happen hopefully when the voting is done, our two campaigns will begin to talk once more to one another and figure out where the common ground is,"" he said.Campaign manager Jeff Weaver, who has worked in Mr. Sanders's congressional offices and Vermont-based campaigns dating to the mid-1980s, takes a more aggressive approach.A victory in California and elsewhereon Tuesday would ""strengthen"" the argument for the nomination, Mr. Weaver said, but it isn't necessary to keep the candidacy alive through the convention.""The plan is as the senator has described it: to go forward after Tuesday and keep the campaign going to the convention and make the case to superdelegates that Sen. Sanders is the best chance that Democrats have to beat Trump,"" Mr. Weaver said.That is what worries Democratic leaders. Pointing to polls indicating a tightening race in November, they say Mr. Sanders, if he is sincere about beating back Mr. Trump, must quickly join forces with the party front-runner.""Democrats will need as much unity as early as we can get it as possible,"" said Tom Daschle, a former Senate Democratic leader. ""It would be a huge mistake to underestimate [Mr. Trump]. We've done that the entire election season.""Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid has concluded Mr. Sanders has no path to the nomination, an aide said, and that he should shift focus to helping Democrats pick up Senate seats. Doing so would help Mr. Sanders return to the chamber with more power than he wielded before the presidential race began a year ago, the aide said.William Daley, who chaired Mr. Gore's presidential campaign and served as a White House chief of staff for Mr. Obama, said in an interview the ""damage"" Mr. Sanders could do is ""overwhelming if he doesn't give [Mrs. Clinton] the breather she needs in the run-up to the convention to take on Trump.""At a minimum, some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters would like to see Mr. Sanders lay off the attacks. Alan Kessler, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, said Mr. Sanders's tone is ""a little disappointing.""""There's no reason why he shouldn't fight for the things that he's talking about, but there's no need to continually make it personal,"" he added.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",8/23/16
Election 2016: Sanders Hints at Endgame,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795448378?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday vowed to compete in the final Democratic presidential primary next week in Washington, D.C., but also hinted that he was ready to wind down his candidacy as party officials rallied behind Hillary Clinton.Mr. Sanders spent the day in Washington, meeting privately with President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Senate colleagues. Party leaders urged him to accept defeat and help unite Democrats for the general-election showdown with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama congratulated and complimented Mr. Sanders on his campaign. Mr. Earnest called it ""a friendly conversation that was focused on the future."" An hour after the Oval Office visit, Mr. Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton in a video released by her campaign.In another sign the party is coalescing around Mrs. Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a hero of the liberal Democratic wing, endorsed the former secretary of state Thursday evening in an interview on MSNBC. Ms. Warren's endorsement might prove particularly valuable to Mrs. Clinton, given her credibility with the young, liberal voters who gravitated toward Mr. Sanders.Before California and five other states voted Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said he would carry his fight to the party's national convention next month in Philadelphia, trying to flip superdelegates loyal to Mrs. Clinton. After losses in California, New Jersey and two other states that day, Mr. Sanders seems to be rethinking that stance.After meeting with Mr. Obama, the Vermont senator went to Capitol Hill for an hourlong session with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Mr. Reid suggested to reporters afterward that Mr. Sanders accepts that the race is over. ""I didn't hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she is the nominee,"" Mr. Reid said.A House member who had endorsed Mr. Sanders, Peter Welch of Vermont, said Thursday he believes Mr. Sanders grasps that he has lost and won't try to change the minds of superdelegates. ""It's clear that Hillary Clinton is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party,"" Mr. Welch said in an interview. ""We all know that. Sen. Sanders knows that.""Speaking briefly to reporters outside the White House, Mr. Sanders didn't say he planned to drop out. But neither did he speak of Mrs. Clinton as a competitor, emphasizing that he planned to meet with her ""in the near future to see how we can work together to defeat Donald Trump and to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1%.""Democratic officials are treating Mr. Sanders with care. They need his help in the general election and don't wish to antagonize him as he comes to terms with the outcome of the primary contest.For his part, Mr. Reid praised the energy that Mr. Sanders brought to the campaign trail and empathized with the candidate.""During the conversation, I said, 'Bernie, I don't understand the depth of your feelings, but I have some understanding,'"" Mr. Reid said, describing the loss of a 1974 Senate race early in his career by only hundreds of votes.After seeing Mr. Reid, Mr. Sanders met privately with Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is presumed to become the Senate Democratic leader when Mr. Reid retires at the end of the congressional session. ""I told him I was proud of him and what he accomplished,"" Mr. Schumer said.At a rally outside Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington Thursday evening, Mr. Sanders gave his normal stump speech, focusing on issues of income inequality and criminal-justice reform. In a notable departure from past speeches, he backed off any criticism of Mrs. Clinton. He didn't mention her name or discuss his future plans.---Carol E.

How Millennials Can Live Bernie's Dream,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795403190?accountid=12768,"They backed him over Hillary Clinton in greater numbers than they backed Barack Obama over John McCain. But now, millions of millennials are left licking their wounds after the defeat of Bernie Sanders, the greatest progressive hero since the president he wanted to replace.Many of them recoil at the thought of supporting Mrs. Clinton, a liberal but one with insufficient anticapitalist bona fides. For now, the Bernie-backers' dream of grafting Scandinavian solutions onto American problems is dead.Or is it? Despite some recent budgetary setbacks, a long-running American experiment in socialism is still going strong, and yet somehow it remains one of the country's best-kept secrets.The federal experiment involves 1.3 million Americans -- less than 1% of the population, but 75% of the participants are themselves millennials, so Bernie's supporters should feel right at home. Unless they feel like they've arrived in socialist heaven. Consider:These lucky few, including their spouses and children, receive free single-payer health care. Pre-existing conditions? No problem. Prescriptions? Generally free.Bernie only proposed free college for all; that's already a reality for these young Americans. Local elementary schooling for their children is also tossed in at no cost. Vocational training? When do you want to start? And put your wallet away.What's more, the federal government provides these participants with generous living allowances. On top of their normal salaries, they collect a monthly allowance for rent or mortgage payments, an allowance for moving costs incurred when their job location changes, and an allowance for gas consumed when driving for work-related purposes. There's even a clothing allowance. Oh, none of these allowances is taxable. Did I mention that tax preparation services are also free?In case you thought it couldn't get any more Nordic for these chosen few, they get 30 days of paid vacation a year in addition to the usual 10 paid federal holidays. That's 40 days of paid leave every year -- more than in the Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.These Americans are also eligible for a lifetime pension. If they enter the program after high school, they can start collecting their retirement -- half the dollar amount of their final salary, every year for the rest of their life -- at age 38! Not even Bernie thought of that. The amount they collect is calculated annually according to the Consumer Price Index and the effects of inflation, so the pension payments increase each year as the cost of living rises.Speaking of salaries: No gender pay gap here. A male who occupies the same position with the same experience cannot earn more than his female colleague. That's the rule, not subject to the whim of a paymaster.So come on over, disappointed young Bernie fans. Someone's already living your dream. There is one catch: Occasionally the program can get a bit dangerous, and you'll be beyond the reach of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Welcome to the U.S. Armed Forces, my fellow millennials. Feel the burn?---Mr. Stern is a lieutenant in the U.S. Army.Credit: By Jeremy Stern",8/24/16
Main Street: Bernie 'Wins' California,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794079329?accountid=12768,"Could Bernie Sanders really defeat Hillary Clinton in California?The question has been dominating the news coverage, because the socialist senator from Vermont is now locked in a statistical dead heat with the former secretary of state as Californians get ready to make their pick in Tuesday's Democratic primary. Though a Sanders upset in California would not likely deprive Mrs. Clinton of the nomination, it would leave her limping into what her rival insists will be a contested convention.For the American people, the more salient point is this: When it comes to economics, Bernie Sanders won California a long time ago. The senator's progressive pieties and obsessions are more or less California's pieties and obsessions. And there's the rub, because the great cautionary tale of progressivism is that you have to be fairly rich to enjoy the benefits.Joel Kotkin, a presidential fellow at Chapman University and the executive director of the Center for Opportunity Urbanism, calls California's progressive economy the ""new feudalism.""""In practice,"" Mr. Kotkin says, ""it makes upward mobility very difficult and hurts the very people it claims to help.""If a May 25 Field Poll is to be believed, Bernie's popularity with California Democrats shouldn't be any surprise. Though both Democrats and Republicans rank jobs and the economy as their top concern, from there they go in much different directions. Indeed, likely Democratic voters list among their top 10 priorities ""climate change, income inequality, college affordability, equal pay for women, ensuring clean air/water, and keeping the U.S. out of war.""Sure sounds like Bernie. Here it's not just talk, either. From the new $15-an-hour state minimum wage to the war on greenhouse gases to the imposition of the nation's highest top marginal income-tax rate, the Bernie agenda has blossomed in California.Gov. Jerry Brown admitted as much last week. At the same time he endorsed Mrs. Clinton, he spoke warmly of Bernie's war on ""the one percent,"" saying it reminded him of his own campaign for president back in 1992.Though he failed at the national level, in California Mr. Brown today presides over a tax code right out of a Bernie Sanders dream. The governor took one of America's most progressive tax codes and made it even more top-heavy -- with a ""temporary"" (we'll see about that) tax hike that jacked the state's top marginal tax rate to 13.3%.As a result, the wealthiest 1% of Californians today pay half the state's income taxes despite accounting for only about a quarter of its income. State tax revenues are up, state unemployment is down and jobs now exceed prerecession levels.In the process Mr. Brown has been transformed from Governor Moonbeam to the Practical Progressive. The accolades have been quick in coming: Rolling Stone (""Jerry Brown's Tough-Love California Miracle""); Newsweek (""How Jerry Brown Quietly Saved California""); the Nation (""How Jerry Brown Got Californians to Raise Their Taxes and Save Their State""); well, you get the picture.So what's not to like?Answer: a downturn.For notwithstanding the headlines about how today's California refutes Republican scaremongering on taxes and regulation, California's state funding structure remains as precarious as ever. Because California is so dependent on individuals and capital gains, the moment there's a downturn in the stock market, all the old problems will come roaring back.Even now California's economic boom is masking some hard realities, especially for those on the lower rungs of society whose cause Mr. Sanders professes to champion.Most glaring of all is housing. In California, only the very wealthy can afford what was once deemed the essence of the American dream: a home of your own. When the cost of housing is factored in, moreover, it turns out California has the highest poverty rate in the nation.Today progressives crow that there's no evidence the rich are fleeing California's high marginal tax rates. But is it a progressive achievement that people of more modest means are being driven out of the state by housing prices that are themselves being driven up by California's no-build mentality? Is it a victory for the little guy that, for those without a bachelor's degree or an annual income of at least $50,000, California now has more people moving out than moving in?It's partly for these reasons the Hoover Institution's Carson Bruno says that the so-called California comeback should really be called ""Silicon Valley holding up the rest of the state."" Meaning that if you confine your gaze to this high-tech oasis of wealth, weather and well-being, it's easy to feel the Bern.Point is, whoever emerges at the top of California's Democratic primary, Mr. Sanders has already won the argument. And the folks paying the highest price for this progressive victory are those who can't afford a Volvo to put their Bernie stickers on.Credit: By William McGurn",8/26/16
"Election 2016: Clinton Seeks Sanders Backing, Voter List --- Rival still not ready to endorse former secretary of state as she wins final primary",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796453031?accountid=12768,"The Democratic presidential race officially came to an end Tuesday with Hillary Clinton winning the primary in the District of Columbia, and now the negotiations with her rival Bernie Sanders begin in earnest.Mrs. Clinton wants Mr. Sanders to endorse her for president and deploy his email list to persuade his supporters to unite behind her, campaign advisers say, in hopes of bridging differences within the party and leaving Democrats best positioned to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the general election.But for now, Mr. Sanders is withholding his endorsement as he presses Mrs. Clinton and Democratic leaders to agree to some of the liberal policy goals and electoral changes he touted on the campaign trail.The two met Tuesday night at a hotel near the White House as the votes were being counted in the last of the 57 Democratic contests. In similarly worded statements later, they said they had a positive discussion about how to unify the party, bring more people into the political process ""and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation.""The two, joined by top campaign aides and Jane Sanders, the candidate's wife, also discussed the Democratic Party platform, which Mr. Sanders wants to tilt in a more liberal direction. ""Sanders and Clinton agreed to continue working to develop a progressive agenda that addresses the needs of working families and the middle class and adopting a progressive platform for the Democratic National Convention,"" the Sanders statement said.Tuesday's Washington, D.C., primary results -- Clinton posted a 79% to 21% win -- had no practical effect on the race. With a combination of 2,784 pledged and superdelegates ahead of the result, Mrs. Clinton already had become the party's presumptive nominee, having easily cleared the 2,383 delegate threshold.While Sanders aides say his campaign is still ""active,"" they indicated that he accepts the mathematical realities and understands he can no longer wrest the nomination from Mrs. Clinton. Speaking outside a campaign office in Washington earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders called for the ouster of Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, depicting her as more focused on raising campaign funds than expanding the party and imbuing it with fresh energy.""We need a person at the leadership of the DNC who is vigorously supporting and out working to bring people into the political process,"" he said.Ms. Wasserman Schultz told MSNBC Tuesday she wouldn't step down.Mr. Sanders, who identified as an independent until entering the presidential race, also called for the elimination of superdelegates -- the hundreds of party leaders and elected officials who have an outsize influence on the nomination. Party officials created the superdelegate system to head off debacles such as Democratic Sen. George McGovern's landslide defeat in 1972. The idea is that superdelegates could intervene should voters produce a nominee seen as unelectable.Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) took part in a meeting at Mr. Sanders's home in Burlington, Vt., over the weekend to talk about his next steps.""He wants to spend a lot of time thinking about how to drive forward this agenda, to basically take on the big issues facing America,"" Mr. Merkley said in an interview.Clinton aides seem willing to accommodate Mr. Sanders up to a point. But they also stress it's incumbent on him to help mobilize his supporters. One step they see as helpful is Mr. Sanders using his email list to help make the case for victory over Mr. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump in recent polls, and was up by more than four points in the average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics.Mr. Sanders will be speaking to supporters via video message on Thursday evening to discuss his political future. ""I told you that I run not to oppose any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching policies to deal with the crises of our time,"" he said in a statement. ""After June 14, the voting is done, but our political revolution continues.""Both candidates campaigned in the city in advance of the primary campaign, and touted their support for D.C. statehood, which would give city residents full representation in Congress.Mr. Sanders held a rally outside of RFK Stadium, drawing a large crowd. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton visited a muffin shop in the city's rapidly developing Shaw neighborhood, flanked by city council members Jack Evans and Anita Bonds, as well as Washington's nonvoting delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton.---Julian Routh contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau",8/29/16

""I'm so discouraged about the moment we're in right now,"" Ms. Scott said. ""I am distraught that the two choices that I get are two people who do not represent me and do not represent the things that I need.""While some Sanders supporters are rallying around the presumptive Democratic nominee -- including the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor coalition -- resistance from his most ardent backers threatens to split the party ahead of the showdown with Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders wasn't at the conference. But the Vermont senator was everywhere all the same. Millennials walked through the halls wearing T-shirts bearing sketches of his receding hairline. In panels, participants dissected the campaign's rise and fall and talked about how close Mr. Sanders came to vanquishing Mrs. Clinton.The conference's lead organizer was National Nurses United. Among the 3,000 attendees were assorted socialists, union officials, community organizers and college students. Together, they represent the wing of the Sanders coalition least enthused about coalescing behind the Clinton campaign.""It's a terrible place we find ourselves in,"" said Becky Bond, a former adviser to Mr. Sanders's campaign, in a session titled ""Understanding our Movement Moment."" The best a Clinton presidency would produce is a nation ""slightly worse than it is under Obama,"" Ms. Bond said.What worries some at the conference is the fate of Mr. Sanders's email list. Seeing the list as a coveted asset, his supporters want Mr. Sanders to use it to promote like-minded candidates. Clinton aides want him to use the list to tout her candidacy. Rosario Dawson, an actress who campaigned for Mr. Sanders and attended the conference, said: ""If she wants our vote, then she needs to go get it,"" she said.A conference theme was that the movement that propelled Mr. Sanders doesn't need him to endure. A new goal, they said, is finding candidates who will push for the policy changes he championed, including a government-run health-care system.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",8/30/16
Election 2016: Sanders Not Being Vetted for Running Mate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797031460?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's campaign isn't considering primary rival Bernie Sanders as her running mate, but is actively looking at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose populist politics line up closely with Mr. Sanders, people familiar with the process said.The vetting remains in its early stages. So far, potential candidates have been scrutinized using publicly available information. The Clinton team hasn't asked anyone to submit tax returns or other personal information, one of the people said. Conversations with Mrs. Clinton herself about options are just now beginning.Beyond the Massachusetts senator, other prospective candidates include Labor Secretary Tom Perez; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Cory Booker of New Jersey; Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and Reps. Xavier Becerra of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio, several Democrats said.Asked Tuesday if she would consider Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton told Telemundo, ""I haven't even begun to sort all that out."" She added, ""There are a lot of really qualified, dynamic candidates, I'm sure, to be considered for vice president.""The search process is being led by John Podesta, the campaign chairman. Longtime Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills also is an informal adviser.Many Sanders supporters, disappointed by his failure to win the nomination, have held out hope that Mrs. Clinton would pick the Vermont senator in a show of unity and a signal that she will chart a progressive course if elected.At a board meeting of Friends of the Earth Action last week that included senior Sanders advisers, several board members said Mr. Sanders should receive serious consideration as Mrs. Clinton's running mate, said Erich Pica, president of the environmental group. Their argument, he said, was that he has brought ideas and energy to the debate.Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser who was there, replied that Mr. Sanders would be a ""powerful voice"" and a major national figure from his Senate perch, Mr. Cohen confirmed.Mr. Sanders isn't particularly interested in the job, nor is he expecting to be offered it, though he doesn't mind being part of the conversation, a senior Sanders adviser said. He sees himself as exercising his strongest influence in the Senate, where his profile is sure to be elevated following his presidential run, the adviser said.The two camps are now in talks about how to unify the Democratic Party, with the Sanders forces pushing for changes in party rules and installing liberal policies in its platform at the July convention in Philadelphia.Mr. Sanders plans a video address to supporters Thursday night, but isn't expected to formally endorse Mrs. Clinton there, an aide said.Mrs. Clinton's top priority is finding someone who is prepared to step in as president, she has said. She also is looking for a working partner who can help advance her agenda, and her advisers are less concerned with demographic and geographic factors, people familiar with the process said.Some Sanders backers are encouraging her to pick someone from the more liberal wing of the party. ""I would certainly encourage consideration of Bernie and other folks who represent the progressive side,"" said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), the only senator to back Mr. Sanders during the primary fight. Mr. Merkley also mentioned Ms. Warren and Mr. Brown.Mrs. Clinton doesn't feel pressured to go that route, since she already embraced such progressive positions as a large increase in the minimum wage and a plan to guarantee debt-free tuition at public universities, a senior strategist said.Clinton officials said they've been impressed by Ms. Warren's sharp critique of Republican Donald Trump, and they've made a point to highlight her endorsement along with those of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.Mr. Brown also appears to be under consideration, although if he were elected, Ohio's Republican governor would appoint his successor, which could impact control of the Senate. One person familiar with the process said this is a factor in considering him, but said every candidate brings some sort of wrinkle.---Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",8/30/16
"Election 2016: Sanders Positioning Himself for New Role --- Now that Clinton has locked up nomination, he presses Democrats to embrace his goals",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797509290?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders said he would work feverishly to defeat Republican Donald Trump in November's presidential election, urged his volunteers to run for elective office and said he would press his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to embrace a liberal policy agenda.But he neither endorsed Mrs. Clinton nor announced he was ending his campaign in a 23-minute speech to his supporters Thursday night, moves that might have drained his leverage in trying to shape the Democratic Party's future. He made plain that one of his overriding goals is to bring about Mr. Trump's defeat.""The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly,"" he said as he spoke in an internet address against a simple blue backdrop with his campaign logo. ""And I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time."" His campaign said there were 218,000 viewers over the length of the address.The Clinton campaign declined to comment about the Sanders speech.Mr. Sanders's plans have been a bit of a mystery since Mrs. Clinton last week secured the delegates making her the presumptive Democratic nominee.The address offered few new insights. His tone was somewhat wistful, celebrating a campaign that far surpassed expectations but fell short in the end. He noted that he won 22 state primaries and caucuses, saying ""we came very close -- within two points or less -- in five more states.""What's clear is Mr. Sanders has accepted defeat and has given up plans to wrest the nomination from Mrs. Clinton. His new agenda, he said, is to transform the political system and open the Democratic Party to new voters and push it in a leftward direction.He mentioned his private meeting earlier this week with Mrs. Clinton, in which the two began discussing ways to bridge differences. ""I look forward, in the coming weeks to continued discussions between the two campaigns to make certain that your voices are heard and that the Democratic Party passes the most progressive platform in its history and that Democrats actually fight for that agenda,"" he said.Looking ahead, he said he wants his campaign supporters to be at the vanguard of a 50-state strategy that would reverse Republican gains in statehouses and local offices.He urged viewers to visit his website and see how ""you can effectively run for office or get involved in politics at the local or state level.""Ahead of the speech, many Sanders supporters were divided about his future. Some want to see him stay in the race and fight for the nomination at the convention next month in Philadelphia. Others are moving on, rallying behind Mrs. Clinton.""His base is looking for signals about where he's going, what he's doing and what he's thinking,"" said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union that has been among Mr. Sanders's most ardent supporters. ""People are looking to Bernie for direction.""Having locked up the nomination, Mrs. Clinton's campaign began putting its imprint on the Democratic National Committee on Thursday, installing Brandon Davis as general election chief of staff. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook visited the DNC headquarters in Washington, D.C., to introduce Mr. Davis, who had been national political director for the Service Employees International Union. The union endorsed Mrs. Clinton last year.Not wanting to antagonize Sanders supporters, the DNC won't immediately recast itself as an arm of the campaign, a Clinton adviser said. Campaign officials are treating Mr. Sanders and his supporters carefully, hoping to win them over and unite the party for the general election fight against Mr. Trump.Still, the Vermont senator doesn't have unlimited time to readjust. With each day, his leverage diminishes as the party coalesces behind Mrs. Clinton. The AFL-CIO, a coalition of labor unions that represents 12.5 million members, had been split during the primary; on Thursday, it endorsed the former secretary of state.Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.), an early Sanders supporter, said Thursday he wants to see the party unify and now backs Mrs. Clinton.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",8/31/16
"Broadway Veteran Tapped to Produce Mall Entertainment; Tony Award-winning producer Scott Sanders to create 'unique and spectacular' events, while still juggling his Broadway projects",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815535584?accountid=12768,"An international retail giant is poaching some razzle-dazzle from Broadway.Westfield Corp., the Australian shopping-center company with 35 malls including lower Manhattan's Westfield World Trade C enter , has tapped Broadway producer Scott Sanders to lead its entertainment offerings.Mr. Sanders, who won a Tony Award this year with his revival of ""The Color Purple,"" will have the official title of creative head of global entertainment.And the role will include thinking broadly about performances to create ""unique and spectacular events,"" he said, possibly including music, dance, food and fashion.He will continue to work on his Broadway projects in development, including stage adaptations of ""Tootsie"" and ""Coal Miner's Daughter.""The new role comes as brick-and-mortar retailers are scrambling to create new reasons for consumers to shop in stores instead of online, said Mark Hunter, managing director of retail asset services for CBRE Group Inc., a commercial real-estate-services and investment firm.""They are not only competing against other retail property owners,"" said Mr. Hunter. ""They are also competing against e-commerce for the attention and spending dollars of consumers.""Mr. Sanders, 59 years old, comes armed for the task with experience in TV and film, plus 15 years at Radio City Music Hall presenting and producing major acts from Madonna to Sting, as well as Michael Jackson's 1993 Super Bowl halftime show.While Broadway elements could be part of the mix, Mr. Sanders said the intent is not to transplant shows into the flagship shopping centers. Instead, they will shoot for more unusual concepts, including overhead stage platforms and immersive theater, in the style of ""Here Lies love,"" the rock musical created by David Byrne and Fatboy Slim.""The audience moved with the cast,"" he said of the 360-degree show about the life of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos.Not long before hiring Mr. Sanders, Westfield opened its lower Manhattan shopping center , within the Santiago Calatrava-designed Oculus , with a slate of more traditional performances by singer-songwriter John Legend, Tony-winning actor Leslie Odom Jr. and the cast of the musical ""School of Rock.""""Events and entertainment are going to be huge part of what happens here at Westfield World Trade Center,"" said Westfield co-chief executive Steven Lowy at the event.As for moving some of those Westfield shoppers up to the Theater District, Mr. Sanders said there could be opportunities for cross promotion: ""The demographic sits right in the Broadway sweet spot. It is a very similar person.""Write to Pia Catton at pia.catton@wsj.comRelated* Shopping Malls' New Product: Fun* Under Oculus, Retail Takes a Bow* Upscale Shopping Centers Nudge Out Down-Market Malls* Mall Landlords Embrace High-Tech to Entice ShoppersCredit: By Pia Catton",9/1/16
Election 2016: Sanders Prods Party To Change Its Rules,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797653058?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders is winding down his presidential run by pushing for changes to Democratic Party rules that could assist an insurgent campaign like his own in the next presidential election.The Vermont lawmaker is eager to influence the party's platform, which will be approved at the Democratic National Convention next month in Philadelphia. He is pushing for free tuition at public colleges, a $15 federal minimum wage, a carbon tax and other positions where he and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton disagree.But the Sanders campaign also wants the party to adopt changes to how it governs itself. While party platforms are typically forgotten soon after they are approved, the party rules will affect how the next presidential contest is run.""We need major, major changes in the Democratic Party in converting it to a party of the people,"" Mr. Sanders said this week. ""We need an electoral process which is worthy of the Democrats.""Specifically, he wants to get rid of superdelegates, the party leaders and elected officials who get to vote for whomever they like for the party's nomination. He wants all presidential primaries to be open to independent voters, and not just to registered Democrats, and for the party to encourage candidates to reject support in primaries from super PACs, the outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money.Those issues are fodder for talks under way with the Clinton campaign. For now, Mr. Sanders remains an ""active candidate"" for the nomination, said his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, Friday on MSNBC.Clinton aides suggest the two campaigns will overcome their differences. For instance, while Mr. Sanders backs a $15 federal minimum wage and Mrs. Clinton backs a $12 level, they both want to see an increase from the current $7.25. There may be language both candidates can agree to.The rules changes are more complicated. Rules governing primaries, for instance, are set by states. The national party could encourage changes by awarding extra delegates to states that make changes.Other changes are complicated by the egos and preferences of hundreds of party leaders. That is particularly true of superdelegates, a role created to make sure party leaders had some control over the presidential nomination.The superdelegates have never taken the nomination away from someone who won in the primaries and caucuses, but the Sanders forces believe they exercise an undue influence. Before any votes were cast, Mrs. Clinton had a large delegate lead thanks to her support among superdelegates, and Mr. Sanders and his supporters say this gave her an air of inevitability.In the end, Mrs. Clinton beat him by nearly 400 pledged delegates, the type chosen by the voters. Among the 713 superdelegates, she has 581, with 49 for Mr. Sanders, according to an Associated Press tally.Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser who is a superdelegate, said one possibility is to give these elected officials and party leaders floor passes to the convention but not allow them to vote. That would allow them to participate without having to run for one of their state's delegate spots.Credit: By Laura Meckler",9/1/16
Election 2016: No Endorsement From Sanders Yet,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799324678?accountid=12768,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday that he would vote for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November, but declined to endorse her for now, saying he is waiting until she says what he wants to hear on a number of issues.Mr. Sanders's back-to-back television interviews underscored the position he and Mrs. Clinton are in as they negotiate about the Democratic Party's platform. She wants him to get behind her campaign and help move his supporters to her corner. He wants her to move closer to his positions in areas where they have disagreed.For now, Mr. Sanders is struggling with how to answer questions about his intentions. On MSNBC, Mr. Sanders was asked directly if he would vote for Mrs. Clinton this fall. ""Yes,"" he said. He added that he would do ""everything I can to defeat Donald Trump,"" saying that he would be a disaster in ""so many ways"" if he were elected.Afterwards, when asked by email if Mr. Sanders's comment amounted to an endorsement, a spokesman replied, ""No."" And in a separate interview on CBS on Friday, Mr. Sanders made clear he wasn't endorsing her now.When pressed why he hasn't endorsed her, he said, ""Because I have not heard her say the things that I think need to be said."" He said he wants her to back tuition-free public college -- she wants debt-free; to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour -- she backs $12; and a single-payer health-care system that he supports and she doesn't.""We're talking,"" he said. Asked if he would be prepared to endorse her before next month's Democratic National Convention, he added, ""I would hope that that would happen, or it may not happen.""The Clinton campaign didn't return a request for comment.Democratic strategists said Mr. Sanders's refusal to endorse his party's presumptive nominee could weaken his credibility going forward, while having little effect on Mrs. Clinton.""It's going to hurt him more than it hurts her,"" said Democratic strategist Mark Mellman. Mr. Sanders's comments make him sound ""churlish,"" he said. ""Closing out that way lowers the esteem in which people hold him and lowers the influence he's going to have in the Senate.""Mr. Mellman said the senator's refusal to endorse Mrs. Clinton was unlikely to have a major effect on the former secretary of state, saying Sanders backers would vote for the nominee over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. ""Bernie's supporters, as much or more than Hillary's supporters, detest Donald Trump, and they're not going to have it on their conscience that they helped elect him,"" he said.When asked Friday if his refusal to withdraw from the race is leading to disunity in the party, Mr. Sanders said that wasn't his top concern.""You talk about disunity, I talk about involving the American people in the political process and wanting to have a government and a party that represents all of us,"" he said.Bill Burton, a Democratic strategist and former aide to President Barack Obama, said Mr. Sanders withholding his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton won't be a factor for long. ""Sanders still has an opportunity to get media attention; but not long after the convention, the number of phone calls he gets from reporters and cable bookers will rapidly decline . . . to the point of this issue being irrelevant in not too long,"" he said.Added strategist Steve Elmendorf: ""I think we know where he's going to end up.""---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Julian Routh and Laura Meckler",9/7/16
The Democrats' Bernie Sanders Schism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800287518?accountid=12768,"One of this year's dominant news stories is how Donald Trump has roiled the GOP. Yet Democrats face an internal rupture that may be larger and more durable. That is my takeaway after reading "" "" the New Republic's extraordinary June 14 symposium of liberal activists, historians, intellectuals, political scientists, pollsters and writers.""The schism between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is knit into the DNA of the modern Democratic Party,"" writes historian Rick Perlstein. In 1924, he recounts, Klan supporters in the party's rightward wing dominated the Democratic convention. In 1937 opponents of FDR opposed the New Deal. ""Hillary Clinton's eagerness to please Wall Street,"" he writes, ""can be traced, in part, to that ideological split.""Yale professor Jacob Hacker says that President Obama's failure to govern as a hard leftist heightened these tensions. ""There's a sense,"" he writes, ""that supporting the Democratic establishment and going the conventional route hasn't been that productive."" Duke Law professor Jedediah Purdy adds that the president promised ""transformative politics"" but didn't deliver ""the substance.""The critique of Mr. Obama sometimes sounds vaguely Republican: ""The Democratic Party today engages in delusional happy talk about economic recovery,"" complains Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, ""while a staggering 47 million Americans are struggling in poverty."" By contrast, writer and left-wing activist Mychal Denzel Smith says young Democrats are unhappy with ""the ways economic inequality persists,"" and activist Astra Taylor bemoans the Democrats' failure to follow through on the vision of Occupy Wall Street.Some of the symposium's participants also attack Bill Clinton. Mr. Smith doesn't name the former president but suggests that his anticrime bill sustains ""systemic, institutionalized racism."" Mr. Perlstein adds that ""Bill and Hillary Clinton won the White House with the business-funded support of the Democratic Leadership Council, which sought to downplay the 'big government' solutions championed by FDR."" At least, political scientist Ruy Teixeira rejoices, today's Democrats are no longer ""obsessed with the national debt.""Mr. Purdy writes that Sanders supporters ""have no love for or confidence in elites, Hillary's habitus. And why should they? They've seen growing inequality and insecurity, the naked corruption of politics by oligarchic money, total cynicism in the political class."" Mr. Hacker says: ""This may be the first time in my life that there's been a full-throated critique of the Democratic Party as being excessively beholden to money and too willing to work within the system.""These disagreements are diminished for now by Mr. Trump. As Mark Green, former New York City public advocate, says, ""the programmatic differences"" between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton ""are dwarfed by the differences between either of them and the first proto-fascist president.""Still, the left's frustration over the lack of radical change is undeniable. Young and minority voters feel a keen sense of urgency. ""Clinton and the Democrats in Washington don't understand the level of anxiety that Americans, and particularly the young, feel about their economic prospects,"" writes journalist John Judis.If Mrs. Clinton wins, Mr. Hacker hopes for ""a true grassroots, longer-term movement that tries to move the center of gravity of American politics to the left."" And if she wins and ignores ""the issues Sanders has raised,"" Ms. Taylor warns, then she risks ""losing a huge swath of the Democratic electorate for years.""In any event, expect another insurgent in 2020, writes University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci: ""Digital fund-raising, organizing, and messaging have given the left the weapons not just to tilt at the establishment's windmills, but to come close to toppling them. Next time, they might just succeed.""That seems to be the outcome Mr. Sanders intends to facilitate. Anyone who thinks the Democratic Party's left will stand down soon should consult Sunday about the party's platform. He criticized the platform committee for voting down planks opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, supporting a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, and proposing a carbon tax and a fracking ban.Having already criticized the existence of Democratic superdelegates and the Clintons' dependence on Wall Street largess, Mr. Sanders is laying down more markers that could serve as rallying points for an insurgent movement to disrupt the Democratic Party after November, win or (especially) lose.American politics is being convulsed, and neither party is immune. When the dust settles, the parties could look very different--especially the Democrats.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",9/19/16
Green Party Makes Inroads --- Pursuit of Sanders supporters threatens to siphon Democratic votes from Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800789615?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is aggressively courting disaffected supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, potentially undermining Democratic efforts to unify the party behind presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton.Ms. Stein, the presumptive Green Party nominee, has been making the case in interviews, rallies and appearances across the country that supporters of Mr. Sanders should consider casting a ballot for her in the fall, emphasizing the common agenda and progressive worldview they share.""We're picking up where Bernie left off. In fact, you could say we were here back in 2012 doing the same thing, long before Bernie's campaign,"" Ms. Stein said in an interview Friday.Ms. Stein, 66, said her campaign has seen an influx of interest since Mrs. Clinton was declared the presumptive Democratic Party nominee after she secured enough delegates to deny Mr. Sanders the nomination--a point buttressed by her rising poll numbers and spiking interest on Google searches.""For many people, we've been Plan B for when Bernie got shut down by the Democrats. And from my perspective, that's pretty much what was going to happen,"" she said, adding: ""It's hard to have a revolution in a counter-revolutionary party.""With Mrs. Clinton and her likely Republican rival Donald Trump two of the most unpopular nominees in history, polls have found a growing appetite for alternatives. The most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released this past week had Ms. Stein drawing 6% of the vote nationwide in a four-way matchup with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump, and Libertarian Gary Johnson.Ms. Stein's agenda calls for a higher minimum wage, a focus on renewable energy, better job security, universal health care and free education--all issues that Mr. Sanders has embraced. Their biggest contrast comes on foreign policy, where Ms. Stein has proposed massive defense cuts and disarmament.The poll also shows that 14% of self-identified supporters of Mr. Sanders are backing Ms. Stein, while 9% say they support Mr. Trump. Another 8% say they will support the Libertarian ticket.""Right now, she's definitely a landing spot for Sanders supporters who are not ready to commit to Clinton or don't like Clinton,"" said Tom Jensen, the polling director at the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling.Mr. Jensen said both the Green Party and Libertarian presidential tickets are unlikely to pull more than a few percentage points in the fall, but that margin could be a problem in tight swing states.""In a close race, you don't want to lose any support, of course. Just ask Al Gore, who might have been president if [Ralph] Nader had not taken votes from him,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama.In the 2000 presidential race, Mr. Nader, running as head of the Green Party, drew nearly 100,000 left-leaning votes in Florida, while Democratic nominee Mr. Gore lost the state by about 500 votes to Republican nominee George W. Bush.Mr. Nader has long objected to being called a spoiler, calling it a ""politically bigoted word"" in an interview this past week. ""Did Gore ever call Bush a spoiler? Why not? Didn't he take more votes away from Gore than I did?"" Mr. Nader said. ""I siphoned votes? How about Gore siphoning votes for me? Don't we have an equal right to run for election?""Ms. Stein, a Harvard-educated physician, first emerged on the political scene in Massachusetts in 2002, where she launched a bid for governor on the Green-Rainbow Party ticket. She got about 3% of the vote in a race won by future Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.She went on to run statewide in Massachusetts two more times, launching unsuccessful bids for secretary of the commonwealth in 2006 and governor in 2010. She won the Green Party presidential nomination in 2012 and drew about 479,000 votes nationwide after appearing on ballots in 36 states. This year, the party is aiming to be on the ballot in 47 states.Her current level of support in the poll would be double the Green Party's best-ever electoral showing at the presidential level, which was in 2000 when Mr. Nader, a consumer advocate, drew about 3% of the vote nationwide.In addition to rising poll numbers, Google searches for the terms ""third party candidate"" are at their highest level recorded, according to data compiled by the digital-marketing company iQuanti earlier this year.Search interest in ""independent"" or ""third party"" spiked in March as it became clearer that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were on track to be the nominees, the analysis showed. Google data show that search results for Ms. Stein have soared since April.Most alarming for Mrs. Clinton is that the third-party candidates appear to be cutting into her clear lead against Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton has a five-point lead in a head-to-head matchup against Mr. Trump in the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll. When the Libertarian and Green Party candidates are included, her lead declines to just one point.Her campaign declined to comment on Ms. Stein, as did Mr. Sanders's campaign.Many progressives--including Sanders supporters--see the 2016 race differently from the 2000 showdown, warning that a vote for Ms. Stein is essentially a vote for Mr. Trump.""The plan B for the political revolution that the Green Party seems to be pushing right now is the path to Chancellor Trump,"" said Neil Sroka, the communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America, which endorsed Mr. Sanders.Ms. Stein's campaign is planning a high-visibility appearance at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this month, where she will lead a march and host a rally.Ms. Stein extended an offer of collaboration with Mr. Sanders on the Green Party ticket, even floating the possibility that he could capture the Green Party nomination. She is only the presumptive nominee and won't officially be crowned until the party's August convention in Houston.""If he could actually make the case for why we need to have independent politics, I think it's quite likely that he could be given the Green Party nomination,"" she said, adding that she was willing to ""put all possibilities on the table,"" including a withdrawal from the race.""I'm a physician, not a politician. I'm concerned with healing our very sick political system, but I do not have a political career to establish for myself. That's not my goal here,"" she said.Activists loyal to Mr. Sanders say Ms. Stein is being seriously considered by those who feel they are unable to cast a ballot for Mrs. Clinton.""We are not going to vote for the demon named Hillary because they are threatening us with the devil named Trump. We will vote for a saint no matter what, and if that saint is not Bernie Sanders, then we will vote for the saint named Jill Stein,"" said Bill Taylor, a Philadelphia activist who is helping to plan four days of demonstrations in support of Mr. Sanders at the Democratic convention this month.Mr. Taylor said his group would be willing to offer Ms. Stein some time at the rallies and marches that the pro-Sanders forces have reserved at the convention.YahNé Ndgo, another Philadelphia activist and a spokeswoman for the Bernie or Bust movement, said: ""For a lot of people who are in the Bernie or Bust movement, Hillary Clinton is just as bad as Donald Trump. And for some people, Hillary Clinton is worse than Donald Trump.""Credit: By Byron Tau",9/21/16
Clinton's 65% Killer Death Tax; The Democrat heads further toward Bernie Sanders Nirvana.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1822214775?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton says she wants the votes of Republicans who are troubled by Donald Trump, but you wouldn't know it from her continued left turns on the economy. On Thursday she decided that her proposal to raise the death tax to 45% from 40% isn't enough and endorsed even higher levies that would apply to thousands of estates.Though she defeated Bernie Sanders in the primary, she is adopting the socialist's death-tax rate structure. She'd tax all estates over $10 million at 50%, apply a 55% rate on estates over $50 million, and go to 65% on assets above $500 million. The 65% rate would be the highest since 1981 and is another example of how she is repudiating the more moderate policies of her husband and the Democrats of the 1990s.The left claims only the super-wealthy will pay high rates, but the Sanders plan that Mrs. Clinton is copying did not index exemption levels for inflation. One reason a bipartisan movement emerged to reform the death tax in the 1990s was because the then 55% rate engulfed ever more taxpayers over time. Mrs. Clinton would also end the ""step-up in basis"" on stock valuations for many filers, triggering big capital gains taxes for a much broader population.She also knows most of her rich friends will set up foundations, as she and Bill Clinton have, to shelter most of their riches from the estate tax. As Americans have learned, these supposed charities can be terrific vehicles for employing political operatives while they wait for Chelsea to run for the Senate.Mrs. Clinton must realize her plan has no chance of passing as long as Republicans hold the House or Senate, so it's odd she would propose it now. Perhaps she can feel the national surge of non-enthusiasm for her candidacy and wants to mobilize the Bernie brigades with some more fervent class warfare. Or perhaps she's so confident of victory she figures she and Speaker Nancy Pelosi could pull this off, or maybe she's laying out a confiscatory rate as an opening negotiating bid with Republican Speaker Paul Ryan.In any case, Mrs. Clinton is now promising total tax hikes of $1.5 trillion over a decade if elected President. Keep in mind this is part of her fiscal plan to grow the economy.In better tax news, Congress is starting to push back against President Obama's stealth death tax increase. Rep. Warren Davidson (R., Ohio) read our recent editorial about Treasury plans to raise taxes on minority stakes in family businesses by artificially inflating their value, and he's drafted a bill to stop Treasury's tax grab as a violation of the separation of powers.In June Mr. Davidson won a special election to fill the seat of retired House Speaker John Boehner. The new Congressman tells us that since he's ""just on the gig three months,"" he's still working on the legislative strategy to block the Obama tax raid.But it's clear that his understanding of the underlying issue already exceeds that of anyone at the Obama Treasury--or the Clinton campaign. A former owner of several businesses, Mr. Davidson says the U.S. economy needs owners focused on ""growing assets, not structuring them for life events."" He explains that many farms in particular may carry high values but hold little cash, and so the death tax triggers land sales to pay the IRS.""The whole concept of a death tax is immoral,"" Mr. Davidson says, and he's right. The tax confiscates assets that have already been taxed once or more when first earned, and it punishes a lifetime of investment and thrift. The desire to pass along assets to heirs is also a motivation for many entrepreneurs. No one we know labors to turn two-thirds of a life's work over to politicians to spend.Mr. Trump has proposed to eliminate the death tax, and along with his other reforms (see nearby) the differences with Mrs. Clinton on taxes may be more stark than in any presidential race in decades.",9/23/16
Election 2016: Sanders Wins Some Policy Concessions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805664696?accountid=12768,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are finally moving toward a truce after a fierce Democratic presidential primary fight, with the presumptive nominee making a series of policy concessions and campaign hires aimed at winning the Vermont senator's endorsement ahead of the general election.Mrs. Clinton accepted changes Mr. Sanders wanted to the party's platform, including calls for abolishing the death penalty, and rolled out new policy goals in recent days that nudged her to the left in hopes of wooing her primary opponent and his voting coalition.These steps have helped ease the path to a Sanders endorsement, which could come as early as Tuesday at a joint campaign appearance in New Hampshire. In the month since the final Democratic primary, Mr. Sanders has said he would vote for Mrs. Clinton but has stopped short of a formal endorsement.""It's fair to say that the Clinton campaign and our campaign are coming closer and closer together in trying to address the major issues facing our country,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters in a weekend conference call.It is unclear whether Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders would make a potent duo on the campaign trail. The pair showed little warmth during the primary season, with Mr. Sanders at one point questioning whether the former senator and secretary of state was qualified to be president. As Mr. Sanders returned to his Senate duties full-time, still refusing to endorse her, Mrs. Clinton found another liberal icon to join her on the campaign trail: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.Still, Mrs. Clinton wants Mr. Sanders on board, and her campaign has hired some members of his team. One Sanders aide is now an organizing director for college campuses. Field staffers once on the Sanders payroll are now working for Mrs. Clinton.Since the primaries ended on June 14, Clinton campaign officials have been pressing Team Sanders on when he would make an endorsement. They pointed out that in the hard-fought 2008 Democratic race, Mrs. Clinton endorsed then-Sen. Barack Obama four days after the final primary.Mr. Sanders opted for a slower timetable. Advisers said he viewed his endorsement as leverage in getting Mrs. Clinton to accept a more liberal party platform that codified pieces of his campaign message.As time passed, the Clinton campaign explored asking intermediaries to reach out to Mr. Sanders to see if they could persuade him to join forces with Mrs. Clinton, people familiar with the matter say.Some of Mr. Sanders's supporters worried that if he waited too long his influence would wane, but heappears to have reaped some dividends by holding out.The 187-member Democratic Platform Committee spent two days in Orlando last week crafting a proposed document that lays out the party's beliefs and goals. On Saturday, Mr. Sanders notched a victory, with the committee approving language that calls for a $15 hourly federal minimum wage indexed to inflation. That was his position during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton backed a $12 minimum wage, though she said she favored a $15 wage in certain parts of the country.Consistent with Mr. Sanders's position, the new platform seeks the abolishment of the death penalty. Mrs. Clinton has said she favors the death penalty for certain ""heinous"" crimes.Also gratifying to Mr. Sanders was a Clinton announcement Saturday that she favored a priority of his, promising to increase spending on community health centers. Mr. Sanders said her proposal would expand access to health care, ""save lives and ease suffering.""Not everything has gone Mr. Sanders's way. A majority on the platform committee were Clinton loyalists, meaning he needed her cooperation to get the precise wording he wanted.Mr. Sanders had called for platform language opposing a 12-nation trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The trade pact is important to Mr. Obama, and the committee voted for milder language that didn't explicitly reject the TPP.Delegates at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia will vote on the platform later this month.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Carol E.

Notes From the Underground; On Trump's taxes and Sanders's cellar dwellers.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825243165?accountid=12768,"Mitt Romney was wrong. At least one member of the 47% supported his presidential candidacy four years ago, though Romney didn't return the favor.That would be Donald J. Trump. Actually, it's not clear if Trump was among Romney's 47%--those with no federal income-tax liability--in 2012, though the New York Times speculates he ""could have"" been. But according to documents received by the Times, Trump ""declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns"" and therefore paid no income tax that year.Trump has departed from the decades-old custom of tax-return disclosure by presidential candidates, so that the Times received the partial 1995 state income-tax returns in the mail from an anonymous source--purportedly someone inside Trump Tower, though the only evidence for that is the return address.Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Trump, said his client did not authorize the disclosure and threatened ""prompt initiation of appropriate legal action"" over its publication. That's unlikely to be successful, as the Times would claim that the public interest in a candidate's finances is great enough that the paper's First Amendment right to publish outweighs any legal prohibition.Not that there's all that much to see here. The Times concedes that the ""tax experts"" it consulted ""said nothing in the 1995 documents suggested any wrongdoing by Mr. Trump,"" even though the size of the loss was unusual enough that it ""probably attracted extra scrutiny from I.R.S. examiners.""The story's headline reads: ""Donald Trump Tax Records Show He Could Have Avoided Taxes for Nearly Two Decades, The Times Found."" That is, the story rests heavily on speculation about what Trump might have done in subsequent years, which are as yet undocumented.For businesses, the federal income tax is a levy on profits--revenues minus expenses--not revenues. That means you don't pay the tax unless you make a profit. But while the government takes a share of your profit, it does not share your exposure to risk. If you earn $1,000, a substantial portion of it goes to the Treasury. If you lose $1,000, it all comes out of your pocket.Except that if you stay in business after a loss, you can use the loss to offset profits in future years. ""Although Mr. Trump's taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916 million loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years,"" the time limit on such carry-overs, the Times reports.Under that scenario, however--and let us emphasize the Times has no facts to back up this speculation--Trump would still come out behind. A $916 million loss in 1995, followed by $50 million gains in each of the next 18 years comes out to a net loss of $16 million. Again, a business doesn't pay income taxes when it loses money. And the carry-over is not adjusted for inflation, so that the putative $900 million in profit from 1996 through 2013 was worth less than $900 million in 1995 dollars.Mrs. Clinton and the Times hope swing voters don't understand the tax system; for those who do, this doesn't reflect badly on Trump at all (except on his judgment in refusing to release his returns earlier so as to avert the October surprise). It does make Romney look foolish with his 47% analysis back in 2012. As we noted at the time :Romney's description of the 47% as consisting of--our paraphrase here--a bunch of freeloaders is inaccurate. Forbes's Janet Novack reports that in 2011 more than 60% of such households paid federal payroll taxes. That means that somebody in the household was working for at least part of the year, but the household income was either not high enough to be subject to the income tax or offset by the Earned Income Tax Credit and similar subsidies.Of households that paid neither income nor payroll taxes, more than half ""were headed by a senior--in other words, by someone who paid payroll taxes and likely some income taxes too, in the past."" Some additional fraction presumably consisted of the unemployed, of businessmen or investors who showed a loss for the year, and of affluent earners who donated most of the year's income to charity.Speaking of politicians' impolitic political analysis, Hillary Clinton is at it again--or rather she was at it in February, and we're learning about it now, thanks to the Washington Free Beacon , which obtained an audio recording of the private event.The Beacon's Lachlan Markay was more interested in Mrs. Clinton's remarks on defense policy, but Politico extracted the segment in which she described Bernie Sanders's supporters ""as political newbies attempting to deal with an economy that has fallen short of their expectations"":""Some are new to politics completely. They're children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents' basement,"" she said. ""They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don't see much of a future.""Clinton added: ""If you're feeling like you're consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot, and doesn't have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing.""""I think we all should be really understanding of that,"" Clinton said.At least she didn't call then ""irredeemable"" or ""not America."" As political analysis goes, this is more astute than Mrs. Clinton's own basket of deplorables, Romney's 47% or Barack Obama's bitter clingers. It does seem reasonable to think one reason young voters are attracted to Sanders and his promise of ""political revolution"" is that they bought expensive college degrees that turned out to be counterfeit tickets to success.Mrs. Clinton's analysis is incomplete, though understandably so. Another reason young people like Sanders is his manifest sincerity. Even this columnist finds that aspect of Sanders's persona appealing, though we regard most of his ideas as foolish and pernicious. But Mrs. Clinton can't very well acknowledge Sanders's sincerity, because of what that would say about the comparison with Mrs. Clinton. Even generally honest people aren't usually that honest.The remark about Sanders supporters' ""living in their parents' basements"" was tone-deaf and odd, though. It reminded us of a riff from Paul Ryan 's 2012 Republican conventions speech in which, as we recalled, he said much the same thing. When we looked it up, we discovered Ryan had not referred to basements at all. What he said was this:College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life.The last time this columnist lived with our parents--for a few months during the summer when we were 19--we stayed in a bedroom. We suspect that is the common experience, especially in parts of the country, namely the South and Southwest, where basements are uncommon for reasons of geology or weather.Where there are basements, some homeowners will finish them and use them as rec rooms or even bedrooms. More commonly, they're just a place to store useless junk--which is not a nice way to characterize the young voters who support your opponent.Sanders himself has mixed feelings about Mrs. Clinton's remark. ""What she was saying there is absolutely correct,"" he told ABC's ""This Week"" yesterday, quoted by the Puffington Host . ""And that is, you've got millions of young people, many of whom took out loans in order to go to college, hoping to go out and get decent-paying, good jobs.""But on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" as the Washington Examiner notes, Sanders was asked if the comment bothered him. ""Well, look, of course it does,"" he said:""But we were in the middle of a campaign and . . . in some of the statements that I made about Hillary Clinton, you can see real differences,"" he quickly added. ""So we have differences. There's nothing to be surprised about. That's what a campaign is all about.""Poor Sanders is in the same unpleasant position as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio--supporting the candidate who vanquished him in the primaries as the lesser of evils in the general election, and genuinely believing the ""evils"" part. We'll find out after Election Day if the cellar dwellers are persuaded by Mrs. Clinton's status as the lesser.Metaphor Alert ""Brutal Headwinds Crush Europe's Centre-Left Heavyweights""--headline, Yahoo!

Election at Bernie's; The Harrisonburg 19 may need some help getting to the polls.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825675982?accountid=12768,"It's election season, which means Democrats are again pushing the line that voter fraud is a myth. Allow us to introduce them to the 19 dead registered voters in Harrisonburg, Virginia.Harrisonburg Registrar Debbie Logan late last week acknowledged that her office had fielded 19 fraudulent applications, submitted under the names of dead Virginians. The fraud came to light because a long-time clerk saw an application under the name of Richard Claybrook Sr., the deceased father of a well-known local judge. The elder Claybrook died in 2014.According to news reports, investigators have obtained a confession from Andrew Spieles, a James Madison University student working for a voter registration shop called HarrisonburgVOTES. The outfit purports to be nonpartisan, but it is run by Joe Fitzgerald, the chairman of his congressional district's Democratic Committee, and Mr. Spieles is a member of Virginia Young Democrats.Mr. Fitzgerald told reporters that he fired Mr. Spieles after he confessed, and no charges have been filed, though officials say the investigation continues. Meanwhile, the Colorado Secretary of State is investigating another case of Election at Bernie's, after a local CBS affiliate uncovered multiple instances of dead Coloradans who cast ballots in recent elections.Democrats are already saying the dead Harrisonburg 19 are no big deal, with Virginia House Minority Leader David Toscano claiming there was no voter fraud because ""they caught him"" before the votes were cast. Which is like saying it wasn't a robbery because the thief was caught carrying the TV out of the house.Democrats push the fraud-is-a-myth theme because it furthers their political goal of portraying any ballot-security measure as racist in order to drive minority turnout. But the integrity of the ballot matters as much as access to the ballot, and every fraudulent vote cancels a legitimate one. With trust in democratic institutions already frayed, the country doesn't need elections that are tainted by voter fraud, which is no myth.",10/5/16
Election 2016: Sanders Endorses Clinton --- Vermont senator acts after his rival moves to the left on several of his key policy issues,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803344234?accountid=12768,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders offered an unequivocal endorsement of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, ending an intense intraparty rivalry amid signs that progressive holdouts are coalescing around the presumptive Democratic nominee for the fall showdown with Republican Donald Trump.After a protracted duel that divided the Democratic Party between Mrs. Clinton's pragmatic policy proposals and the Vermont senator's more ambitious, left-leaning vision, Mr. Sanders cleared the way for a unified front in the general-election campaign.""I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing Hillary Clinton and why she must become our next president,"" Mr. Sanders told a crowd that blended supporters of both candidates.On Tuesday, the Democratic candidates returned to New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders notched his first victory in the primary campaign. He contrasted Mrs. Clinton with Mr. Trump, saying that the presumptive GOP nominee would lower or even abolish the minimum wage, give tax breaks to the rich and appoint Supreme Court justices who would trample on civil liberties.Mr. Trump has courted Sanders voters in recent weeks, pointing out similarities he sees between them on issues such as trade and the purported rigged nature of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, he took to Twitter to castigate Mr. Sanders. ""I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. ""They are not happy that he is selling out!""In trying to win Mr. Sanders's backing, Mrs. Clinton in recent weeks rolled out new policies that he had embraced on the campaign trail.She moved closer to a Sanders plan that would eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities. Mrs. Clinton called for free tuition at public schools for families earning up to $85,000 a year, with the cap rising to $125,000 in five years. Over the weekend, she released a plan to increase spending for community health centers -- a Sanders priority.Mr. Sanders's show of support came after weeks of negotiations between the two camps. But by the time he endorsed her -- more than a month after his rival essentially clinched the nomination -- many of his supporters already had gotten behind Mrs. Clinton.Polls show a majority of Sanders backers now support the former secretary of state. And this week, three progressive groups endorsed Mrs. Clinton, signaling they would work to elect her and urging their supporters to do the same.The question now for Mrs. Clinton is whether the rest of the rank-and-file voters who backed Mr. Sanders fall in line.On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders highlighted areas of agreement with Mrs. Clinton, ticking through a list of issues where they have found common ground, while also acknowledging sharp differences in their policy agendas.---Byron Tau, Kirstina Peterson and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",10/5/16

The home's entry has 30-foot-high ceilings and a double staircase. There is a two-lane bowling alley, a wine cellar and tasting room, catering kitchen, gym and a beauty salon with massage and tanning rooms. The roughly 7,000-square-foot master suite has its own kitchen, living room and a two-level closet connected by a pair of staircases.Outside there is a swimming pool, tennis court, formal gardens and a circular motor court with a fountain and space to park 100 cars, Mr. Hilton said.Mr. Spelling and his wife, Candy, built the French chateau-style home around 1990. After her husband's death, Ms. Spelling listed the house for $150 million, and it was on the market for about two years before it was purchased in 2011 for $85 million by Ms. Stunt, the daughter of the British billionaire and Formula One racing boss Bernie Ecclestone. Ms. Stunt embarked on an extensive renovation, employing about 500 workers . ""She didn't spare any expense in the renovation,"" Mr. Hilton said, although he declined to specify how much the project cost.Mr. Hilton said Ms. Stunt and her husband, entrepreneur James Stunt, are selling because their children are in school in London and they aren't spending much time in Los Angeles. She bought a home in London's Chelsea neighborhood in 2010 for about $90 million. The Stunts couldn't be reached for comment.After a spate of big-ticket sales in the past few months, Los Angeles has seen a number of high-end properties go on the market. A Beverly Hills estate once owned by William Randolph Hearst listed in September for $195 million--up 18% from its last formal listing price of $165 million in 2007 .Mr. Hilton said the Stunt home's value comes from the fact that it is ""in the best location and in move-in condition.""

Bernie Sanders Packs Schedule With Campaign Stops for Hillary Clinton; A smaller core of young voters who flocked to senator's primary run consider third-party candidates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1826901354?accountid=12768,"DEARBORN, Mich.--Hollice McCollie set up his T-shirt stand outside the union hall where former primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, was making his case for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.He put out seven stacks of Sanders shirts, and at the end of his folding table, a single pile touting Mrs. Clinton.Mr. McCollice, who travels the country selling T-shirts and buttons, said he included the Clinton shirts in a bow to political reality. ""I'm for Bernie, but I'm an entrepreneur,"" he said. ""I have to sell Hillary.""Many of the Vermont senator's supporters share his ambivalence. Four months after Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton came together following a contentious primary, and a month before Election Day, most of his backers are falling in line behind Mrs. Clinton--some with enthusiasm, some reluctantly.A smaller core, particularly young voters who flocked to his primary run, are considering or planning to vote for third-party candidates instead.Mr. Sanders is working to bring them aboard with a newly packed schedule of campaign stops. On Wednesday, he was in Iowa; on Thursday, he made four stops in Michigan; and on Friday he traveled to Maine. On Saturday, he headlines a pair of events in Pennsylvania, with more stops to come.In his speeches, Mr. Sanders is more passionate about his disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump than he is enthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton. He offers no anecdotes about the former secretary of state, or testimonials to her experience or leadership.""This campaign is not a personality contest,"" he told several hundred people at the United Auto Workers hall here. ""I understand that neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump are particularly popular . I get that. But forget about that for a moment. Take a hard look at the agendas of the campaign, what these candidates stand for.""Mr. Sanders then ran through the high points of the stump speech he delivered hundreds of times during his primary campaign, repeatedly interjecting that Mrs. Clinton understands, as he does, the need to increase the minimum wage, rebuild infrastructure, tackle climate change, make college more affordable and change campaign finance law.Mrs. Clinton has a lot of work to do in Dearborn, home to many of the working-class white voters who have been drawn to Mr. Trump's campaign , said Nick Kottalis, president of the UAW's Dearborn Truck Plant unit.Mr. Trump ""has a solid foundation in the plant,"" Mr. Kottalis said. ""There's just a lot of men who just don't want a woman at the top. They think she's pro-establishment, and they want change.""At the UAW hall, Mr. Sanders tried to appeal to those voters the issue of trade. Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested Mr. Sanders backers should support him because they both oppose free trade agreements.Mr. Sanders replied with thunderous outrage that so many Trump-branded products are manufactured abroad. ""Don't tell me about your love of the American worker when you're exploiting poor people in Bangladesh. Bring those plants back to America!"" he said.The crowd was filled with Sanders-turned-Clinton supporters.Fadia Faraj, 51 years old, says she cried when Mr. Sanders lost the primary contest and was determined to vote for Green Party nominee Jill Stein. She says Mr. Sanders persuaded her to back Mrs. Clinton.""I have to listen to Bernie,"" said Ms. Faraj, of Dearborn Heights. ""He keeps saying, `Hold her accountable.' He keeps saying, 'Trust me.'"" She added if Mrs. Clinton ""does something crazy,"" or if proof emerges she rigged the primary election against Mr. Sanders, she will vote for Ms. Stein.""If Bernie didn't push so hard for us to vote for Hillary Clinton, I wouldn't vote,"" said Benjamin Roy, 44, who works for an auto parts supplier and plans to vote for her at his urging. But he said, repeatedly, ""I don't like Hillary Clinton.""In Dearborn, Jason Kuczek, age 39, said he wouldn't support Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton and might write in Mr. Sanders's name or vote for Ms. Stein. Even if his pick loses, he said, ""At least I voted for the person I felt would be the best president of the United States.""But David Russell, age 61, a retired factory worker, said he never doubted he would vote for Mrs. Clinton once she won the primary.""It's obvious you can't vote for Trump,"" Mr. Russell said. He said he sees many Trump yard signs in his neighborhood, so he put a Clinton sign in his yard and plans to make phone calls for her.""I don't see the country doing a lot of change under Hillary,"" he said. On the upside, ""It's not going to get worse.""Later in the day, Mr. Sanders appeared before an overflow crowd at the University of Michigan. Polling shows Mrs. Clinton running well behind President Barack Obama's support with young voters, and Mr. Sanders's campaign itinerary includes some college campuses.Outside the museum where he appeared, Deb Ennis, an art teacher from nearby Ypsilanti, held a large sign proclaiming, ""We still want Bernie.""She said she plans to vote for Ms. Stein. ""I never identified with a party in the first place. So it's not like I'm leaving"" the Democrats.Still, Mr. McCollie, the T-shirt salesman, had followed Mr. Sanders to Ann Arbor, and as he packed up, he reported that on campus, he sold quite a few Clinton shirts.As for his own vote, he is undecided.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comMore Election 2016* Town-Hall Format Will Test Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton (Oct. 7)* Sunday's Clinton-Trump Debate: What Political Strategists Are Watching for (Oct. 7)* President Obama Casts His Vote Early in Chicago (Oct. 7)* Donald Trump's Debate Challenge: Shift Clinton Opponents Into Pro-Trump Camp (Oct. 7)* Joe Biden Tells Ambivalent Pennsylvania Democrats: 'Remember Al Gore' (Oct. 7)Credit: By Laura Meckler",10/8/16
Bernie Sanders Gives Hillary Clinton a Pass Over Speech Excerpts; Former Democratic presidential hopeful had once pressed eventual nominee to release transcripts of her Wall Street remarks,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1826947975?accountid=12768,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, who during the Democratic primaries had demanded Hillary Clinton release transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street firms, expressed no such concern after the publication of what appeared to be hacked excerpts from those speeches .The excerpts offer evidence for many of the charges he leveled during their contentious contest, but Mr. Sanders is supporting Mrs. Clinton's campaign and on Saturday passed up the chance to criticize her.The organization that publishes secret information, WikiLeaks, on Friday released what it said was email correspondence of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, including what appeared to be excerpts from the Democratic presidential candidate's Wall Street speeches in recent years, which she had refused to release. The Clinton campaign declined to verify their authenticity.All the speeches were from before Mrs. Clinton launched her current presidential campaign.In the excerpts, Mrs. Clinton appears to be talking in private in a tone more favorable to free trade and to banks than she took on the campaign trail. For instance, the excerpts show that in a 2013 speech, she says, ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.""She also apparently praises Wall Street bankers and a budget proposal that included cuts to Social Security benefits. Mr. Sanders campaigned hard against Mrs. Clinton, saying she had supported damaging free trade agreements and was too close to Wall Street. He also questioned her commitment to protecting Social Security.After he lost the nomination, though, Mrs. Clinton made some policy concessions to him and he endorsed her candidacy.On Saturday, he focused on their shared policy agenda. ""Whatever Secretary Clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on Wall Street, I am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic Party platform which was agreed to by her campaign,"" he said. He cited the platform's call to break up large financial institutions and prosecuting Wall Street executives who ""engaged in illegal behavior.""Mr. Sanders also said he would continue fighting the pending Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement Mrs. Clinton praised as it was being developed when she was secretary of state, but ultimately came out against. She has said she won't change her mind about the trade pact if she is elected, amid concern from some trade opponents that she would reverse course again.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler",10/10/16

Hacked Emails Show Clinton Links With Democratic Party; Disclosures raise questions about whether Bernie Sanders supporters may turn against the party's presidential nominee,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828028400?accountid=12768,"Newly disclosed emails show there were close ties between Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and top Democratic Party officials long before she wrapped up the nomination, despite a longstanding mandate that the national party remain neutral in intraparty fights.More emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta were published Wednesday by the website WikiLeaks, shedding new light on the relationship between top party officials and Mrs. Clinton's campaign--a source of acrimony among Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic National Committee during the primary campaign season.The emails have the potential to revive the anger some Sanders supporters felt toward the party and its leaders. Mrs. Clinton has had trouble consolidating some of the demographic groups that backed Mr. Sanders, especially younger voters--though Mr. Sanders himself has become an enthusiastic surrogate for Mrs. Clinton.On Wednesday, Mr. Podesta's Twitter account also was hacked, with a message posted declaring, ""I've switched teams. Vote Trump 2016.""The emails released so far contain mostly embarrassing but not politically explosive banter among Mrs. Clinton's top aides about politics, personnel and campaign strategy. But Republican nominee Donald Trump has made the leak a prominent theme on the campaign trail, alleging the emails demonstrate ""corruption.""""The Hillary Clinton documents released today by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election, so much corruption. This election will determine whether we remain a free country in the truest sense of the word or we become a corrupt banana republic,"" Mr. Trump said at a Tuesday rally.Donna Brazile, who was a CNN contributor and then the vice chairwoman of the DNC, wrote in one email to Mr. Podesta that ""as soon as the nomination is wrapped up, I will be your biggest surrogate."" In another chain, she appears to have been in possession of a question that would be asked of Mrs. Clinton one day later at a town-hall meeting, sharing it with Clinton campaign officials.A day before a CNN Democratic presidential town hall event, Ms. Brazile sent Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri an email with the heading: ""From time to time I get the questions in advance.""Ms. Brazile included a question about the death penalty in the email, saying, ""here's one that worries me about HRC."" The following day, Ricky Jackson, a former death-row inmate who was exonerated, asked Mrs. Clinton about the issue during the televised town-hall event.""I often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign, and any suggestions that indicate otherwise are simply untrue,"" Ms. Brazile, who is now the party's interim chairwoman, said in a statement. ""As it pertains to the CNN Debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.""Added a CNN spokesperson: ""As we have said since news of this broke, CNN did not share a question with Donna Brazile, or anyone else for that matter, prior to the town hall,"" adding that the network believed a broadcast partner on the town hall may have shared the question.In another thread, an adviser to Mrs. Clinton drafted a memo concerning the debate schedule, suggesting limiting the number of debates and limiting Mrs. Clinton's one-on-one debates. The DNC initially scheduled six debates, drawing protests from Mr. Sanders and Martin O'Malley, another Democratic candidate, that more were needed.Mr. Podesta and Mrs. Clinton's campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, also received an email from a scholar at the Center for American Progress noting that then-Wall Street Journal managing editor Robert Thomson and Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, which owns the Journal, were raising their children as Catholics.""Many of the most powerful elements of the conservative movement are all Catholic (many converts) from the SC and think tanks to the media and social groups,"" wrote John Halpin, a senior fellow at the Center.Ms. Palmieri wrote back: ""I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion. Their rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelicals.""Mrs. Clinton's campaign has refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of the hacked documents, which WikiLeaks claims amount to about 50,000 emails belonging to Mr. Podesta, one of Mrs. Clinton's top advisers and political strategists. So far, the organization has published about 7,200 documents, and campaign officials are bracing for the release of a few thousand documents a day until Election Day.The Federal Bureau of Investigation suspects Russian intelligence agencies are behind the disclosures of the Clinton campaign emails and of a contractor handling Florida voter data, according to people briefed on the investigations.Top Russian officials shifted on Wednesday from denying a role in a separate hack of the DNC. ""Everyone is saying, 'Who did it?' "" President Vladimir Putin said at an investor forum in Moscow. ""But does it matter that much? It's what's inside the information that matters.""""If you think you'd like all the contents of all your emails for 10 years dumped into public, think about how that feels. It doesn't feel great,"" Mr. Podesta told reporters Tuesday. ""But I'm kind of Zen about it at this stage."" The Clinton campaign has suggested that Russia may have orchestrated the hack. The FBI suspects Russian intelligence agencies are behind the hack, according to people briefed on the investigations.Mr. Sanders made the removal of DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz a priority during the primaries. Ms. Wasserman Schultz stepped down over the summer, after a separate email leak showed DNC staffers disparaging Mr. Sanders.""The job of the progressive movement now is to look forward, not backward,"" Sen. Sanders said in a statement. ""No matter what Secretary Clinton may have said years ago behind closed doors, what's important today is that millions of people stand up and demand that the Democratic Party implement the most progressive platform in the history of our country.""In an email thread from 2014, Mr. Podesta and Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, discussed the potential Democratic primary election calendar, which at that point was still in flux amid negotiations among state parties, state governments and the DNC.Democratic consultant Chris Lehane ""called me about [California] primary and I told him that the operating strategy is to keep blue states late (i.e. don't move CA),"" Mr. Mook wrote. ""He said he was at dinner with you and was under the impression that you wanted to move it earlier. He's wondering how to proceed and I said I'd try to get us on the same page and go back with an answer. Are you OK with me saying that we both want CA to stay where it is?""In another email, an adviser named Charlie Baker sent a ""debate proposal"" outlining that the Clinton campaign had concluded that it was in its interest to limit the number of debates, start them later in the calendar and avoid any February events.""The other campaigns have advocated (not surprisingly) for more debates and for the schedule to start significantly earlier. Mo and Anita believe that this announcement prior to the actual entry into the race of other candidates will strengthen their hand as they lock a schedule in with local media partners and state parties,"" Mr. Baker wrote, referring to a DNC staff member and a consultant.The initial plan that the Democratic Party eventually adopted many of Mrs. Clinton's campaign recommendations, scheduling six debates which started in October, 2015--months after the Republicans held their first debate. Under pressure from Mr. Sanders, the party eventually added several forums. A Democratic Party official said Wednesday that the party had been in contact with all its presidential candidates and it's unclear what transpired in the internal debate or why the party made the decisions it made.In other emails, the independence of the DNC was questioned. In a March, 2015 email exchange, a top Clinton adviser expressed frustration that Ms. Wasserman Schultz was moving ahead with plans to hire a chief for the Democratic National Convention without the Clinton team's stamp of approval.""I'm distressed that DWS hired a convention CEO without consulting us,"" Mr. Mook wrote. ""John--you, Charlie and I may need to sit down with Debbie to make clear how we want things to change/improve before we are willing to consider playing ball with them."" The email was sent before Mrs. Clinton even had officially launched her campaign.Mr. Mook wrote in a subsequent message to Mrs. Clinton: ""It boggles my mind that they didn't even consult the White House or us.""Devlin Barrett, Damian Paletta, Carol E.

"Bernie Sanders's Memoir to Hit Bookshelves Nov. 15; Publisher to print 300,000 copies in a strong showing of faith the Vermont senator's admirers still 'Feel the Bern'",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1829443466?accountid=12768,"A week after Election Day, there will be a second popular vote. Bernie Sanders's admirers will have an opportunity to show whether their affection for the senator from Vermont was a flirtation or something more serious.On Nov. 15, Sen. Sanders's memoir, ""Our Revolution,"" will hit bookstores. Thomas Dunne Books, an imprint of St. Martin's Press, is printing 300,000 hardcover copies in a strong showing of faith. The hardcover edition is priced at $27, which Sen. Sanders has said was the size of his average campaign contribution.""The campaign itself is a significant part of the book,"" says Thomas Dunne, a veteran publisher. ""I'm hoping everybody who voted for him or donated money to the campaign will have to have the book.""Sen. Sanders's work is one of two major titles debuting Nov. 15th. HarperCollins Publishers is publishing 2 million hardcover copies of Fox News star Megyn Kelly's memoir, ""Settle for More,"" on the same day.Both books are embargoed, meaning their publishers aren't releasing early copies. HarperCollins, like The Wall Street Journal, is owned by News Corp.Whether readers will embrace a new political memoir published so closely after the coming election is unclear. ""There's never a guarantee,"" says Vivien Jennings, owner of the independent store Rainy Day Books based in Fairway, Kan. ""Once the election is over, people might say, 'I'm so done with this!'""Sen. Sanders attracted 13 million votes, or 43% of the total nationwide Democratic popular vote, according to TheGreenPapers.com, an independent website that focuses on federal and statewide elections.""There will certainly be more than a few 'politics geeks' who will likely want to read about the man at the center of the 'Sanders phenomenon' in 2016 Democratic Party politics in his own words,"" said Richard E. Berg-Andersson, the website's lead commentator.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, tested the publishing waters in early September with their policy book, ""Stronger Together: A Blueprint for America's Future."" The title has sold a modest 10,000 copies in paperback, according to book-sales tracker Nielsen BookScan.""There is a long tradition of publishing campaign books, and as Hillary's longtime publisher we felt it was important that we make her and Tim Kaine's policy positions available to readers,"" said Cary Goldstein, a spokesman for the Simon & Schuster imprint of CBS Corp.'s Simon & Schuster publishing arm. The publishing house didn't pay an advance, he added.Mrs. Clinton's presidential rival, Republican candidate Donald Trump, has also reached out to voters with a book. Last November, Simon & Schuster's Threshold Editions published Mr. Trump's blueprint for reshaping the U.S., ""Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again."" This past July, the book was published as a fancy paperback with a new cover and new title: ""Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America.""""It was a best-seller in the U.S.,"" says Louise Burke, publisher of Threshold Editions. ""What surprised me is that foreign rights sales for the hardcover edition were also strong."" The hardcover and paperback editions together have sold 267,000 copies, according to Nielsen BookScan.Ronald Goldfarb, a Washington lawyer and literary agent, first approached Sen. Sanders about writing a book in the spring of 2015. Mr. Goldfarb later circled back after the Senator's quest to become the Democratic nominee for president had ended.""He wrote it himself,"" added Mr. Goldfarb, who sold the book without going to auction. ""He didn't want a ghost writer."" Terms weren't disclosed. A spokesman for the senator said he was unavailable for comment.Sen. Sanders will promote his book on tour, including a stop at the Miami Book Fair on Nov. 19. Lissette Mendez, the fair's director of programming, says she expects his appearance will fill 1,000 seats at Miami Dade College's Chapman Conference Center in downtown Miami and that the fair plans to live-stream the event to nearby locations on campus.Earlier in his career Sen. Sanders collaborated on a book that chronicled his years in Vermont, including his election to the House of Representatives as an independent. ""Outsider in the House,"" written with Huck Gutman, an English professor at the University of Vermont, was updated last year by Verso Books and given a new title, ""Outsider in the White House.""The work has sold a respectable 27,000 copies in paperback and as an e-book, according to Andrew Hsiao, Verso's U.S. publisher. ""It was nice to see a new life for an old book,"" he said.Write to Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg at jeffrey.trachtenberg@wsj.comCredit: By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg",10/17/16
Trump's 'Rigged' Election -- and Bernie's,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1829666653?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump recently declared himself ""unshackled,"" and now we know what he meant: The businessman is in full Steve Bannon-Breitbart mode, invoking an international conspiracy to steal the election and maybe fluoridate the water. As demagogic as this rhetoric is, his critics sure are selective in their outrage.""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,"" Mr. Trump posted on Twitter Sunday night. He followed up Monday morning that ""of course"" there is ""large scale voter fraud,"" and the plot against him is now a regular line at his rallies. This is Mr. Trump's response to the oppo-research hits about his personal misconduct and sexual ethics, though he tends to conflate his two ""rigging"" claims about electoral fraud and media bias.No presidential candidate should portray U.S. elections as illegitimate, and Mike Pence was right to say Sunday that the GOP will ""absolutely"" abide by November's results. Hillary Clinton is not going to steal the White House like Lyndon Johnson stole a Texas Senate seat in 1948. Voting irregularities are real, and cheating sometimes happens, especially in machine cities, but voters should have confidence in the electoral system. There's zero evidence that the process is compromised across multiple states and precincts.But the liberal freak-out over Mr. Trump's allegedly ""unprecedented"" and ""dangerous"" remarks could use some perspective. Where would Mr. Trump possibly get the idea that the system is rigged?Well, maybe he listened to Bernie Sanders, who in January described his ""message, which says that the economy today is rigged, that it benefits the wealthy and the powerful at the expense of everybody else, that the campaign finance system that exists today is corrupt and undermining American democracy."" Or maybe Mr. Trump caught Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic convention saying ""the system is rigged"" or ""the rigged system"" five times in one speech.President Obama and Eric Holder also regularly push the canard that voter-identification laws are attempts at racially motivated disenfranchisement. As recently as 2014, Democrats attempting to keep the Senate tried to motivate minority turnout with ads that explicitly played on black fears of intimidation.African-American registration and voting increased, and at a faster rate than white participation, after allegedly racist North Carolina and Georgia recently passed voter ID laws, but that's not the point. Democrats can't sauce this goose and then complain when Mr. Trump adopts their tactics for his purposes.As it happens, David Remnick reported in the New Yorker last year that John Kerry is convinced that the George W. Bush campaign manipulated the voting machines in 2004 to carry Ohio. The Secretary of State even used this ""very personal experience"" to reassure Afghans that free and fair elections are hard, even in advanced countries. We can't recall the media assault on the top U.S. diplomat for subverting U.S. democracy with such baseless speculation, and where Mr. Trump does have a point is when he says the press corps is nearly unanimous against him.This is usually the case with Republicans, though the difference this year is that journalists say openly that Mr. Trump is a unique threat to democracy. The First Amendment stalwarts would have more credibility if they hadn't portrayed Mitt Romney as a plundering executive with retrograde family values, or tried to take down John McCain in 2008 with innuendo about philandering. GOP voters understand that it doesn't matter how admirable their nominee is, the press will still trash him.---The question for the media this year is that if Mr. Trump poses a threat to the American way, where were they during the GOP primaries? Back then, progresssive partisans who now say Mr. Trump will end civilization turned out columns like ""Why Liberals Should Support a Trump Republican Nomination"" or ""Why I'm more worried about Marco Rubio than Donald Trump.""Many in the media cheered on Mr. Trump when it appeared that he might oppose the GOP's traditional free-market agenda. NBC's ""Access Hollywood"" tape with Mr. Trump and Billy Bush is 11 years old, and weren't Howard Stern's greatest hits as relevant last autumn as they are said to be now? It's not a conspiracy theory to think that the stories coming out in late October are no accident.Disqualifying Mr. Trump with a dump of sleazy passes at women was sure to enrage his supporters who know the history of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump always overreacts and thus he's on a path to lose -- and if he keeps raving about ""the illusion of democracy,"" as he did last week in West Palm Beach, he'll deserve to.

Bernie Sanders's admirers will have an opportunity to show whether their affection for the senator from Vermont was a flirtation or something more serious.On Nov. 15, Sen. Sanders's memoir, ""Our Revolution,"" will hit the bookstores. Thomas Dunne Books, an imprint of St. Martin's Press, is printing 300,000 hardcover copies in a strong showing of faith. The edition is priced at $27, which Sen. Sanders has said was the size of his average campaign contribution.""The campaign itself is a significant part of the book,"" says Thomas Dunne, a veteran publisher. ""I'm hoping everybody who voted for him or donated money to the campaign will have to have the book.""Sen. Sanders's work is one of two major titles debuting Nov. 15. HarperCollins Publishers is publishing 2 million hardcover copies of Fox News star Megyn Kelly's memoir, ""Settle for More,"" on the same day.Both books are embargoed, meaning their publishers aren't releasing early copies. HarperCollins, like The Wall Street Journal, is owned by News Corp.Whether readers will embrace a new political memoir published so closely after the coming election is unclear. ""There's never a guarantee,"" says Vivien Jennings, owner of the independent store Rainy Day Books based in Fairway, Kan. ""Once the election is over, people might say, 'I'm so done with this!'""Sen. Sanders attracted 13 million votes, or 43% of the total nationwide Democratic popular vote, according to TheGreenPapers.com, an independent website that focuses on federal and statewide elections.Ronald Goldfarb, a Washington lawyer and literary agent, first approached Sen. Sanders about writing a book in the spring of 2015. Mr. Goldfarb later circled back after the Senator's quest to become the Democratic nominee for president had ended.""He wrote it himself,"" added Mr. Goldfarb. Terms weren't disclosed. A spokesman for the senator said he was unavailable for comment.Credit: By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg",10/18/16
"Trump's 'Rigged' Election--and Bernie's; Donald is wrong, but where do you think he got the idea?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1829614907?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump recently declared himself ""unshackled,"" and now we know what he meant: The businessman is in full Steve Bannon-Breitbart mode, invoking an international conspiracy to steal the election and maybe fluoridate the water. As demagogic as this rhetoric is, his critics sure are selective in their outrage.""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,"" Mr. Trump posted on Twitter Sunday night. He followed up Monday morning that ""of course"" there is ""large scale voter fraud,"" and the plot against him is now a regular line at his rallies. This is Mr. Trump's response to the oppo-research hits about his personal misconduct and sexual ethics, though he tends to conflate his two ""rigging"" claims about electoral fraud and media bias.No presidential candidate should portray U.S. elections as illegitimate, and Mike Pence was right to say Sunday that the GOP will ""absolutely"" abide by November's results. Hillary Clinton is not going to steal the White House like Lyndon Johnson stole a Texas Senate seat in 1948. Voting irregularities are real, and cheating sometimes happens, especially in machine cities, but voters should have confidence in the electoral system. There's zero evidence that the process is compromised across multiple states and precincts.But the liberal freak-out over Mr. Trump's allegedly ""unprecedented"" and ""dangerous"" remarks could use some perspective. Where would Mr. Trump possibly get the idea that the system is rigged?Well, maybe he listened to Bernie Sanders, who in January described his ""message, which says that the economy today is rigged, that it benefits the wealthy and the powerful at the expense of everybody else, that the campaign finance system that exists today is corrupt and undermining American democracy."" Or maybe Mr. Trump caught Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic convention saying ""the system is rigged"" or ""the rigged system"" five times in one speech.President Obama and Eric Holder also regularly push the canard that voter-identification laws are attempts at racially motivated disenfranchisement. As recently as 2014, Democrats attempting to keep the Senate tried to motivate minority turnout with ads that explicitly played on black fears of intimidation.African-American registration and voting increased, and at a faster rate than white participation, after allegedly racist North Carolina and Georgia recently passed voter ID laws, but that's not the point. Democrats can't sauce this goose and then complain when Mr. Trump adopts their tactics for his purposes.As it happens, David Remnick reported in the New Yorker last year that John Kerry is convinced that the George W. Bush campaign manipulated the voting machines in 2004 to carry Ohio. The Secretary of State even used this ""very personal experience"" to reassure Afghans that free and fair elections are hard, even in advanced countries. We can't recall the media assault on the top U.S. diplomat for subverting U.S. democracy with such baseless speculation, and where Mr. Trump does have a point is when he says the press corps is nearly unanimous against him.This is usually the case with Republicans, though the difference this year is that journalists say openly that Mr. Trump is a unique threat to democracy. The First Amendment stalwarts would have more credibility if they hadn't portrayed Mitt Romney as a plundering executive with retrograde family values, or tried to take down John McCain in 2008 with innuendo about philandering. GOP voters understand that it doesn't matter how admirable their nominee is, the press will still trash him.***The question for the media this year is that if Mr. Trump poses a threat to the American way, where were they during the GOP primaries? Back then, progresssive partisans who now say Mr. Trump will end civilization turned out columns like ""Why Liberals Should Support a Trump Republican Nomination"" or ""Why I'm more worried about Marco Rubio than Donald Trump.""Many in the media cheered on Mr. Trump when it appeared that he might oppose the GOP's traditional free-market agenda. NBC's ""Access Hollywood"" tape with Mr. Trump and Billy Bush is 11 years old, and weren't Howard Stern's greatest hits as relevant last autumn as they are said to be now? It's not a conspiracy theory to think that the stories coming out in late October are no accident.Disqualifying Mr. Trump with a dump of sleazy passes at women was sure to enrage his supporters who know the history of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump always overreacts and thus he's on a path to lose--and if he keeps raving about ""the illusion of democracy,"" as he did last week in West Palm Beach, he'll deserve to. But in winning ugly, Mrs. Clinton and the left will pay a steep price in even more polarized and divisive politics.",10/19/16
The Democratic Convention: Progressive Wing to Take Center Stage --- Sanders to stress Democratic unity on Monday and push for measures he backed,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806401848?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Hillary Clinton's campaign plans to open her nominating convention Monday with a full-throated overture to the Democratic Party's progressive wing, hoping to mend rifts and put to rest grievances that have jeopardized party unity.Two of the speakers on the convention's opening night are senators whose fiery denunciations of corporate power and wealth have made them darlings of the left: Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton's rival in the presidential primaries, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.Another is Astrid Silva, the daughter of undocumented Mexican immigrants who has become a leading advocate for a path to citizenship for people living in the U.S. illegally. An overhaul of the nation's immigration laws is a galvanizing issue for the party's Hispanic constituents, some of whom were disappointed Mrs. Clinton didn't choose a Hispanic as a running mate.A message Mr. Sanders intends to offer is that Democrats need to coalesce behind the larger goal of defeating the Republican presidential nominee, an aide to the senator said Sunday.""It will be a speech that stresses unity and the need to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump,"" Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, said in an interview. ""At the same time,"" he added, Mr. Sanders plans to urge Democrats to ""continue to push for the progressive future that his campaign was based on.""Coming into the convention, the party's liberal core has been restive, unhappy about Mrs. Clinton's selection of Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate and outraged by leaked Democratic National Committee emails that show party operatives maneuvering against Mr. Sanders's campaign.With the email controversy mushrooming, the committee's chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said Sunday she was stepping down, a move that could help mollify Mr. Sanders's supporters who have long feared he was undercut by the Democratic leadership.Jonathan Tasini, a Sanders surrogate and Democratic delegate at the convention, said that Ms. Wasserman Schultz's departure ""removes a flashpoint.""A potential pitfall for Mrs. Clinton is that by seeming to appease the liberal base in such a prominent way on the opening night of the convention, she could alienate more moderate and independent voters who are important to winning in November. The effort could undermine Mrs. Clinton's plans to position herself in the center, where most voters reside.In choosing Mr. Kaine as her running mate, Mrs. Clinton sent a strong signal that she plans to govern from the center, not the left. Indeed, in a recent interview on CBS she described the party she leads as ""center-left,""putting particular emphasis on the word ""center.""RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, one of Mr. Sanders's strongest allies, said of the selection of Mr. Kaine: ""It's outrageous. It was a snub to the Bernie base.""Neil Sroka, communications director of the liberal group Democracy for America, said both the DNC emails and Mr. Kaine's selection were disheartening for progressive voters. He said the Clinton campaign needs to do more to reassure the party's liberal base that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine would stand united in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation free trade deal.But he also predicted that at the end of the week, Democrats would rally behind the need to defeat Mr. Trump.""These two incidents are certainly going to leave a harsh taste in the mouth,"" Mr. Sroka said. ""But there is a deep commitment that goes beyond any one person to making sure that Donald Trump doesn't represent our country on the national or world stage.""As for Mr. Sanders, he told NBC that hewould have preferred to see Mrs. Clinton choose a more progressive running mate, suggesting Ms. Warren would have been a good choice.But he offered muted praise for Mr. Kaine. ""Tim is a very, very smart guy. He's a very nice guy,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""His political views are not my political views. He is more conservative than I am.""Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Colleen McCain Nelson",10/20/16
"Clinton Won the Battle, Sanders the War",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806391710?accountid=12768,"Bill Clinton took Democrats to the political middle. He met with Republicans to pass welfare-to-work laws and put more police on the streets. Barack Obama steered the party leftward with ""change we can believe in."" He promised to end long-running wars, deliver an economic recovery, offer medical coverage to the uninsured and unify an increasingly diverse nation.Hillary Clinton will claim the Democratic nomination this week in Philadelphia, but the party is no longer defined by its standard-bearer. The energy rests instead with a rising generation of Democrats excited to use activist government to protect them in anxious economic times.Older Democrats and minority voters provided a ""firewall"" that allowed Mrs. Clinton to defeat her rival in the primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Democrats who call themselves ""somewhat liberal"" went for Hillary by 13 percentage points, according to exit poll data analyzed by Public Opinion Strategies. ""Moderates"" backed her by 23 percentage points. But among the quarter of Democrats who see themselves as ""very liberal,"" she ran even with the socialist.Bernie Sanders and his activist supporters have moved Mrs. Clinton and the party's platform to the left. The result is that the Democrats have taken on an identity that comes from a new base: voters under 40 who have no problem with Mr. Sanders's socialist vision. A 2015 study by the Pew Research Center found that 51% of millennials ""identify as Democrats or lean Democratic,"" compared with only 35% for Republicans. Two-fifths of millennials are people of color and immigrants.This is not your father's -- or even your older sister's -- Democratic Party. It is far more left-leaning than under Bill Clinton or President Obama.Almost 60% of Democratic voters agree that ""socialism has a positive"" impact on society, according to a February poll by OnMessage Inc. and the American Action Network. In Iowa 43% of Democrats said in January that they would use the word ""socialist"" to describe themselves, a survey by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics found.Forty-seven percent of Democrats told Gallup last year that they are both ""socially liberal and economically moderate/liberal"" -- the highest level in the poll's history. In 2001 only 30% of Democrats described themselves that way. Between 2000 and 2015 the percentage of ""Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters"" who consider themselves liberal has gone up to 42% from 27%, according to a Pew study in February.Mrs. Clinton has been running to the front of this liberal parade. This month she wrapped her arms around one of Mr. Sanders's biggest causes by backing tuition-free college at in-state public universities for families making under $125,000 a year.She broke with Mr. Obama by calling for repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax on health-insurance plans, a priority for labor unions. She gave a sop to the teachers unions by backtracking on her decades-old support for charter schools. It is clear that in this new liberal order of Democratic politics, the unions will be the enforcers.Mrs. Clinton is now even backing a ""public option"" -- a Medicare-style government program to compete against private insurance companies. This idea was so radioactive during the debate over the Affordable Care Act that Democrats jettisoned it for fear of being tarred as proponents of socialized medicine.With the implicit support of Mrs. Clinton and her allies, the Sanders coalition added language to the Democratic platform calling to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, put a price on climate-altering emissions like carbon, and abolish the death penalty.The party also stripped out language supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr. Sanders opposed during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton had once praised the deal a ""gold standard,"" but last fall she withdrew her support.""It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,"" Mr. Sanders said this month as he endorsed her in New Hampshire. He correctly noted that the threat of a divided party had forced Mrs. Clinton to accept ""the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.""Mr. Sanders then urged his supporters to keep the pressure on: ""Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency -- and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen."" The Vermonter has a stronger hand to play after the success of his populist campaign.Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress have become more liberal -- the mirror image of what has happened to the GOP. Democratic incumbents who were defeated during the Obama years were largely centrists from red states: Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska.After the 2012 election, much was written, including by me, about whether the Obama coalition of young people, blacks, Hispanics, gays and single women would keep Democrats in the White House for the near future. No one predicted that first of these core constituencies, young people, would become so vocally liberal.A final factor is the GOP's strategy of unrelenting obstructionism against President Obama, which sparked a low-grade fury among the left wing. This is why Monday night's convention speaker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, gets hundreds of thousands of views every time she posts a fiery speech on YouTube.Senate Republicans have refused to have a hearing, much less a vote, on Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even refused to give Mr. Garland the courtesy of a simple introductory meeting.The result is that the bare-knuckle, activist-driven, take-to-the-streets politics of Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter is becoming the rule among Democrats. This month Senate Democrats blocked Republican efforts to defund so-called sanctuary cities and impose harsh prison sentences on undocumented immigrants.History will record this week's convention as a coming-of-age for a new era of liberal Democratic politics. This is now Bernie Sanders's party: Other Democrats -- including Hillary Clinton -- are merely living in it.---Mr. Williams, a political analyst for Fox News and columnist for the Hill, is the author of ""We the People: The Modern-Day Figures Who Have Reshaped and Affirmed the Founding Fathers' Vision of America"" (Crown. 2016).(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Bernie Won the War, Making U.S. Less Special"" -- WSJ August 5, 2016)Credit: By Juan Williams",10/20/16
Election at Bernie's,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825766840?accountid=12768,"It's election season, which means Democrats are again pushing the line that voter fraud is a myth. Allow us to introduce them to the 19 dead registered voters in Harrisonburg, Virginia.Harrisonburg Registrar Debbie Logan late last week acknowledged that her office had fielded 19 fraudulent applications, submitted under the names of dead Virginians. The fraud came to light because a long-time clerk saw an application under the name of Richard Claybrook Sr., the deceased father of a well-known local judge. The elder Claybrook died in 2014.According to news reports, investigators have obtained a confession from Andrew Spieles, a James Madison University student working for a voter registration shop called HarrisonburgVOTES. The outfit purports to be nonpartisan, but it is run by Joe Fitzgerald, the chairman of his congressional district's Democratic Committee, and Mr. Spieles is a member of Virginia Young Democrats.Mr. Fitzgerald told reporters that he fired Mr. Spieles after he confessed, and no charges have been filed, though officials say the investigation continues. Meanwhile, the Colorado Secretary of State is investigating another case of Election at Bernie's, after a local CBS affiliate uncovered multiple instances of dead Coloradans who cast ballots in recent elections.Democrats are already saying the dead Harrisonburg 19 are no big deal, with Virginia House Minority Leader David Toscano claiming there was no voter fraud because ""they caught him"" before the votes were cast. Which is like saying it wasn't a robbery because the thief was caught carrying the TV out of the house.Democrats push the fraud-is-a-myth theme because it furthers their political goal of portraying any ballot-security measure as racist in order to drive minority turnout. But the integrity of the ballot matters as much as access to the ballot, and every fraudulent vote cancels a legitimate one. With trust in democratic institutions already frayed, the country doesn't need elections that are tainted by voter fraud, which is no myth.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: The Politics of Eternal Life"" -- WSJ Oct. 22, 2016)",10/21/16
"For Sanders Army, Fight Isn't Over",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806616345?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Sen. Bernie Sanders raised an angry army to propel him through this year's presidential primaries. He didn't win that war, but his foot-soldiers showed on Monday they had one more battle they wanted to fight.That fight unfolded here on the first day of the Democratic Party's national convention. Sanders supporters took to the streets, to the hotel ballrooms where state delegations were meeting and ultimately to the floor of the convention itself to vent their unhappiness with the way they say they were treated by the party, and with their party's nominee-to-be, Hillary Clinton.By night's end, the Sanders forces were able to turn from jeering to cheering when Mr. Sanders spoke to the convention and gave a full-throated endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. Still, the day served noticed that, having barged into the party's inner sanctum, they won't exit quietly. Mr. Sanders himself, during his prime-time speech, said his political ""revolution"" would continue.As the day began, they booed their ousted national chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, at a meeting of her home-state Florida delegation because of newly disclosed emails showing that, under her, the party's apparatus had been eager to help Mrs. Clinton and put down Mr. Sanders. They booed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D. Calif.), long a stalwart of the party's liberal wing, presumably because of her support for Mrs. Clinton.They even booed their hero, Mr. Sanders, at a morning rally when he urged them to unite behind Mrs. Clinton.By the time the convention formally opened just after 4 p.m., the Sanders backers had succeeded in scaring Ms. Wasserman Schultz off the convention stage entirely; she declined to open the convention proceedings as planned, knowing that her appearance would have produced a cascade of boos and catcalls.Yet that victory didn't calm the pro-Sanders camp, at least not entirely. As the convention opened, every time Mrs. Clinton's name was spoken, boos and jeers were heard. The testiness between the Sanders and Clinton forces were obvious; after hearing the heckling, Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, the permanent chair of the convention, scolded the audience.""I will be respectful of you and I want you to be respectful of me,"" she said. ""We are all Democrats and we need to act like it."" Similarly, former Denver mayor Wellington Webb, a Clinton supporter, urged the crowd to cheer not one candidate or the other, but to cheer both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton.Hundreds of Sanders supporters streamed into the Pennsylvania Convention Center to hear Mr. Sanders's Monday-afternoon speech, chanting ""Feel the Bern"" as they did so. They were skeptical of Mrs. Clinton's liberal credentials -- but even more agitated at the email disclosure that they said showed the party's pro-Clinton bias.""I just feel like if they really were sincere, then the whole party would be standing up and saying this is not acceptable and we don't agree with it,"" said Susan Hall, a delegate for Mr. Sanders from Scranton, Pa. Ms. Hall said that Mr. Sanders had backed Mrs. Clinton for strategic reasons and that she would ""follow his lead.""Rob Deppert, an alternate delegate from Indiana, wore a green Robin Hood hat handed out by a nurses union seeking to highlight Mr. Sanders's call to tax the rich to benefit the less well-off. Mr. Deppert complained that the emails showed ""basically that the Democratic National Committee had its thumb on the scales and was working with the press to limit Bernie's access,"" producing a ""rigged process.""Meanwhile, out on the streets of Philadelphia, protesters braved temperatures of nearly 100 degrees to support Mr. Sanders.A spirited crowd gathered outside the entrance to the convention, shouting to passing delegates and carrying signs calling for Mr. Sanders to be made the nominee.They chanted, ""Hell no, DNC, we won't vote for Hillary,"" and, ""A vote for Hillary is a vote for Trump."" Others carried signs calling for Mrs. Clinton to be indicted or jailed over her use of email while secretary of state. Police handcuffed a number of demonstrators but didn't arrest them. Instead, the police issued 54 citations for disorderly conduct.""We need Bernie -- we need what he represents to the American people. The American people need the government to represent what it needs,"" said Michelle Gale, a 28-year old who traveled from Chicago to demonstrate. ""We do not want Hillary.""Almost lost in the hubbub was the more substantive impact of the Sanders insurrection -- victories his supporters seemed to almost look past. The convention adopted by acclamation the most liberal platform in decades, which moved toward Sanders positions on the minimum wage, trade and college costs.The party also moved to appease the Sanders army's complaints about the structure of party primaries, adopting a plan to reduce the role of so-called superdelegates -- party leaders who are automatically made delegates to the party's convention and free to support the candidate of their choice.Mr. Sanders and his supporters complained frequently and vociferously that the superdelegates gave Mrs. Clinton an unfair advantage, though she defeated him in both popular votes and other delegates in the party's primaries and caucuses.""We've won this by standing up,"" says Maine state Rep. Diane Russell, commenting on the Democratic Party's decision to appoint a committee with an eye to overhauling the role of superdelegates. ""We did this. We won this by standing together,"" she shouted, eliciting cheers of ""Bernie, Bernie!""But she closed her remarks by saying she would do everything she could to ensure Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency -- a needed boost at a convention with plenty of intraparty divisions.As that suggested, the Sanders insurrection was quieting down by the time evening fell, in part because leaders of the Sanders and Clinton campaigns joined forces to calm the atmosphere. Mr. Sanders, even before his speech, again made clear to his followers that he wanted them to swing behind the party's nominee.Still, the day showed that the Sanders army isn't interested in disbanding, and may have longer-term ambitions for the party it has rocked.Credit: By Siobhan Hughes and Byron Tau",10/21/16
The Democratic Convention: Emails Show DNC Taking Aim at Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806616179?accountid=12768,"Private emails released Friday by the WikiLeaks website have rocked the Democratic Party at its convention this week, just as party leaders aim to appear unified behind presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.The hacked emails, which appear to show evidence of a continuing rift between the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's primary rival, Bernie Sanders, caused an uproar among the Vermont senator's supporters, who alleged during the primary that the DNC was unfairly tipping the scale in favor of Mrs. Clinton.DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is stepping down from her role in light of the email leak.Brian Fallon, press secretary for Mrs. Clinton, told reporters Monday that the campaign doesn't condone the content of the leaked emails, singling out as particularly egregious one message that questioned Mr. Sanders's Jewish faith and suggested casting the Vermont senator as an atheist. The DNC in a statement apologized to Mr. Sanders about the emails.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Monday the role played by staffers at the DNC ""should be scrutinized"" and others dismissed if warranted. Donna Brazile, who will serve as interim DNC chairwoman, said she would conduct a probe before making any decisions about whether additional officials should lose their jobs.Of the more than 19,000 emails sent from DNC officials between early 2015 and mid-2016 that were dumped online by WikiLeaks (and are available by search), here are nine that standout:-- April 24, 2016: DNC officials discuss a TV appearance that day by Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Communications Director Luis Miranda writes, ""She can't take Sanders on directly, it would turn into a fight and any time it's DNC Chair vs Sanders, DNC Chair is going to lose.""-- April 24, 2016: Ms. Wasserman Schultz, responding to an email about Mr. Sanders's saying he will stay in the primary race until the end, writes, ""Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.""-- May 5, 2016: DNC officials appear to suggest a plan to bring Mr. Sanders's religion into the primary narrative. In an email from Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall to Chief Executive Amy Dacey, Mr. Marshall writes, ""It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist.""In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr. Marshall apologized for what he called ""insensitive, emotional emails.""-- May 13, 2016: In an email to DNC press secretary Mark Paustenbach, Ms. Wasserman Schultz calls Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver ""an ASS"" for his comments about taking the primary fight to the convention.-- May 17, 2016: When sent Mr. Weaver's comments on Sanders supporters protesting in Nevada, Ms. Wasserman Schultz says, ""Damn liar. Particularly scummy that he barely acknowledges the violent and threatening behavior that occurred.""Mr. Weaver had called on protesters to act civilly, but accused the Nevada state party of ignoring votes from the floor of the state convention.-- May 18, 2016: Ms. Wasserman Schultz writes to MSNBC's Chuck Todd asking to discuss unfavorable coverage from the network's program, ""Morning Joe."" The email's subject line is, ""Chuck, this must stop.""-- May 18, 2016: Christina Freundlich, DNC deputy communications director, asks for approval to post a fake job listing on Craigslist for women who want to apply to jobs at one of Donald Trump's organizations. The requirements for the job, listed in the email, include ""no gaining weight on the job"" and ""must be open to public humiliation and open-press workouts if you do gain weight on the job.""-- May 21, 2016: The communications team floats the idea of creating an anti-Sanders narrative. Mr. Paustenbach emails Mr. Miranda: ""Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess.""-- May 21, 2016: Responding to Mr. Sanders's remarks that he would not reappoint Ms. Wasserman Schultz if he were elected president, the DNC chairwoman writes, ""This is a silly story.

""I honestly don't know many of the people there. But my guess is we're going to need new leadership, a new direction and new personnel.""Asked after the event whether Mr. Sanders considers himself a Democrat or an independent, a campaign aide said, ""He ran for president as a Democrat but was elected to a six-year term in the Senate as an independent.""Mr. Sanders's appearance followed his prime-time speech Monday in which he urged his supporters to back Hillary Clinton. As for his own future in the party, he said he would remain an independent as he serves out his senate term.Vermont has no party registration. But when Mr. Sanders entered the presidential race last year he proclaimed himself a Democrat.The emails, released by WikiLeaks, appear to show DNC aides plotting ways to undermine Mr. Sanders's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.On the eve of the four-day convention devoted to Mrs. Clinton's nomination, Ms. Wasserman Schultz announced she was stepping down as chairwoman. She has played no public role in the convention proceedings.Mr. Sanders cast the DNC as an inept operation that has failed to inspire people to vote, resulting in large Democratic losses in years when the president isn't on the ballot.He said the DNC needs new ""leadership and a new chair that would lead the process of transforming the Democratic Party.""Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic official, has stepped in as interim chairwoman.

The delay afforded us the opportunity to see a good cross-section of DNC speakers. By far the star of the evening was Michelle Obama, who denounced Donald Trump as a bad influence on children.She described the Obamas' consciousness of being role models: ""We know that our words and actions matter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country. . . . Kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband, his eyes wide with hope, and he wondered, 'Is my hair like yours?'""She's got a point: Imagine a little kid looking at Mr. Trump and asking, ""Is my hair like yours?""It's something of a role reversal that Democrats are portraying themselves as wholesome vs. the transgressive Republicans, but it's certainly fitting given the public personae of the Obamas and Mr. Trump. Mrs. Obama had high praise for Hillary Clinton but didn't mention her until after the role-model riff.Mrs. Obama also took issue with Trump's slogan: ""Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again. Because this right now is the greatest country on earth!"" Her happy talk was in contrast with the later speeches of Elizabeth Warren and Mr. Sanders, both of which were, if we may employ a five-day-old cliche, dark.""America isn't going broke,"" Ms. Warren said, striking a deceptively optimistic note: ""There's lots of wealth in America, but it isn't trickling down to hard-working families like yours. . . . People get it: The system is rigged.""You know who else said the system is rigged?The crowd's response to Ms. Warren was notably tepid, especially by comparison with Mrs. Obama. At several points she was heckled.Likewise Mr. Sanders's speech was dark. He spoke of ""the 40-year decline of our middle class,"" the likelihood that ""our younger generation will . . . have a lower standard of living than their parents,"" and ""the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality.""Nor were the cheers for him very enthusiastic -- except toward the end, when he called for ""strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership."" Mr. Trump couldn't have said it better.Sanders supporters booed when he exhorted them to vote for Mrs. Clinton. Earlier, Sarah Silverman had appeared with Sen. Al Franken in the dullest assemblage of former ""Saturday Night Live"" talent since Norm Macdonald dined alone. As the Chicago Tribune notes, Ms. Silverman, who supported Mr. Sanders, said: ""Can I just say to the 'Bernie or bust' people, you're being ridiculous.""She has a point -- and so does Mr. Sanders. If you want a socialist America, Mr. Sanders was the best of the candidates seeking either party's nomination. But Mrs. Clinton, bad as she is, is obviously better by lefty lights than Mr. Trump.Credit: By James Taranto",10/24/16

Long Before The Bernie Bros,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811510216?accountid=12768,"The Virgin VoteBy Jon Grinspan(North Carolina, 256 pages, $28)It is often taken as a good thing when young people show an interest in politics -- especially, it seems, when they vote to the left of their elders. In 1972, for example, young voters split evenly between Richard Nixon and George McGovern, and in 2012 they provided pretty much all of Barack Obama's popular-vote margin.But these were not the peak years of young Americans' influence on electoral politics. The peak came in the turbulent politics of the pre-Civil War years and the decades after, roughly 1840 to 1900. The period is chronicled in vivid and loving detail by Jon Grinspan, a historian and Smithsonian curator, in ""The Virgin Vote.""The book's title comes not from the snarky 2012 campaign video -- the one using double-entendre to encourage young women to vote for Barack Obama -- but from a label proudly self-applied in the 19th century by young men who were casting their vote for the first time. ""Virgin voters were likely to vote in groups, often joined by brothers, father and friends,"" Mr. Grinspan writes. And the commotion attracted notice: ""While young men fluffed their beards, donned new hats and headed off to the polls, their sisters looked on with a combination of support, pride and -- sometimes -- resentment.""Virgin voting and active electioneering were well-nigh universal in mid- and late 19th-century America. From 1840 to 1900, Mr. Grinspan says, between 70% and 80% of those eligible to vote did so in every presidential election, more than ever before or since. Young women were active as well, canvassing and participating in rallies. Young free blacks voted, too, until they were blocked from the polls by Democratic politicians and the Ku Klux Klan.Drawing on a wide range of scholarship and dozens of diaries, Mr. Grinspan tells his story more in personal than statistical terms. We see 19-year-old Oscar Lawrence Jackson orating for Abraham Lincoln in southern Ohio in 1860; 15-year-old George Washington Albright sneaking out at night to tell other slaves on nearby Mississippi plantations about the Emancipation Proclamation; 16-year-old James Witham arguing politics in the caboose of a westbound train in Nebraska in 1872.In some of these accounts we hear serious arguments about politics and policy, but they also include ridicule and rowdiness, alcohol consumption and tobacco expectoration, flirting and frivolity, and roving gangs of young men like Lincoln's Wide Awake boys, who prowled at the edge of crowds looking for trouble. Altogether Mr. Grinspan's narrative is a riveting picture of 19th-century politicking.And a picture in some ways unsettling. Young Americans tended to inherit their political views from their elders and, in this supercharged political atmosphere, tended to stick with the party they supported with their virgin votes. There were some exceptions -- Mr. Grinspan zeroes in on the party-switching and ultimately nonpartisan author William Dean Howells -- but party loyalties then seem much like loyalties to sports teams today: You keep rooting for the Yankees or the Cowboys regardless of changes in players and coaches and owners, overlooking the team's weaknesses and excusing its fouls. Sometimes old parties disappear and new ones are formed, as in the 1850s, just as sports leagues expand and teams relocate. But mostly this was a period, not unlike our two most recent decades, of static partisan divisions, with just a few votes making the difference between victory and defeat.Yet the rough-and-ready politics of such a time had to deal with the great, and greatly divisive, issues of slavery and civil rights, which accounted for some of the fervor of the virgin voters. One reads Mr. Grinspan's chapter on Oscar Lawrence Jackson's 1860 speech aware that the victory of his candidate culminated in a civil war in which 600,000 died -- and in which Jackson himself survived a shot in the face. He was elected to Congress in the 1880s and died in 1920.By that time the age of the virgin voter was long over. Voter participation began to fall off in the 1890s. One reason was reform, starting with the ballot itself. Initially each political party printed ballots with only its own candidates listed. The ballots were distributed to would-be virgin voters by armies of young men on Election Day. Between 1887 and 1896, to prevent ballot-box stuffing and discourage straight-ticket voting, most states adopted the so-called Australian ballot, which listed candidates of all parties and was handed out by election clerks. Casting votes, including virgin votes, became a perfunctory matter, Mr. Grinspan notes, rather than a theatrical performance.For the youth of this period, politics was clearly a form of entertainment, but it eventually met competition: The bicycle craze, the rise of team sports like baseball and the growth of vaudeville provided other pastimes and venues where young men and women could spend time together. By the 1890s, Mr. Grinspan writes, ""youth and politics were quietly untangling themselves."" Even as the potential electorate was expanded by women's suffrage and the naturalization of Ellis Island immigrants, political participation and voter turnout declined.Should we wish for a revival of young people's participation in politics? Implicitly throughout and explicitly in an afterword, the author answers ""yes."" Amid so many distractions, he argues, the key ""to getting young people involved in politics, regardless of brain chemistry or habits, is to raise them in a culture that cares.""A skeptic may question whether the quality of the election result is improved by the participation of the otherwise indifferent and whether a caring culture will always care wisely. ""The Virgin Vote"" plunges readers into a pulsating political culture long vanished -- and unlikely to be revived in a year when most young voters dislike both major parties' presidential nominees.---Mr. Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and co-author of ""The Almanac of American Politics.""Credit: By Michael Barone",11/7/16
