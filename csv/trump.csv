Iowa Takes a Cruz; And Trump is the night's biggest loser.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761647081?accountid=12768,"""The American political revolution appears to be exaggerated . Iowa Republicans played to their social conservative form Monday by vaulting Ted Cruz to victory over Donald Trump,"" notes a Journal editorial , while ""Democrats were narrowly turning back Bernie Sanders's populist challenge in favor of Hillary Clinton's interest-group machine .""""The night's biggest loser, to borrow a word, was Mr. Trump,"" adds the editorial board , and his ""speech on Monday night was, to borrow another phrase, low-energy."" Meanwhile the close Democratic contest ""shows Mrs. Clinton's weakness as a candidate , but it also reveals that the Democratic Party's most powerful interest groups can still unite against a progressive populist.""The progressive populist has been pulling Mrs. Clinton to the left, and that spells trouble down the road for Team Clinton, writes our columnist William McGurn . Conventional wisdom is that an increasingly diverse electorate no longer responds to the conservative message of limited government and low taxes. But Mr. McGurn notes that pollster Ed Goeas carried out a recent survey ""zeroing in on voters who describe themselves as middle class, which works out to 70% of the electorate. The survey confirmed they are unhappy--but it finds they are specifically unhappy with President Obama and a federalgovernment that does not provide them value for their tax dollars.""""Joe Biden is leading a White House 'moonshot' to cure cancer by 2020,"" observes a Journal editorial . ""Along the way maybe he can warn his fellow politicians to stop undermining medical advances with price controls."" Gilead Sciences is under fire from leftist pols ""for having all but cured Hepatitis C"" with its medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni.Things may look bad in China right now but Andy Kessler advises that ""while everyone else scours the latest news over the GDP numbers and the Shanghai stock index, look closer: On Sunday came the announcement that China's purchasing managers index had fallen for the sixth straight month--but consumer retail sales in China were up 10.7% last year. The Chinese consumer is waking up .""The Department of Education is holding 139 million Social Security numbers in its digital files and hands out roughly $100 billion in loans each year but earns failing grades when it comes to information security . Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the agency's chief information officer was employing subordinates in outside business ventures installing home theaters and detailing cars .Things aren't looking much better at the Labor Department. Former Chief Economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth estimates a new Obama rule intended to prevent employers from making the case against unionization could cost up to $10.5 billion in year one . ""But my estimate is too low, because it does not include the potential legal costs if there are reporting errors"" in new forms that will be required, she adds .Also today, columnist Bret Stephens doesn't find much to like in the top two vote-getters in either party, and Harvard Med student Nathaniel Morris says that psychiatry still carries a stigma in the medical community.Credit: By James Freeman",2/2/16
Ted Cruz Beats Donald Trump in Iowa's GOP Race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761583439?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, Iowa--Texas Sen. Ted Cruz outmuscled Donald Trump to win the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses on Monday, delivering a stinging rebuke to the celebrity businessman and establishing himself as a leading contender for the GOP nomination.The results Monday set the stage for a series of high-stakes showdowns in the weeks ahead between the top two finishers and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose appeal as a general-election candidate was good enough for a late surge that nearly overtook Mr. Trump.""Tonight is a victory for the grass roots,"" said Mr. Cruz to a raucous victory party in Des Moines. ""Tonight is a victory for millions of Americans who have shouldered the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok.""Mr. Trump kept his post-caucus remarks brief, thanking his family and the state of Iowa before turning his attention to contests that follow. ""We love New Hampshire, we love South Carolina,"" he said.Election 2016* Clinton, Sanders Dig In for Long Battle After Iowa Photo Finish* Capital Journal: Front-Runners Give Ground as Rivals Make Mark* Cruz, Rubio Shift the GOP Conversation* Cruz's Win Powered by Evangelicals*New Hampshire Primary Is an Unpredictable One* Campaign-Finance Reports Portend Lengthy Battle* Photos: Iowa Caucuses Kick Off U.S. Presidential ElectionThe race in Iowa exposed cracks in Mr. Trump's front-runner status. After a six-month ride atop the polls, his stardom wasn't enough to overcome Mr. Cruz's superior turnout machine and the Texan's appeal with the party's most conservative voters.With 99% of the precincts reporting, Mr. Cruz led the GOP field as the top pick of 27.7% of Republican caucusgoers, followed by Mr. Trump at 24.3% and Mr. Rubio at 23.1%.Mr. Cruz's victory was a remarkable turnaround for a candidate who entered the race as a little-known long shot, his rise a reflection of how much the GOP is now moved by the tea party and evangelical voters who have flocked to him.The Texan generated his highest levels of support in Iowa from the most conservative caucusgoers, according to an entrance poll conducted for news organizations. He also performed well among evangelicals and Republicans who said he shared their values.Mr. Rubio's late surge will increase interest in his candidacy and ratchet up the pressure on less-viable Republicans to drop out of the race to give more centrist, business-friendly voters a clearer alternative to Messrs. Cruz and Trump.""For months, they told us we had no chance,"" Mr. Rubio told hundreds of cheering supporters Monday night. ""Tonight, here in Iowa, the people of this great state sent a very clear message.""Mr. Rubio outpaced his rivals by big margins on the question of which candidate Republicans think can win in November, the entrance poll showed. He also built a big edge among caucusgoers who want the next president to be experienced. Those will be strong selling points in states where the electorate is less conservative than Iowa.Messrs. Cruz and Trump had traded increasingly nasty barbs in the run-up to Iowa, setting up for a more bitter battle to follow. Mr. Trump has picked fights with rivals, major media organizations and party leaders in Washington, frequent skirmishes that have allowed him to dominate news coverage and drown out other Republicans with more typical resumes.The Iowa results cement the top tier of the Republican field, and most of the contenders are expected to continue on to New Hampshire. But former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was a casualty of the Iowa caucuses, announcing on Twitter that he was withdrawing from the race.Mr. Trump will get a chance to re-establish himself in states where polls show him up by as much as 20 percentage points--although he had led in most Iowa polls before the caucuses began.In addition, many back-of-the-pack contenders ended 2015 with enough money to finance bare-bones campaigns through the first four nominating states in February, new campaign-finance reports suggest.""These first four races are going to set the playoffs,"" said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid. ""To advance, you need to do well in these first four.""Republicans may have to wait until the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20 or possibly Super Tuesday on March 1 to get a clearer sense of which of the candidates have the strongest claim on the nomination.Anger and frustration were defining features of the GOP electorate . Half described themselves as ""dissatisfied, but not angry"" about the way the federal government is working.A somewhat smaller share said they were outright angry. And half of those Republicans who participated said they wanted the next president to be from outside the political establishment.Big crowds flocked to caucus sites around the state, and early surveys suggested the share of first-time caucusgoers had ticked up from 2012.Total GOP turnout topped 184,000 voters, shattering the previous record of roughly 121,000 caucusgoers. A GOP precinct in Van Meter ran out of ballots and forms to register new voters. ""We're way past capacity,"" said Bev McLinden, a local GOP official.There were pockets of the state where Mr. Trump didn't register any support. At a caucus meeting in Pleasant Hill, none of the hundreds of Republicans in attendance rose to speak on his behalf. ""They said he had no ground game,"" said Mary Dorin, a Cruz supporter.At a caucus in Cedar Rapids, Mr. Cruz made his own case to the assembled voters, telling them he has the money to compete late into the nominating calendar by citing his conservatism and his ability to win a general election.Mr. Trump's improbable rise already has turned the race on its ear. The billionaire barely registered in public-opinion surveys last spring when he started making noise about a possible presidential bid, trailing by wide margins both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race in September.Mr. Trump drew his highest levels of support from caucusgoers who didn't attend college, were more moderate and, first and foremost, listed immigration as their top issue, the entrance poll showed. He also drew higher support from caucusgoers eager for an outsider.First-time caucusgoer Rachael Schwartz, 28, the mother of an 18-month-old daughter, said she likes Mr. Trump because he is outspoken and would let people make more decisions about their lives, such as whether to vaccinate their children. ""I never paid attention to the future, and now it's important to me,"" she said. ""I believe he's for the people, and we will truly have a voice.""Mr. Trump's often-incendiary campaign rhetoric has turned off some would-be supporters who otherwise appreciate his brash style. Valerie Martin, 36, a nurse midwife who attended the Cruz event in Jefferson, was leaning toward Mr. Trump before settling on his main rival. ""I don't know how he will be taken by other countries,"" she said.Viability was a big lure on Monday as Republicans who planned to back other candidates decided to support one of the top-three.Landon Myer, a quarry worker from Claire, Iowa was leaning toward Mr. Cruz, after considering Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. ""Cruz is the only one that's going to stop Trump,"" said Mr. Myer. ""I feel a vote for Rand Paul is a wasted vote.""Ben Kesling contributed to this article.Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.comCredit: By Patrick O'Connor and Janet Hook",2/3/16
"Front-Runners Give Ground as Rivals Make Mark in Iowa; Donald Trump fell short, Hillary Clinton flirted with disaster, and their main rivals had strong nights",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761499776?accountid=12768,"Ted Cruz did what he had to do. Donald Trump fell well short of the shock-and-awe moment he hoped would set up a blitz through the rest of the country. Marco Rubio bought himself a seat at the big table. And Hillary Clinton flirted all night with disaster.Those were the big story lines that emerged from Iowa's caucuses Monday night. It's early--ridiculously early, actually--to draw too many conclusions. But the results suggested that a fight still lies ahead on the Democratic side, and a potentially much bigger and longer battle is ahead on the Republican one.Perhaps most important, the Iowa results suggest that those fights will take place in two parties deeply divided between insiders and outsiders, between young and old, and between the most and least wealthy. The situation is volatile, and, as a consequence, unpredictable.Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 news.* Cruz Beats Trump in Iowa's GOP Race* Clinton and Sanders Dig In for Long Battle* Presidential Candidates Focus on New Hampshire* Cruz, Rubio Shift the GOP Conversation* Cruz's Win Powered by Evangelicals* New Hampshire Primary Is an Unpredictable One* Campaign-Finance Reports Portend Lengthy BattleBy late last night, it was clear that Mr. Cruz rode his strong support among evangelical conservatives to a victory. He had to do that to be a viable long-term candidate; if he couldn't charge ahead in a state where evangelical voters traditionally have an outsize influence, his candidacy would have been seriously compromised.Mr. Trump calculated that he could make a late surge in Iowa, put away Mr. Cruz and pave the way for a big win in New Hampshire to start putting away the competition. That didn't happen. His brand has been that he is a winner; it remains to be seen what the Iowa outcome does to that brand.On the other hand, Mr. Rubio simply needed to do well enough to establish himself as the third player in a three-handed game of high-stakes poker going forward. He did more than that--much more, in fact. He was the one candidate who significantly outperformed expectations, and that gives him the biggest dose of rocket fuel out of Iowa.On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton was clinging to a narrow lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders through the night. In mathematical terms, they had fought nearly to a draw, and that carries Mr. Sanders to New Hampshire's primary strong enough to be the favorite there, next door to his home state of Vermont.But his road is much rougher after that, as the race moves south and west to Clinton strongholds. In that sense, the key for Mrs. Clinton was simply to avoid embarrassment in Iowa.So nothing is settled, and nothing was destined to be. Yet Iowa's importance may lie elsewhere, for the results tell us much about two parties that are in significant flux.On the GOP side, Mr. Trump has charged in and either pulled in alongside, or consolidated behind him, the votes of nontraditional Republicans: less-educated, lower-income and deeply unhappy with the party's leaders.Indeed, entrance polls showed that Mr. Trump won among Republicans with a high school education or less, lost among college graduates and those with post-graduate degrees. He won in rural areas, not in cities and suburbs. His widest margin of victory was among those who wanted somebody from outside the establishment.Meanwhile, Mr. Rubio emerges looking an awful lot like the man mainstream party voters can embrace. His support was fairly even across age and demographic groups, but it bulged among Republicans whose top priority was simply finding a candidate who could win the general election in November. Among those voters, Mr. Rubio led Mr. Trump 44% to 24%.He prevailed among voters who wanted experience in politics rather than somebody from outside the establishment. And he won among those who decided whom to support in the last few days--suggesting, at least, that Republicans agonizing about their decision decided to choose a safe bet rather than make some kind of statement.And Mr. Cruz? He fell into a familiar Republican lane, winning among evangelicals and the party's most conservative voters. Those are voters not comfortable with Mr. Trump and not convinced of Mr. Rubio.Among Democrats, the splits are even more vivid. They have a giant age gap: Mr. Sanders won by a huge margin among young voters, Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin among the oldest voters. They have a significant gender gap: Mrs. Clinton won by a hefty 10 percentage points among women, the entrance polls showed, while Mr. Sanders won among men by seven percentage points.Mr. Sanders won convincingly among the lowest-income Democratic voters. Mrs. Clinton won convincingly among the highest-income Democratic voters. He won easily among very liberal voters. She won easily among moderates.Caucuses and primaries bring out the divides, of course, but these are surprising ones in an unconventional year. And they may not close anytime soon.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",2/3/16
"Why Mike Bloomberg Can Win; Record numbers of voters are independents--who won't be satisfied with Clinton, Trump or Cruz.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762223569?accountid=12768,"As the results from the Iowa caucuses rolled in Monday, it became more clear than ever: If former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ran for president as an independent, he would be a serious contender for the White House. I work for Mr. Bloomberg as a pollster, and as this campaign has unfolded I have been struck by the gap between voters' concerns and how the media has portrayed them.Talking heads say that voters are angry and polarized. This misses the mass of Americans in the middle. Only 16% of voters participated in a primary or caucus four years ago, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Even the strong turnout Monday--more than 180,000 Republicans and 170,000 Democrats--represents a mere fifth of the 1.6 million Iowans who voted in November 2012.That's the new silent majority: the millions of Americans who don't participate in Democratic or Republican primaries. They are equally as fed up with the status quo, but they have a different approach to problem-solving and different policy prescriptions than those on the ideological extremes.The bulk of the people who voted in Iowa were distinctively liberal or conservative. Of Republicans caucusgoers, only 14% said they were moderates, down one percentage point from 2012. Of the Democrats, 28% were moderates, down 12 points from 2008. It shows in the results: Half of the GOP caucusgoers supported either Ted Cruz, the most dogmatic conservative, or Donald Trump, the bombastic populist. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders is leading a lurch toward socialism, and Hillary Clinton is seeking to match if not exceed his leftist agenda.Who is appealing to the center? Most Americans, the new silent majority, do not share the aims of the activist caucusgoers. The share of voters who identify as independents hit 43% last year, a new record according to Gallup . Only 26% were Republicans and 30% Democrats. Moreover, 60% of Americans told Gallup in September that the Republicans and Democrats ""do such a poor job"" representing them that they want to see a third major party emerge. That's up from 40% when the question was first asked in 2003.Who fits the bill? Michael Bloomberg, a centrist with a clear (and arguably unique) record in business as an entrepreneur and in politics as a three-term mayor of New York. Mr. Bloomberg is a fiscally prudent conciliator who advances pro-growth policies and takes tough stands. He supports comprehensive immigration reform to strengthen the American economy, environmental protections to protect our planet for the next generation, and social policies to promote inclusiveness, public health and community safety. In short, his agenda is very different from what is being offered by Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio or Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.As America becomes more polarized, the desire grows for a candidate in the center focused on building consensus and getting results. This is the hidden message of Monday's caucuses, the one that Mr. Bloomberg is contemplating as he considers a run for president.The numbers bear this out: Shortly after the 2014 election a poll by this newspaper and NBC News showed that 63% of Americans favored compromise, not confrontation, to achieve policy goals. A majority, 52%, wanted the government to do more problem-solving. These attitudes suggest a constituency for a candidate who eschews partisanship and produces results. That's exactly what Mr. Bloomberg did in New York, and what he has advocated for 10 years in speeches on reforming the political system and fixing Washington.A January poll by Frank Luntz--which was not commissioned by Mr. Bloomberg or me--illustrates the mayor's potential. Mr. Luntz, who advised Ross Perot's independent bid in 1992, found that 84% of voters could support a generic candidate who matches Mr. Bloomberg's profile. When asked about the former mayor by name, 55% said they would consider supporting him. That includes 57% of Democrats, 45% of Republicans, and 62% of swing voters.In direct matchups--three-way races against Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Cruz, or Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Rubio--the poll puts Mr. Bloomberg at 28%, and the election almost within the margin of error. And that's before he has announced a candidacy or run a single ad.In short, the Bloomberg message would be unique in a year when Republicans have moved sharply to the right, and Democrats sharply to the left. The Luntz survey shows that more than a third of voters, 35%, either have no opinion about Mr. Bloomberg or have never heard of him. That gives him huge potential for growth among voters who are disappointed and dissatisfied with the two major parties.The past two independents to begin presidential candidacies from the center were not successful. In 1992 Mr. Perot went as high as 37% in the polls, but finished with 19% of the popular vote. In 1980 John Anderson hit the mid-20s, but then stalled and won only 7% on Election Day. But their candidacies were sunk by poor temperament, meager resources or an inability to get on the ballot. Mr. Bloomberg would have none of those problems.Commentators have mistakenly characterized Mr. Bloomberg's mayoral tenure as exclusively focused on a relatively limited (but widely known) social and public health agenda, including laws to prevent gun violence and discourage smoking. They're missing the bigger picture. Over more than a decade in office Mr. Bloomberg governed with (and articulated) sensible alternatives on reforming taxes and government services, as well as revitalizing the economy. He kept New York safe from a terrorist attack for 12 years and stood firm with law enforcement to reduce crime by 32% and make it the safest big city in the nation.A Bloomberg candidacy would make no effort to kowtow to the religious right or labor unions. Mr. Bloomberg would not and has never made deals with special interests. Because he has always been able to finance his campaigns himself, his independence is indisputable.As this politically frenetic February wears on, the primary process will demonstrate to voters how divided and dysfunctional the nation has become. For Americans in the middle, a Mike Bloomberg candidacy will become more compelling by the day.Mr. Schoen served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton and has advised Michael Bloomberg since 2001.Credit: By Douglas E.

Donald Trump Among the Canaries; Trump owns persona. His opponents have to go after him on policy and substance.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764226934?accountid=12768,"The one reliably true thing we are witnessing in this 2016 election season is a bipartisan repudiation of Barack Obama's presidency.When Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire vote for a socialist senator because 79% of them say they are worried about the direction of the economy, the incumbent president's seven years in office takes the fall.When Republican voters make clear that their state of angst and anger is such that they will cast their unhappy lot with Donald Trump, that reflects disgust with Barack Obama's conduct of the American presidency.This isn't raised merely to throw sand on Mr. Obama's last year. It is more serious than that. New Hampshire's voters, all present for the Obama experience, are the canaries in the coal mines of American political life.Just as dying canaries warned coal workers that the shaft was filling with toxic gases, New Hampshire's voters have told the political status quo, to coin a phrase, you are killing us.Donald Trump owns the 35% of the Republican electorate that is hacked off about everything. In nearly every exit-poll category--age, ideology, the economy, terror--Mr. Trump has at least 35% secured.What this means for the other candidates is they cannot possibly compete with Donald Trump on his terms, on display in his victory speech Tuesday, which began contained and ended semi-unhinged.A story from the political past will illustrate. In 1958, when George Wallace, then considered something of a Southern liberal, lost the Alabama governorship to a segregationist candidate, he remarked, ""I will never be out-segged again."" Wallace became the premier angry-man populist of his era, running in four presidential races.No one is going to out-rant Donald Trump about the state of America. Chris Christie got in as the tough-guy candidate. He's gone, unable to compete with the Marvel Comics character Donald Trump created.Ted Cruz especially had better reflect. Mr. Cruz's path to the nomination runs through the Southern states and leans heavily on evocative rhetoric and buzzwords--primarily immigration and attacking Washington and ""them.""But Donald Trump owns all of that, and will so long as four or five candidates are dispersing the other 65% of the GOP vote. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have the money and mutual animosity to go on. Ben Carson won't quit. John Kasich is talking about winning Michigan--in a month.If Mr. Trump's persona is impermeable, the other candidates will have to go after him on substance.Mr. Trump has been floating in an inch-deep pool of policy and shows no inclination to expand his pre-existing knowledge of anything. It will require patience and persistence, but his opponents have no choice but to start challenging the implications of what he says and criticizing it in detail.At the core of the Trump campaign is one policy idea: imposing a 45% tariff on goods imported from China. In his shouted, red-faced victory speech Tuesday, he extended the trade offensive to Japan and Mexico.Some detail: Combining the value of goods we sell to them and they to us, China, Mexico and Japan are the U.S's Nos. 1, 3 and 4 trading partners (Canada is No. 2). They are 35% of the U.S.'s trade activity with the world. The total annual value of what U.S. producers--and of course the workers they employ--sell to those three countries is $415 billion.Wal-Mart has 1.4 million U.S. employees in stores filled with foreign-made consumer goods. With a 45% price increase, many won't be working for long.Mr. Trump says the threat alone of a tariff will cause China to cave. Someone should ask: What happens if they don't cave? Incidentally, unlike Mexico, China has between 200 and 300 nuclear warheads and 2.4 million active-duty forces. Irrelevant?He said Tuesday about drugs: ""We're going to end it at the southern border. It's gonna be over."" How?He said: ""I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created."" How?Another campaign venue Donald Trump owns is the national debates. In New Hampshire, 67% said the debates were important to their decision, suggesting the debates are backing out retail politics. If so, the survivor candidates need a new debate strategy.They will always finish behind Donald Trump if they let the moderators design their performances by making the debate a pinball machine, as ABC did in New Hampshire. The randomness, baiting and irrelevance (immigration, the inevitable debate whipping post is the lowest-rated issue in exit polls) make it hard for voters to shape an impression beyond persona, which Mr. Trump owns.Iowa and New Hampshire revealed there are three GOP voting issues in the primaries: economic anxiety, Islamic terrorism and voters' emotional belief in their candidate. A competitive Trump opponent will find a way to drive those subjects--and ignore the rest--across two hours in 30 to 60-second increments.Donald J. Trump reinvented modern media politics.

Bloomberg May See Opening in New Hampshire Primary Results; Victories by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump could boost former NYC mayor's candidacy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764142778?accountid=12768,"Hundreds of miles from the New Hampshire presidential primary, aides to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg eyed the solid victories Tuesday by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump as potential boosts to a Bloomberg candidacy .The results were just one more sign to Mr. Bloomberg's advisers that he may have an opening as Democrats and Republicans embraced candidates they said were unlikely to resonate with voters in a general election. Mr. Bloomberg is expected to meet with Frank Luntz, the pollster and market researcher, this week, according to a person familiar with the matter.Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who served as a senior adviser to Sen. John McCain during his 2008 campaign, said the field of candidates was weak and that the former mayor could win.""Any combination of them in a general election would open a path for an independent candidate,"" said Schmidt, who isn't advising Mr. Bloomberg. ""There's a big opening in the middle of the electorate, and Bloomberg is on point in that space.""Bloomberg aides say they are looking far more closely at the results of Super Tuesday, on March 1, when more states will vote in the primaries and it will be easier to gauge the strength of Mrs. Clinton and others in the race.Related* Michael Bloomberg Mulling Run for President as Independent* Michael Bloomberg Acknowledges He Is Weighing Presidential BidYet, the biggest hurdle to a Bloomberg presidential bid may not hinge on the shifting fortunes of the other candidates, but on the former mayor's political brand. Mr. Bloomberg is a fiscally conservative technocrat with Wall Street roots, a liberal on many social issues and a gun-control advocate. He identified as a Democrat but first ran for mayor in 2001 as a Republican, and later ran as an independent.""He would have zero chance here,"" said Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, a swing state. Mr. Borges said he believed Mr. Bloomberg's positions on issues like gun control would be insurmountable.Other obstacles loom. Some conservative voters, particularly in the South, have ridiculed him for his positions on guns and for a measure in New York City, later turned aside by a court, to restrict the sale of large, sugary drinks.Mr. Bloomberg would also likely face skepticism among Democrats, both for his stout defense of big corporations and for his record on race and policing. A police tactic he embraced known as ""stop-and-frisk"" was criticized as unfairly targeting minorities and struck down in 2013 by a federal judge.Advisers to Mr. Bloomberg said those handicaps could be overcome. One aide broke down Mr. Bloomberg's appeal to voters this way: a political outsider unbeholden to party machinery; private-sector success running Bloomberg LP, his data and media company; three-term mayor of New York, credited with revitalizing the nation's most populous city and driving down crime.""There is a degree of polarization, division and I daresay lack of focus on the major issues facing the country that is exemplified by the entire primary process to date. Including but not limited to New Hampshire,"" said Douglas E. Schoen, a longtime Bloomberg adviser who has conducted polls for the former mayor.Mr. Bloomberg has other advantages. He is worth more than $30 billion and has signaled he is ready to spend. One of his top political aides, Howard Wolfson, served as communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign. He has a stable of loyal aides ready to jump in.The campaign trail could be an awkward place for Mr. Bloomberg, who frequently grew irritated with the New York City press corps for asking personal questions about his life, including his weekend travels to his vacation homes. He isn't a natural campaigner, though his aides noted he grew increasingly easy on the trail as the years passed.""He was used to business groups, marketing professionals--the political media was a very different kind of thing,"" said Bill Cunningham, a former aide to Mr. Bloomberg.A third-party candidate has never succeeded at winning the presidency, though they have shaped the contests, with Ralph Nader in 2000 being the most recent example. Entering the race late, Mr. Bloomberg would face challenges getting on state ballots and building campaign machinery in every state.James McCann, a professor of political science at Purdue University and an expert on third-party candidacies, said Mr. Bloomberg faced an uphill battle. ""It still is difficult to come in from out of the blue and get the traction you need, even when things are really seemingly divisive and there's a great deal of disenchantment, even when you're a billionaire.""Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.comCredit: By Mara Gay and Josh Dawsey",2/10/16

Mr. Borges said he believed Mr. Bloomberg's positions on issues like gun control would be insurmountable.Other obstacles loom. Some conservative voters, particularly in the South, have criticized him for his positions on guns and for a measure in New York City, later turned aside by a court, to curb the sale of large, sugary drinks.Mr. Bloomberg would also likely face skepticism among Democrats, for his defense of big corporations and his record on race and policing. A police tactic he embraced known as ""stop-and-frisk"" was seen as unfairly targeting minorities and its use by the city was ruled unconstitutional in 2013 by a federal judge.Bloomberg aides said those handicaps could be overcome. One aide broke down Mr. Bloomberg's appeal this way: he is a political outsider unbeholden to party machinery; he has had private-sector success running Bloomberg LP, his data and media company; and he is a three-term mayor credited with revitalizing the nation's most populous city and driving down crime.""There is a degree of polarization, division and I daresay lack of focus on the major issues facing the country that is exemplified by the entire primary process to date. Including but not limited to New Hampshire,"" said Douglas E. Schoen, a longtime Bloomberg adviser who has conducted polls for the ex-mayor recently.Mr. Bloomberg has other potential advantages. He is worth more than $30 billion and has signaled he is ready to spend. One of his top political aides, Howard Wolfson, served as communications director for Mrs. Clinton's 2008 campaign. He has a stable of loyal aides ready to jump in.The campaign trail could be awkward for Mr. Bloomberg, who frequently grew irritated with the New York City press corps for asking personal questions about his life, including his weekend travels to his vacation homes. He isn't a natural campaigner, though his aides said he grew increasingly easy on the trail as the years passed. ""He was used to business groups, marketing professionals--the political media was a very different kind of thing,"" said Bill Cunningham, a former aide.A third-party candidate has never succeeded in winning the presidency, though they have shaped contests, Ralph Nader in 2000 being the most recent example. Entering the race late, Mr. Bloomberg would face challenges getting on ballots and building campaign machinery in each state.James McCann, a political- science professor at Purdue University who studies third-party bids, said Mr. Bloomberg faces an uphill battle. ""It still is difficult to come in from out of the blue and get the traction you need, even when things are really seemingly divisive and there's a great deal of disenchantment, even when you're a billionaire,"" he said.Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.comCredit: By Mara Gay and Josh Dawsey",2/11/16

"The Young and the Economically Clueless; Millennials are flocking to Sanders, and in the GOP they favor Trump. Why are young people voting against their own interests?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766586519?accountid=12768,"Bernie Sanders, the 74-year-old self-described democratic socialist, is surprising even himself with his primary-season success against Hillary Clinton, fueled by a staggering 83% majority of the under-30 vote in New Hampshire and 84% in the Iowa caucuses.As this newspaper reported on Tuesday, voters in the millennial bracket, 18- to 34-year-olds, will for the first time equal the baby-boomer share of the electorate, at 31%. These young voters appear to be falling headlong for the Vermont senator's plaintive narrative of economic ""unfairness."" His throwaway prescriptions for redistributing income and wealth are being echoed by an increasingly nervous Mrs. Clinton--despite such policies' having been jettisoned during her husband's administration in the 1990s.Then again, Republican front-runner Donald Trump's vague promises that he will ""make America great again"" aren't much more comforting--except to the masses of Americans responding to his populist diatribes against free trade and immigrants. He too scored well with the young in New Hampshire, though, winning 38% of the 18-29 support, more than double his closest competitor for that group, Ted Cruz, at 17%.These young voters seem not to realize that the economic policies they find so resonant are the least likely to promote the growth and the social mobility they desire. They deserve to be lead from the discredited backwater of equalizing outcomes, forward with policies that instead help eliminate barriers frustrating their access to opportunities.The millennials can't be faulted for being anxious about their economic prospects. They are coming of age in the weakest economy in generations. The underemployment rate (measuring those working a job for which they're overqualified and underpaid) for young adults below age 30 is 60%. The overall employment-to-population ratio of 77.4% for those in the prime-of-working-life 25-54 age bracket translates into 1.5 million jobs below the 20-year average.The college graduate living in his parents' basement and working a marginal job to service a student loan is by now an archetype of the Obama era. And while the headline unemployment numbers are down, and the administration congratulates itself on a tepid ""recovery"" that was almost exclusively dependent on Fed-engineered financial-asset inflation, there is every reason to be skeptical about the health of the labor market. The labor-participation rate languishes at its lowest level in 40 years, and credit creation, government and private investment aren't faring much better.Both Democrats and some Republicans keep blaming it all on ""Wall Street"" (Bernie Sanders's all-purpose boogeyman) for ""getting away with murder"" (Donald Trump on hedge funds). Don't they realize that the financial markets are the lubricant of the entire economy--that Wall Street's capacity to provide liquidity and to broker capital is the lifeblood of American companies? History will probably judge the misguided post-crisis regulations like Dodd-Frank and retribution against Wall Street to have sown the seeds of the next financial crisis. For now, the vilification of Wall Street in the presidential campaign is irresponsible.The sluggish growth of jobs and the economy has a lot more to do with the transitioning from American manufacturing and services to information technology than with the 2008 financial crisis and its supposed perpetrators. And the Fed alone can't do much more to promote its employment-and-inflation mandates.Why? Because the economy is facing complex structural headwinds for both: Artificial intelligence and self-learning algorithms are efficiency-creating and cost-reducing, and soon they will be displacing service professionals and Ph.Ds just as they have factory workers. The Bank of England projects that 45% of jobs done by people in the U.K. will eventually be performed by robots. ArkInvest expects the U.S. to shed 75 million jobs in the next two decades.And yes, the new tech-economy wealth is increasingly concentrating in the hands of relatively few innovators and financiers, leaving the middle class and its consumer demand lagging behind. What is the appropriate role of government in redressing this?Why wouldn't young voters want ""free stuff"" paid for by the rich, as the Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton narrative promises? Because the no-free-lunch axiom is still true: Mr. Sanders's socialized education, health care and other policies would cost up to $20 trillion, according to analysts, requiring tax collections to increase up to 47%. And have we not at least learned from the collapse and dismantling of socialism over the past quarter century that governments lack the incentives and resources to effectively allocate and manage capital in the microeconomy? The eldest of the millennials were in elementary school when the Soviet Union collapsed, so they might be forgiven for their unfamiliarity with the failure of socialist economics. But Bernie Sanders was the mayor of Burlington, Vt., and Hillary Clinton the first lady of Arkansas--what's their excuse for revanchist economics?The economic culture of the U.S. is different than that of any country in the world. Americans have always admired each other's economic success and striven for the chance to achieve it for themselves--by building, not taking the wealth from their neighbors' pockets. Donald Trump is unabashedly proud of his success--no wonder he's so popular. As a political leader, though, he needs to up his economic game quickly from ""There's going to be a bubble popping"" and ""Nobody can solve it like me.""Real solutions demand real leadership, not polarizing Twitter-length rhetoric. An America-appropriate policy response to the inequality challenge needs to be focused on equalizing opportunities, not outcomes. At the very least, removing barriers to social mobility will require tax, regulatory and educational reforms to give people the qualifications and liberty to improve their lives in the new economy.At this point in the presidential campaign, all the ideas for stimulating growth are coming from the Republican side: Marco Rubio has discussed the transformational challenges of the tech economy, and he has proposed alternatives to traditional campus-based higher education (online college and flexible vocational training); innovative student-loan programs; and corporate tax and regulatory reforms. Jeb Bush and John Kasich are also reform-minded, including promoting initiatives to ease the burden on small businesses that power job growth.Yet millennials, who would most benefit from a real economic recovery, replacing the false one of the past several years, so far seem intent on voting against their interests. There is still hope. We're moving past the peak of the ""authenticity"" phase of the campaign cycle, when voters unfamiliar with the field of candidates are initially drawn simply to candidates who seem willing to bluntly speak their minds. John Kasich's strong performance in New Hampshire might herald the transition to a more constructive phase, when voters--including millennials--are readier to listen to a more nuanced, realistic economic message. If not, today's young voters may not like the world they inherit, and members of the aging generation risk eventually finding themselves short of the Social Security benefits they thought they had coming.Mr. Arbess, the founder of Xerion Investments, is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and co-founder of No Labels, promoting political bipartisanship.Credit: By Daniel J.

"Trump and Political Circuses Are Nothing New; Roman politicians whipped up crowds, warned about 'outsiders' and insulted their rivals.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768057860?accountid=12768,"Ancient Romans would find the drama of American primary elections eerily familiar. Like us, the Romans treated politics as theater, attending speeches and rallies where political figures worked the crowd. They held popular elections and supported charismatic leaders who thrived on celebrity.When Cicero ran for consul around 63 B.C., his brother Quintus wrote a fascinating manual of political advice. Quintus urged Cicero to be available night and day to citizens who needed his services, to look alert and interested when voters spoke, and to make them believe he cared. It was the beginning of a romance, when followers come to believe that what leaders do, they do for them.But before aspiring officeholders can be seen as worthy of public affection, they first must be seen. Reality-TV star Donald Trump is a modern-day master at capturing public notice, but he is no trailblazer. Those seeking power have always found ways to achieve celebrity.Romans vying for office bleached their togas a brilliant white, making them stand out. Candidates also surrounded themselves with throngs of supporters to attract maximum attention. The ""social media"" campaigns of Julius Caesar and Augustus featured flattering portraits displayed in public places. After being elected, they stamped their profiles on coins to further enhance their celebrity.Star power fueled narcissism then as it does now. Julius Caesar was a deft schmoozer, adept at working the crowd. Affable and adored by soldiers, he was the kind of guy you could drink the famed Falernian wine with. But his narcissism undermined him. Caesar became hated for his arrogance, and dozens of Roman senators joined the conspiracy to assassinate him.Winning political arguments has always required style, not just substance. And nobody in the age of the Republic was better at style than Cato the Censor. As the Senate debated around 149 B.C. what action to take against its old foe Carthage, Cato produced a cluster of grapes from the folds of his toga. He declared, no doubt falsely, that they had been picked in Carthage the same day. His dramatic performance worked. Though Carthage hadn't posed a serious threat for over half a century, Cato energized his compatriots' fears of its resurgence, silenced critics and shaped a docile following. Rome declared war and finally destroyed Carthage in 146 B.C.Charismatic leaders are good actors. Whether facing constituents, competitors or enemies, they present themselves as dominant and fit. When Gaius Popilius Laenas first encountered the Seleucid King Antiochus IV in 168 B.C., he used a stick to draw a circle in the sand around the king. He ordered him not to cross it until he agreed to do Rome's bidding. Intimidated by the brazen act, the king acquiesced.Roman leaders knew that anger stunts contemplation. Opponents excoriated one another with vitriolic insults. Cicero accused Mark Antony of having been a male prostitute in his youth and of frequenting brothels later in life. Such slurs, difficult to disprove, distracted attention from Antony's achievements and Cicero's flaws.Shared feelings and actions have always been used by charismatic leaders to bring people together in common cause. At Julius Caesar's funeral Mark Antony whipped mourners into a collective frenzy by revealing the dead man's lacerated body. Today the synchronous chants of ""Bernie!"" and ""Hillary!"" or the contagious booing and applauding at the Republican debates help transform individuals into easy-to-lead collectives.Overstating the threat posed by ""outsiders"" also reinforces the common identity of the ""insiders."" Octavian, the future Emperor Augustus, suggested around 33 B.C. that his rival, Mark Antony, had become the plaything of the enemy's most famous seductress, Queen Cleopatra of Egypt. Octavian warned that if Antony came to power, then a foreigner would become Rome's queen. Now Mr. Trump professes concern that the Canadian-born Ted Cruz could become president.As the politically savvy Quintus understood, voters are romanced more by appearance than reality. Roman leaders knew that politics is theater, and much depends on the power of the script and the stardom and charisma of the performer. In this sense, political figures through the ages are cut from the same bleached cloth.Mr. Garland is a classics professor, and Ms. Keating a psychology professor, at Colgate University.Credit: By Robert S.J.

"Trump Is Killing Cruz; Ted Cruz had a plausible election strategy, until Donald Trump stole it.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767790436?accountid=12768,"Ted Cruz has to be wondering: What happened?In the wake of his third-place finish in Nevada, Mr. Cruz's case for himself is: Don't forget Iowa. He has come a long way.In the fall of 2013, the freshman Texas senator rolled the dice so boldly that the biggest congressional Texan of all time, Lyndon Johnson, would have been agog. Sen. Cruz, with the whole Republican Party raging at him, pulled off a shutdown of the U.S. government. He publicized the shutdown with a 21-hour speech on the Senate floor, attacking other Republicans for not joining his Pickett's charge against ObamaCare, then a federal law.Ted Cruz knew amid this GOP chaos that he was going to run for president in 2016. He had the game plan in hand.The plan was to make a household name for himself as the Republican Party's best-known outsider. A narrative back then held that a deep wave of anger at the party's leadership was building in the heartland. Ted Cruz was going to personally deepen the anger and then ride it.It would surface with a victory in Iowa, which he got, build in South Carolina, and then surge through Super Tuesday and especially Texas with an unstoppable number of Cruz delegates fished from this angry Republican sea of outsiders--tea partiers, anti-immigrant voters, pro-Snowden libertarians, evangelicals and anyone foaming mad at Barack Obama. The mad-as-hell vote.It was a plausible primary strategy, elegant even in its mathematical inevitability, despite the crushed-glass content.Until Donald Trump stole the whole thing.Sen. Cruz, the self-designed outsider, is getting killed by the outsider from hell.Somewhere in the South on Super Tuesday Sen. Cruz may yet get back on track a plan that was going to let him thumb his nose at a resentful Republican Senate from behind that big desk in the Oval Office. More likely, Ted Cruz is about to join Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, Scott Walker and Chris Christie as a Trump trophy.But this one is different. If Ted Cruz falls, he'll take a lot of the activist right with him.This was never a one-man show. The Cruz strategy was supported by an array of political factions whose goal was to make the Cruz candidacy a vehicle for seizing operational control of the Republican Party.Those groups included political fundraising operations such as Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund, a variety of Web-based political entrepreneurs and white-hot radio.Because the goal was seizing political power, the pitch to audiences wasn't complicated. It was Us versus Them. We are ""real conservatives,"" and ""they"" are not. They are ""the Establishment,"" a term made up from nothing.The distinctions were also simple.Immigration: We are for ""controlling the borders."" They are for ""amnesty.""Trade: They are for trade promotion authority. Real conservatives are against TPA.Both are serious issues, but policy details were an impediment to the takeover.It was a kind of bitter fun while it lasted. It lasted until Donald Trump's June 2015 presidential announcement in which he said: I'm just gonna grab all of that stuff . . . and make it simpler.The Mexican-built wall, the Muslim ban, the trade war with China, whatever. By the time we all got to South Carolina, Donald Trump had transformed Ted Cruz and the ""real conservative"" insurrection into . . . the Establishment.He is killing them. He is reaping the politics they worked to sow--on immigration, on trade and on inchoate anger.Exit polls show Sen. Cruz winning a plurality of the ""very conservative"" vote. But there aren't enough ""very conservative"" voters to win anything now because Donald Trump is siphoning 33% of everything else.The Cruz camp might argue that it has as much chance as Marco Rubio in a one-on-one contest against the Trump 33%. It's far from clear, though, that the Rubio-Bush-Kasich vote would default to Sen. Cruz. The Cruz media-support operation for years has ridiculed vast swaths of the Republican Party, including lifelong Reagan conservatives, as the abhorrent ""mainstream"" or the ""donor class.""The goal was to separate them from Ted Cruz. It worked.Also in pieces is the Cruz faction's takeover of the Republican Party, what's left of it. Conventional wisdom holds that the Trump insurgency is a hostile takeover of the GOP. It is not that.Donald Trump is properly understood as running an independent candidacy from inside the formal structure of the Republican Party, as Mike Bloomberg did to run for mayor of New York City. Nothing remotely resembling a political party is associated with Mr. Trump. If he loses the nomination or the general election, he will walk away from his Republican supporters by dawn. The GOP will look like a forest shredded by a tornado.Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich have to decide if the time has come to let Donald Trump define the Republican Party, or let the rest of the Republicans choose either him or someone else as the majority's choice for their nominee.Sen. Cruz already offered a defined choice for the Republican Party. Donald Trump owns that version. It's a little late for Mr. Cruz's Plan B.Write to henninger@wsj.comCredit: By Daniel Henninger",3/2/16
Donald Trump Rebukes Pope Francis for Questioning His Christianity; Republican candidate said it was 'disgraceful' his faith was being question over immigration stands,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766035226?accountid=12768,"KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C.--An extraordinary verbal dispute broke out between Pope Francis and Donald Trump after the pontiff criticized Mr. Trump as ""not Christian"" for his anti-immigrant stands and the presidential candidate responded that it was ""disgraceful"" that his personal faith was being questioned.Related* Pope Says Contraception Can Be Acceptable in Zika-Hit AreasThe spat started when the pope, an outspoken supporter of immigrants' rights, bluntly criticized Mr. Trump's positions on the issue, which is at the heart of the debate leading up to the Republican primary in South Carolina Saturday. Referring to Mr. Trump's proposal to build a wall to keep out illegal immigrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, the pontiff said: ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.""The pope spoke as he flew home to Rome after a visit to Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, during which he stood at the U.S.-Mexico border and issued a plea for justice for undocumented migrants.In response, Mr. Trump suggested the pope had been manipulated by the Mexican government. ""For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful,"" Mr. Trump said, drawing cheers from a crowd of about 500 people in this upscale coastal community.The bitter words came just two days ahead of the South Carolina Republican primary on Saturday. Mr. Trump has led opinion polls in the state, but one rival, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, picked up a key endorsement from Gov. Nikki Haley on Wednesday and another top foe, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is also running strong.It isn't clear what effect, if any, the dispute might have on the South Carolina vote. Immigration policies have been the subject of some of the most heated rhetoric of the primary fight here, with Messrs. Trump, Cruz and Rubio all weighing in on the subject. Mr. Trump's strong stand against illegal immigrants, including his controversial call for building a wall to keep out Hispanic immigrants from the south, has been perhaps the most prominent feature of his presidential effort.Mr. Trump's opponents tried to steer clear of the controversy on the campaign trail on Thursday.""Listen, that's between Donald and the pope. I'm not going to get in the middle of that,"" Mr. Cruz said, declining to take questions about the pope's position on a border wall.Mr. Rubio said Thursday the U.S. has the right to control who comes into the U.S. and when and how people do that.""There's a balance here between being compassionate and also being responsible, especially in a world where, today, radical jihadists are seeking to use the immigration laws of countries to infiltrate killers and fighters into foreign countries,"" Mr. Rubio said on CNN.Mr. Rubio also addressed Mr. Trump's intention to build a wall at the Mexican border, saying ""the wall is not just about immigrants, it's also about potentially terrorists crossing that border, not to mention the drugs that are coming across that border. And the human trafficking that's occurring because people know they can get people across the border.""Mr. Trump is no stranger to controversial comments, which often serve to bolster his reputation with supporters as a politically incorrect truth teller. But his escalating fight with the pope raises new stakes.In South Carolina, the key GOP voting bloc is not Catholics but evangelicals, with about 65% of Republican voters identifying as born-again or evangelical in 2012 exit polls. This election cycle, Mr. Trump won the majority of evangelicals in New Hampshire and Mr. Cruz won them in Iowa.Statewide, about 35% of adults in South Carolina identify as evangelicals, and 10% identify as Catholic, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center study. Across the U.S., more than 80 million people identify as Catholic, or about one-quarter of the population.In his comments Thursday, Mr. Trump, who has faced questions about the depth of his religious beliefs, told the crowd that he is a Christian ""and proud of it."" He suggested that the pope, who he has previously called ""political,"" was unduly influenced by the Mexican government and saw only ""one side"" of the story.""He said negative things about me because the Mexican government convinced him that Trump is not a good guy,"" Mr. Trump said.A spokesman for Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto said Mr. Trump's proposal for a border wall was not a subject that came up in talks between the pontiff and Mr. Pea Nieto.Mr. Trump, a Presbyterian, also re-aired a dire prediction he had made last year: that the Vatican is a top target for Islamic State terrorists, and he would be the best commander in chief to keep it safe.""If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would've only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would've been president,"" he said Thursday.Mr. Trump has promised he will build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border if he is elected president and force Mexico to pay for it. While Mr. Trump has been the most outspoken about building a wall, all of the Republican candidates see securing the border more tightly as the first step in any overhaul of U.S. immigration policy.Mr. Trump has drawn particular ire from critics over his call for deporting millions of immigrants in the country illegally, and his labelling of Mexican immigrants as drug traffickers and rapists.In interviews after the rally, about a dozen Trump supporters said the businessman's forceful rebuke bolstered their support for him.Joanna Horres, a homemaker from Charleston, S.C., who led the crowd in pro-Trump chants as Mr. Trump ran about an hour late, said she has backed him since he declared he would run for president.""It makes my opinion of him even stronger,"" she said. ""He's not afraid to speak up to anybody, even the pope. He's obviously a Christian who is secure in his salvation, he doesn't need the approval of the pope either.""Larry DiCenzo, a retired school principal who also lives in Charleston, said he was shocked the pope would criticize Mr. Trump's religion. Mr. DiCenzo, a Catholic, said the feud wouldn't change the way he voted on Saturday.""I liked Trump's response, it was to the point, which is the reason why I like Trump because he says it as it is and he is truthful,"" Mr. DiCenzo said. ""It astounds me that [the Pope] would say that and I disagree with him.""Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., a Trump supporter, told CNN on Thursday that the pope's comments went too far.""Jesus never intended to give instructions to political leaders on how to run a country,"" Mr. Falwell said.The pope has been a staunch defender of immigrants during his papacy. He made his first visit outside the Vatican as pope in 2013 to Lampedusa, the Italian island that has been the destination for hundreds of thousands of African and Middle Eastern migrants arriving from Libya.He has called for Europe--currently battered by a deeply divisive debate over how to manage the spiraling migrant crisis--to open its doors to the people. That stance has earned him some criticism from anti-immigrant politicians in Italy, as well as a few church leaders elsewhere in Europe.Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, an immigrant from Mexico who has publicly pushed for changes to U.S. immigration law, said Thursday that the pope doesn't see immigration as a political issue.""It's about people, not economics or politics,"" Mr. Gomez said while waiting for his flight back to Los Angeles in the El Paso airport. He had attended Mass the day before in Juarez. ""What the pope is saying is it's a global issue, let's find a solution.""He declined to comment specifically on the pope's words or Mr. Trump's reaction because he hadn't read the full transcript of the pope's remarks, but said ""if you follow the Bible you have to be open to people migrating. The Bible says clearly you have to welcome the stranger."" Though, he added, ""security at the border is still important.""Some Mexicans said they were grateful the pope spoke out. ""Is there a more hated person in the world right now than Donald Trump?"" asked Oscar Tello, a 31-year-old tennis coach in Mexico City. ""I'm glad the pope pointed out that Mr. Trump is not acting like a Christian.""Mari Rojas, a 37-year-old who sells tacos on the street, said the dislike for Mr. Trump is not entirely about his proposal to build a wall between both nations--or even to have Mexico pay for it. ""It was the way he described Mexicans as rapists and criminals. He is not a good man, and our pope is just saying that Jesus would not approve,"" she said.Patrick O'Connor, Tamara Audi and David Luhnow contributed to this article.Credit: By Francis X.

Pope Francis Says Contraception Can Be Acceptable in Regions Hit by Zika Virus; Pontiff also criticized Donald Trump and suggested Catholic legislators could vote for same-sex unions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766006228?accountid=12768,"ROME--Pope Francis said the use of contraception could be justified in regions hit by the Zika virus, a stance that could reignite a debate over the church's prohibition of the use of condoms to stop the spread of the AIDS virus.The pope also criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as ""not Christian "" for his immigration stance, and broke with his predecessors by suggesting that Catholic lawmakers are free to vote for same-sex marriage and civil unions.Related* Pope Calls Trump 'Not Christian' on ImmigrationThe pope spoke during an overnight flight Wednesday back to Rome following an intense, six-day trip to Cuba and Mexico that saw him hold a historic meeting with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, blast corruption and exploitation of the poor and defend the plight of immigrants.The pope's comments on the use of contraception in Zika-afflicted areas comes amid proposals that women in regions hit by the virus--largely in Latin America--use abortion or avoid getting pregnant to prevent the birth of children with microcephaly.Bishops in Latin America have said the Zika virus doesn't justify the use of abortion or contraception.However, responding to a question, the pope distinguished between abortion, which he said was never acceptable, and contraception, which he said could be justified as the lesser evil in certain circumstances.He recalled that Pope Paul VI, author the 1968 encyclical ""Humanae Vitae"" which affirmed the immorality of contraception, permitted its use by nuns in the former Belgian Congo because rape was being used as a weapon during fighting there in the 1960s.Pope Francis said the spread of Zika was another exceptional circumstance that could justify the use of contraception.""Avoiding pregnancy isn't an absolute evil, and in certain cases such as this one, as in that one I mentioned of Blessed Paul VI, it was clear,"" the pope said.His words could encourage those calling for the church's approval of using condoms to fight the spread of HIV, the subject of a long-running and acrimonious debate that Pope Francis hasn't pronounced on.During his news conference, Pope Francis also addressed another sensitive topic: gay marriage.A 2003 document from the Vatican's doctrinal office, under then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, categorically forbade Catholic legislators from voting for same-sex marriage or unions.But Pope Francis said a Catholic legislator is free to vote on such matters in accordance with the dictates of a ""well-formed conscience,"" which he said wasn't the same as merely subjective opinion.The Catholic Church regards homosexual acts as sinful, but Pope Francis has advocated a more open approach to gays, even as he reiterated the church's opposition to same-sex marriage.The pope addressed the problem of sexual abuse of children by priests, calling it a ""monstrosity"" and condemning cover-ups by bishops of abuse by their priests.""A bishop who moves a priest to another parish when a case of pedophilia is discovered is an irresponsible man, and the best thing he can do is to present his resignation,"" the pope said.Pope Francis last year accepted the resignations of two U.S. bishops, in Missouri and Minnesota, for mishandling cases of sex abuse by priests under their authority. But victims' advocates have criticized the pope for appointing a Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse he witnessed years earlier.The pope praised his predecessor St. John Paul II, whose long and intense friendship with a Polish philosopher, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, was the subject of fascination in recent days as the result of a television documentary.""A man who doesn't know how to have a relationship of friendship with a woman is a man who is missing something,"" Pope Francis said.Stressing that any ""romantic relationship"" outside marriage is sinful according to the church, the pope said he often sought women out for advice on important matters.""They look at things in a different way,"" he said. ""Women form life in their wombs, so they have the gift of being able to give you things you can build with.""Diving into the charged debate over immigration in the U.S., Pope Francis blasted Mr. Trump's campaign promises to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel,"" the pope said. ""This man is not Christian if he talks that way.""Mr. Trump dismissed the criticism and said it was ""disgraceful"" for the pope to question his faith.Write to Francis X.

"President Obama Created Donald Trump; After the cool, weak and endlessly nuanced Obama, no wonder voters are going for a strong, blunt leader.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770091386?accountid=12768,"President Obama doesn't get enough credit for his accomplishments. I know this because he often tells us it is so. I happen to agree that he doesn't get enough credit. No, not for slowing the rise of the oceans or healing the planet, as he immodestly claimed he would, even before taking office. He has succeeded handsomely, though, in living up to his vow to be a transformative president, like Ronald Reagan, and not an incremental one in the Bill Clinton mold. Mr. Obama has accomplished many changes--they just aren't the ones we were waiting for.Mr. Obama has alienated allies like Israel while encouraging adversaries like Iran and Cuba. He has fostered Americans' record-breaking dependence on government programs and record-low participation in the workforce. He has expanded the power, size and expense of the federal government in unprecedented ways, all at the expense of Americans' freedom, standard of living and economic well-being.But the president truly doesn't get enough credit for creating one of the most polarizing forces in American politics today. No, not Hillary--that is more Bill's doing. Let's be honest: There would be no Donald Trump, dominating the political scene today if it were not for President Obama.I believe that voters tend to act in open-seat presidential elections to correct for the perceived deficiencies of the incumbent. In 1980, after four years of President Carter's telling us to turn up the thermostat and wear a cardigan, while the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and the Iranians invaded the U.S. Embassy, the fed-up American people elected a cowboy to the White House who made it clear that the evil empire's days were numbered.After eight years of President Reagan's supply-side economics and broadsides against welfare queens, we got a kinder, gentler President H.W. Bush. After four years of international diplomacy without the ""vision thing,"" we got a loquacious Arkansas governor promising to invent a third way forward focused on the economy at home. After eight years of Clintonian empathy and skirt-chasing, we got a plain-spoken President George W. Bush, who promised to restore integrity to the Oval Office. After Hurricane Katrina and post-Hussein Iraq, we got the professorial President Barack Obama, who seemed to many to promise competence.After seven years of the cool, weak and endlessly nuanced ""no drama Obama,"" voters are looking for a strong leader who speaks in short, declarative sentences. Middle-class incomes are stagnant, and radical Islam is on the march across the Middle East. No wonder voters are responding to someone who promises to make America great again. You can draw a straight line between a president who dismisses domestic terrorist attacks as incidents of workplace violence and a candidate who wants to ban Muslims from entering the country.Mr. Obama likes to bemoan the increasing partisan divides across the country, as if he were merely a passive observer at best and a victim at worst. Uncharacteristically, the president is being too modest. He has created the very rancor he now rails against. Imagine how different things would be if Mr. Obama had pursued a stimulus bill that included targeted tax cuts and infrastructure spending balanced with gradual entitlement reforms--instead of a stimulus that merely dusted off congressional Democrats' wish list of pork-barrel projects and ideological experiments.Imagine if Mr. Obama had actually worked with Republicans in an open process to bring down health-care costs--instead of pushing through, on a partisan vote, the largest expansion of government-welfare programs in a generation. Or if he had listened to the message that voters sent in the first midterm election by putting Republicans in charge of Congress--instead of petulantly relying on executive orders, and using an eraser and whiteout on the Constitution, to shove the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies deeper into Americans' lives.Over the past seven years America could have been transformed in an inspiring way if its education system had been opened up, if its energy policy had been liberated, if the entire approach to governing had been overhauled. President Obama chose the opposite approach, favoring a closed education system that fails millions of children and an energy policy that chains the economy to his green agenda.President Obama loves to construct straw men so he can contrast his heroic self against them. But Donald Trump needs no characterization; he is capable of being absurd on his own, no outside help required. Without President Obama, there is no Donald Trump. Mr. Trump often diagnoses the ills Mr. Obama has caused, but his prescriptions are just as often wrong. America deserves better.Mr. Jindal is the former governor of Louisiana.Credit: By Bobby Jindal",3/7/16
Front-Runners' Wins in Virginia on Super Tuesday Point a Way Forward; Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton show they can forge needed voter coalitions in diverse swing state,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769071445?accountid=12768,"Of all their primary victories Tuesday, the wins by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Virginia did the most to show they can forge the voter coalitions needed to win their party's presidential nominations.Racially diverse, with big, urban centers and a large share of college graduates, Virginia stood as a proving ground for candidates in both parties as the nomination races move in coming weeks to other large, diverse states, including Ohio and Florida.The parties' two front-runners won the state in different ways: Mrs. Clinton expanded the coalition she had built in earlier contests; Mr. Trump, while showing growing support among some voter groups, won in large part due to greater intensity among voter groups who were already part of his natural base.Coming in the largest presidential swing state to vote so far, the two paths to victory give clues to the coalitions each candidate might try to form as a party nominee.Mr. Trump has built a dominating position in the presidential race by carrying lower-income voters and those without a four-year college degree. In Virginia, he won those groups with larger margins than he had in prior contests, preliminary exit poll results reported by various media show.Mr. Trump carried a remarkable 52% of voters with household income under $50,000, a far larger share than in his victories in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. He won 44% of voters without a college degree--a larger share than in three of the four contests before Super Tuesday. Those voter groups remain the pillars of his candidacy.At the same time, Mr. Trump was able to deprive Sen. Marco Rubio, his top rival in the state, of big margins among his own natural base, including college graduates and voters with the highest incomes. Mr. Rubio won those groups--but not by the vote totals needed to overcome the bounding support Mr. Trump enjoyed among his own core groups. With almost all precincts reporting, Mr. Trump edged Mr. Rubio in the state, 35% to 32%.Mr. Trump's coalition took on different contours that suggest growing acceptance by some parts of the party and hesitancy among others after weeks of a coarsening nomination battle. Mr. Trump's share of self-described moderate voters in Virginia was lower by far than in any prior contest. He carried only 23% of that group, exit polls reported by media showed, compared to about one-third of voters in three prior contests and 55% in the Nevada caucuses.At the same time, he won a larger share of evangelical Christians than in any prior contest but one.Mrs. Clinton, in contrast to Mr. Trump, expanded the coalition she had built in prior contests.She carried 58% of white voters, preliminary exit poll results showed, compared to 54% in last weekend's South Carolina primary. Mrs. Clinton had lost white voters to Sen. Bernie Sanders in the course of winning the Nevada caucuses. With almost all precincts reporting, Mrs. Clinton won Virginia with 64% to Mr. Sanders's 35%.At the same time, Mrs. Clinton reduced Mr. Sanders's margins among younger voters, and he carried only 52% of voters younger than age 45, exit polls showed. That was a far smaller share than the 74% Mr. Sanders won during his landslide victory last month in New Hampshire.Mr. Sanders won only 36% of voters without a four-year college degree, a group he had carried in some prior contests.Mr. Trump's working-class coalition held together in many other states. In Arkansas, he won Republican voters with household income under $50,000 while losing higher-income voters to Sen. Ted Cruz. Similarly, he won Arkansas Republicans who don't have a college degree, while losing college graduates to Messrs. Cruz and Rubio.Mr. Trump also lost among Republicans with a college degree in Vermont, while winning those without a degree.Voters who went to the polls Tuesday also reflected the nation's widening partisan divide: Republicans in many states leaned more conservative than in their last competitive primaries, while Democrats were more liberal.In Tennessee, for example, 83% of GOP voters rated themselves as conservative, compared with 73% who said so in 2012.By contrast, the Democratic voter pool in Virginia was more liberal than during the party's last contested primary, in 2008. Some 68% of Virginia Democrats who voted on Tuesday called themselves liberal, the preliminary exit poll results showed, compared with 50% in 2008. The share of self-described moderates fell nine percentage points to 29%.Write to Dante Chinni at Dante.Chinni@wsj.comCredit: By Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni",3/7/16
The Trump-Obama Corporate Tax Reform Fail; They both want a minimum tax on the foreign earnings of U.S. companies. That's no 'inversion' cure.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770794277?accountid=12768,"Removing the incentive for American companies to move their headquarters abroad is a widely recognized goal. To do so, the U.S. will need to join the rest of the G-7 countries and tax business income only once, in the country where it was earned. Notably, this principle--called territoriality--is included in the bipartisan framework for international tax reform developed by Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) in 2015.Unfortunately, recent reform proposals have a serious flaw: a ""minimum tax"" on foreign business income. This flaw is in President Obama's fiscal 2017 budget, and Republican presidential front-runner, Donald Trump, has broached a similar idea on the campaign trail.Currently, the U.S. taxes the world-wide income of its corporations at one of the highest rates in the world, but defers that tax until the profits are repatriated. The result is the worst of all worlds--a high federal statutory rate (35%) that encourages aggressive transfer pricing, a significant restriction on capital allocation that keeps cash offshore, very little revenue for the Treasury, and the loss of U.S. headquarters to countries with territorial tax systems.Major financing and investment patterns now reflect these distortions. A series of significant merger announcements are driven by the desire to get out from under the U.S. tax regime and to use offshore cash. The large debt offerings in our capital markets are efforts by companies to fund share repurchases and dividends because repatriation of their offshore cash would trigger punitive U.S. taxes.Tax reform is supposed to end these distortions, but a global minimum tax on foreign business earnings would undermine reform. The Obama administration's budget, for example, would end the deferral of taxes on unrepatriated cash and lower the statutory tax rate on corporate income to 28% (still higher than most other industrial nations). A U.S. company would still be able, as it can today, to take a credit on the taxes it already paid to another country. But if the taxes a U.S. company paid to another country were less than 19%, it would be slapped with an additional federal tax. The minimum-tax is dressed up by rhetoric that it will protect jobs at home and ensure that companies pay a ""fair share.""Mr. Trump has recommended a world-wide system without deferral and a much lower rate of 15%. As such, American firms earning profits abroad would still face home-country taxation and the Byzantine system of foreign tax credits that creates numerous tax planning opportunities.The flaw in both proposals? Corporate tax rates are declining around the world, amid continuing competition for firm headquarters and intellectual property. Ireland taxes most corporate profits at 12.5%. A global minimum tax means U.S. companies earning income abroad would still be subject to adverse U.S. taxes--precisely the distortion that tax reform is supposed to end. Meanwhile, the disincentives to be a U.S.-headquartered multinational firm will persist.Japan in 2009 and the United Kingdom in 2010 shifted to a territorial tax regime and lowered their statutory corporate rates. The U.K. did so to stop companies from moving their headquarters abroad; Japan was primarily interested in encouraging its multinationals to reinvest foreign earnings at home. Neither country adopted a minimum tax when it switched to territoriality. And neither country experienced the predicted dire consequences--such as dramatic tax revenue losses or job losses from outbound investment--of a switch to territoriality without a minimum tax.In fact, no significant country with a territorial tax regime has a minimum tax on its companies' foreign earnings. In part, this decision reflects the considerable complexity that such a minimum tax would create, a complexity that will only serve the industry of tax planners.Ultimately, the proposal for a minimum tax is driven by unfounded fears that American multinational firms pose a risk to the American worker by not showing loyalty to America. This coarse intuition is both naive and wrong. It is naive to assume that U.S. policy makers can exert market power to limit the logic of global opportunities and imperatives. More important, it is mistaken to demonize the foreign operations of American multinationals as working contrary to the interests of American workers.Instead the evidence, including research by C. Fritz Foley, James R. Hines and myself, suggests that U.S. companies succeeding globally expand at home--contradicting the zero-sum intuition. Demonizing multinational firms plays to populist impulses today. But ensuring that the U.S. is a great home for global companies and a great place for them to invest is actually the best prescription for rising median wages.Opportunities for corporate tax reform are infrequent. Including a global minimum tax would therefore be something the U.S. would have to live with for decades--during which corporate tax rates will fall around the world and the minimum tax, as well as its distortions, would grow in importance.Mr. Desai is a professor of finance at Harvard Business School and a professor of law at Harvard Law School.Credit: By Mihir A.

Democrats Settle in for Long Presidential Contest; Clinton's delegate lead grows even as Sanders wins Michigan; Trump aims for quick end to Republican race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771628860?accountid=12768,"MIAMI--Sen. Bernie Sanders's upset win in Michigan this week left Democrats bracing for a long and costly primary fight and another round of split decisions in five contests next week.The first post-Michigan showdown between front-runner Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders came at the eighth Democratic debate here Wednesday evening, aimed at a Latino audience, where they challenged each other's records on immigration, education and jobs.Mrs. Clinton had to defend the government's handling of the 2014 influx of Central American children at the southern border, while Mr. Sanders was under fire for his opposition to a 2007 bill to rewrite immigration laws.While Florida is friendlier territory for Mrs. Clinton, the Vermont senator hopes to build on his narrow victory in Michigan, riding his populist economic and trade themes into neighboring industrial states Ohio and Illinois, which hold primaries Tuesday.Still, while Mr. Sanders has both money and momentum, Hillary Clinton has math on her side. The former secretary of state extended her commanding delegate lead Tuesday after minimizing her Michigan loss while trouncing her Democratic rival in Mississippi. She now has 1,221 delegates, more than half the number needed to secure the nomination; Mr. Sanders has 571.As Democrats settle in for a long haul reminiscent of the 2008 primary, the Republican contest could be nearing its conclusion if Donald Trump prevails next week in Ohio and Florida, two winner-take-all contests that could give the businessman an insurmountable delegate lead.The prospect of a protracted battle for the Democratic nomination and sooner-than-expected end to the GOP contest underscores the unpredictability of this election cycle. At the start of the year, most political experts were predicting reverse paths to the party's presidential nominations, with Clinton expected to dominate her race while a crowded field of Republicans slugged it out.""It's a big win,"" Tad Devine, a senior strategist for the Sanders campaign, said of the Michigan victory that slowed Mrs. Clinton's momentum. ""It's going to give a lot of people who weren't sure that Bernie could really prevail in this process a lot of hope that he will.""On Tuesday, Democratic primary voters will cast ballots in North Carolina, Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio.Mr. Sanders's aides are taking a realistic approach that aims to maximize his delegate haul in states he has his best chances of winning. That means, for instance, that Florida may be beyond their reach since independents can't participate, said Mr. Devine.Broad support from those unaffiliated voters helped Mr. Sanders win Michigan, while Mrs. Clinton won among registered Democrats. Also, the state allows early voting, meaning many Florida Democrats cast ballots before Mr. Sanders picked up new momentum with victory this week.Illinois and Ohio present better opportunities; both have more flexible rules regarding independent-voter participation in party primaries. In addition, Mr. Sanders's opposition to trade agreements is likely to resonate in those states.Michigan was the first big, industrialized northern state to weigh in on the primary. Its median household income of $49,000 and percentage of people who are 25 and older with a bachelor's degree, 26%, are in line with those in Ohio and Illinois. The states also have deep roots and history in blue-collar manufacturing.Though Mr. Sanders's message proved potent, Clinton advisers said they don't plan a major course change. They will work to highlight Mrs. Clinton's views on trade and her plans to create better-paying jobs.""We're going to have to work even harder to amplify Secretary Clinton's economic argument,"" said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.The bigger concern for the Clinton campaign is the extension of a nomination race that they remain convinced she will ultimately win because of her lead in the delegate count.A long contest costs a lot of money, and she will continue to have to guard against Mr. Sanders's attempts to press her to embrace his more liberal positions, which the Clinton campaign worries would hurt her in the general election.""From the beginning, we have approached this nomination contest as a battle for delegates,"" Mr. Mook said. ""So, while Sen. Sanders has placed big bets on pulling out wins in certain individual states, we have sought to compete everywhere in every state with the goal of amassing the most delegates possible.""Much like the Democratic presidential campaign in 2008, this race now could stretch into the early summer. In that campaign, Mrs. Clinton won 23 contests before eventually conceding to then-Sen. Barack Obama.Bill Burton, a Democratic strategist and former Obama aide, said Mrs. Clinton's Michigan speed bump reminded him of Mrs. Clinton's come-from-behind victory in New Hampshire in 2008 that caught the Obama campaign by surprise.At the time, top Obama advisers remained focused on methodically executing a plan focused on amassing delegates. He said Mrs. Clinton's campaign was wise to do the same this year.Dan Pfeiffer, a senior aide on the Obama 2008 campaign, said there are similarities between the situation Mrs. Clinton finds herself in now and that of Mr. Obama in 2008, but her delegate lead is larger than his was at a similar point in the race.""The math made it virtually impossible for Clinton to catch Obama at this point in '08 and the same is true now. Everything that happens from this point on is interesting, but it is not particularly instructive,"" he said.Democratic strategist Mark Mellman said that, as in 2008, this Democratic race will be close and hard fought, but ""it's not going be as close and it's not going to be as hard fought.""Though the delegate math looks daunting for Mr. Sanders, his campaign advisers say he can close the gap. For one, the superdelegates, who are party officials and elected leaders, now backing Mrs. Clinton may switch allegiances if she loses their states.""If you want to be the nominee of your party you not only have to win early you have to win often,"" Mr. Devine said. ""You cannot go on a losing streak and expect that all the people, especially the superdelegates who've come to you in droves, are going to stay with you in droves.""Dante Chinni contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson, Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",3/11/16
No Wonder Trump Does So Well With the Poor,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772416771?accountid=12768,"Your analysis of voting patterns on Super Tuesday is illuminating (""Voting in Poor, Rich Cities Offers Clues to Race Ahead,"" page one, March 3). Here's another possible reason why Donald Trump dominated in economically challenged cities, while Hillary Clinton's bedrock of support was in relatively high-income areas: Federal regulations disproportionately harm low-income households. Regardless of what benefits regulations may deliver, compliance with them imposes costs on producers. Contrary to popular myth, those costs aren't simply paid by the company owners. Instead, some of the costs are passed along in the form of higher prices.As I noted in recent congressional testimony, the fact that regulations cause prices to increase -- a regulatory premium, so to speak -- isn't news. But the fact that this premium contributes to poverty is. Recent research demonstrates the regressive nature of the regulatory premium. The big-ticket items on a low-income household's budget -- housing, electricity, telephone services -- are also some of the most heavily regulated goods, and therefore bear a high regulatory premium. Conversely, high-income households spend a smaller percentage of budgets on highly regulated goods, resulting in a relatively low regulatory premium.Perhaps Mr. Trump's voters aren't simply voting for him but instead are voting against a federal regulatory system that consistently produces results that hurt, rather than help, the economically challenged.Patrick McLaughlin, Ph.D.George Mason UniversityArlington, Va.",3/12/16
"Trump's America; There's nothing irrational about Donald Trump's appeal to the white working class, writes Charles Murray: they have every reason to be angry",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764718413?accountid=12768,"If you are dismayed by Trumpism, don't kid yourself that it will fade away if Donald Trump fails to win the Republican nomination. Trumpism is an expression of the legitimate anger that many Americans feel about the course that the country has taken, and its appearance was predictable. It is the endgame of a process that has been going on for a half-century: America's divestment of its historic national identity.For the eminent political scientist Samuel Huntington, writing in his last book, ""Who Are We?"" (2004), two components of that national identity stand out. One is our Anglo-Protestant heritage, which has inevitably faded in an America that is now home to many cultural and religious traditions. The other is the very idea of America, something unique to us. As the historian Richard Hofstadter once said, ""It has been our fate as a nation not to have ideologies but to be one.""What does this ideology--Huntington called it the ""American creed""--consist of? Its three core values may be summarized as egalitarianism, liberty and individualism. From these flow other familiar aspects of the national creed that observers have long identified: equality before the law, equality of opportunity, freedom of speech and association, self-reliance, limited government, free-market economics, decentralized and devolved political authority.Related Reading* Election 2016: The Life of the Party (Jan. 29, 2016)* A Century of Political Spin (Jan 8, 2016)* The Middle-Class Squeeze (Sept. 25, 2015)* Donald Trump's New Version of an Old Political Fantasy (Aug. 14, 2015)As recently as 1960, the creed was our national consensus. Running that year for the Democratic nomination, candidates like John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert Humphrey genuinely embraced the creed, differing from Republicans only in how its elements should be realized.Today, the creed has lost its authority and its substance. What happened? Many of the dynamics of the reversal can be found in developments across the whole of American society: in the emergence of a new upper class and a new lower class, and in the plight of the working class caught in between.In my 2012 book ""Coming Apart,"" I discussed these new classes at length. The new upper class consists of the people who shape the country's economy, politics and culture. The new lower class consists of people who have dropped out of some of the most basic institutions of American civic culture, especially work and marriage. Both of these new classes have repudiated the American creed in practice, whatever lip service they may still pay to it. Trumpism is the voice of a beleaguered working class telling us that it too is falling away.Historically, one of the most widely acknowledged aspects of American exceptionalism was our lack of class consciousness. Even Marx and Engels recognized it. This was egalitarianism American style. Yes, America had rich people and poor people, but that didn't mean that the rich were better than anyone else.Successful Americans stubbornly refused to accept the mantle of an upper class, typically presenting themselves to their fellow countrymen as regular guys. And they usually were, in the sense that most of them had grown up in modest circumstances, or even in poverty, and carried the habits and standards of their youths into their successful later lives.America also retained a high degree of social and cultural heterogeneity in its communities. Tocqueville wrote of America in the 1830s as a place where ""the more opulent citizens take great care not to stand aloof from the people."" That continued well into the 20th century, even in America's elite neighborhoods. In the 1960 census, the median income along Philadelphia's Main Line was just $90,000 in today's dollars. In Boston's Brookline, it was $75,000; on New York's Upper East Side, just $60,000. At a typical dinner party in those neighborhoods, many guests would have had no more than a high-school diploma.In the years since, the new upper class has evolved a distinctive culture. For a half-century, America's elite universities have drawn the most talented people from all over the country, socialized them and often married them off to each other. Brains have become radically more valuable in the marketplace. In 2016, a dinner party in those same elite neighborhoods consists almost wholly of people with college degrees, even advanced degrees. They are much more uniformly affluent. The current median family incomes for the Main Line, Brookline and the Upper East Side are about $150,000, $151,000 and $203,000, respectively.And the conversation at that dinner party is likely to be completely unlike the conversations at get-togethers in mainstream America. The members of the new upper class are seldom attracted to the films, TV shows and music that are most popular in mainstream America. They have a distinctive culture in the food they eat, the way they take care of their health, their child-rearing practices, the vacations they take, the books they read, the websites they visit and their taste in beer. You name it, the new upper class has its own way of doing it.Another characteristic of the new upper class--and something new under the American sun--is their easy acceptance of being members of an upper class and their condescension toward ordinary Americans. Try using ""redneck"" in a conversation with your highly educated friends and see if it triggers any of the nervousness that accompanies other ethnic slurs. Refer to ""flyover country"" and consider the implications when no one asks, ""What does that mean?"" Or I can send you to chat with a friend in Washington, D.C., who bought a weekend place in West Virginia. He will tell you about the contempt for his new neighbors that he has encountered in the elite precincts of the nation's capital.For its part, mainstream America is fully aware of this condescension and contempt and is understandably irritated by it. American egalitarianism is on its last legs.While the new upper class was seceding from the mainstream, a new lower class was emerging from within the white working class, and it has played a key role in creating the environment in which Trumpism has flourished.Work and marriage have been central to American civic culture since the founding, and this held true for the white working class into the 1960s. Almost all of the adult men were working or looking for work, and almost all of them were married.Then things started to change. For white working-class men in their 30s and 40s--what should be the prime decades for working and raising a family--participation in the labor force dropped from 96% in 1968 to 79% in 2015. Over that same period, the portion of these men who were married dropped from 86% to 52%. (The numbers for nonwhite working-class males show declines as well, though not as steep and not as continuous.)These are stunning changes, and they are visible across the country. In today's average white working-class neighborhood, about one out of five men in the prime of life isn't even looking for work; they are living off girlfriends, siblings or parents, on disability, or else subsisting on off-the-books or criminal income. Almost half aren't married, with all the collateral social problems that go with large numbers of unattached males.In these communities, about half the children are born to unmarried women, with all the problems that go with growing up without fathers, especially for boys. Drugs also have become a major problem, in small towns as well as in urban areas.Consider how these trends have affected life in working-class communities for everyone, including those who are still playing by the old rules. They find themselves working and raising their families in neighborhoods where the old civic culture is gone--neighborhoods that are no longer friendly or pleasant or even safe.These major changes in American class structure were taking place alongside another sea change: large-scale ideological defection from the principles of liberty and individualism, two of the pillars of the American creed. This came about in large measure because of the civil rights and feminist movements, both of which began as classic invocations of the creed, rightly demanding that America make good on its ideals for blacks and women.But the success of both movements soon produced policies that directly contradicted the creed. Affirmative action demanded that people be treated as groups. Equality of outcome trumped equality before the law. Group-based policies continued to multiply, with ever more policies embracing ever more groups.By the beginning of the 1980s, Democratic elites overwhelmingly subscribed to an ideology in open conflict with liberty and individualism as traditionally understood. This consolidated the Democratic Party's longtime popularity with ethnic minorities, single women and low-income women, but it alienated another key Democratic constituency: the white working class.White working-class males were the archetypal ""Reagan Democrats"" in the early 1980s and are often described as the core of support for Mr. Trump. But the grievances of this group are often misunderstood. It is a mistake to suggest that they are lashing out irrationally against people who don't look like themselves. There are certainly elements of racism and xenophobia in Trumpism, as I myself have discovered on Twitter and Facebook after writing critically about Mr. Trump.But the central truth of Trumpism as a phenomenon is that the entire American working class has legitimate reasons to be angry at the ruling class. During the past half-century of economic growth, virtually none of the rewards have gone to the working class. The economists can supply caveats and refinements to that statement, but the bottom line is stark: The real family income of people in the bottom half of the income distribution hasn't increased since the late 1960s.During the same half-century, American corporations exported millions of manufacturing jobs, which were among the best-paying working-class jobs. They were and are predominantly men's jobs. In both 1968 and 2015, 70% of manufacturing jobs were held by males.During the same half-century, the federal government allowed the immigration, legal and illegal, of tens of millions of competitors for the remaining working-class jobs. Apart from agriculture, many of those jobs involve the construction trades or crafts. They too were and are predominantly men's jobs: 77% in 1968 and 84% in 2015.Economists still argue about the net effect of these events on the American job market. But for someone living in a town where the big company has shut the factory and moved the jobs to China, or for a roofer who has watched a contractor hire illegal immigrants because they are cheaper, anger and frustration are rational.Add to this the fact that white working-class men are looked down upon by the elites and get little validation in their own communities for being good providers, fathers and spouses--and that life in their communities is falling apart. To top it off, the party they have voted for in recent decades, the Republicans, hasn't done a damn thing to help them. Who wouldn't be angry?There is nothing conservative about how they want to fix things. They want a now indifferent government to act on their behalf, big time. If Bernie Sanders were passionate about immigration, the rest of his ideology would have a lot more in common with Trumpism than conservatism does.As a political matter, it is not a problem that Mr. Sanders doesn't share the traditional American meanings of liberty and individualism. Neither does Mr. Trump. Neither, any longer, do many in the white working class. They have joined the other defectors from the American creed.Who continues to embrace this creed in its entirety? Large portions of the middle class and upper middle class (especially those who run small businesses), many people in the corporate and financial worlds and much of the senior leadership of the Republican Party. They remain principled upholders of the ideals of egalitarianism, liberty and individualism.And let's not forget moderate Democrats, the spiritual legatees of the New Deal. They may advocate social democracy, but they are also unhappy about policies that treat Americans as members of groups and staunch in their support of freedom of speech, individual moral responsibility and the kind of egalitarianism that Tocqueville was talking about. They still exist in large numbers, though mostly in the political closet.But these are fragments of the population, not the national consensus that bound the U.S. together for the first 175 years of the nation's existence. And just as support for the American creed has shrunk, so has its correspondence to daily life. Our vaunted liberty is now constrained by thousands of petty restrictions that touch almost anything we want to do, individualism is routinely ignored in favor of group rights, and we have acquired an arrogant upper class. Operationally as well as ideologically, the American creed is shattered.Our national identity is not altogether lost. Americans still have a vivid, distinctive national character in the eyes of the world. Historically, America has done a far better job than any other country of socializing people of many different ethnicities into displaying our national character. We will still be identifiably American for some time to come.There's irony in that. Much of the passion of Trumpism is directed against the threat to America's national identity from an influx of immigrants. But the immigrants I actually encounter, of all ethnicities, typically come across as classically American--cheerful, hardworking, optimistic, ambitious. Keeping our national character seems to be the least of our problems.Still, even that character is ultimately rooted in the American creed. When faith in that secular religion is held only by fragments of the American people, we will soon be just another nation--a very powerful one, a very rich one, still called the United States of America. But we will have detached ourselves from the bedrock that has made us unique in the history of the world.Mr. Murray is the W.H. Brady Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

What to Expect if Republican Convention Is Contested; Losses in both Ohio and Florida could upend Donald Trump's march toward nomination,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772543171?accountid=12768,"CINCINNATI--If Ohio Gov. John Kasich or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio triumph in the winner-take-all primaries in their home states Tuesday, the odds are the Republican National Committee delegates will face a contested convention when they gather in Cleveland in July.At this point, only front-runner Donald Trump has a clear shot at winning the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the GOP nomination from the contests in states and territories. But losses in both Ohio and Florida could upend his march to the nomination.With most of the remaining states allocating delegates proportionally, Messrs. Rubio and Kasich are holding out hope they could prevail at a convention at which no candidate enters with a majority. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz maintains he could win the nomination outright, but his path to doing so is steep, and he and Mr. Trump could face a hostile environment among the party faithful at the convention.So if the party's nominee isn't clear by July, the most likely scenario is a contested Republican convention, something that hasn't happened since before the invention of color television. Here's a primer on how it could happen and how it would work.What would cause a contested convention?If no candidate wins 1,237 delegates during the primaries, caucuses and conventions in the states and territories, choosing a nominee would default to the convention delegates. Most of them are bound by their state results on the first ballot when the RNC meets in July in Cleveland, but after that rules allow almost all of them to vote for the candidate of their choice on subsequent ballots.Whether won through primaries and caucuses or during a floor fight in Cleveland, Republicans require their nominee to have at least 1,237 delegates, a majority of those elected to the convention. A plurality isn't enough, though if one candidate has a significant lead but isn't quite to 1,237, there may be significant pressure to coalesce behind him.How are delegates to the Republican National Convention selected?In most states, delegates are elected at state party conventions through a process that begins with local gatherings by precinct, county or some other smaller jurisdiction. But each state has its own process. In Illinois, voters in Tuesday's primary will pick delegates directly on their ballots. The candidate who triumphs in Ohio's winner-take-all contest will submit his own slate of delegates for approval by the Secretary of State's office.What is the obligation of convention delegates to support a specific candidate?After 2012, when Ron Paul wrested some delegates away from Mitt Romney in states the former Massachusetts governor won, the RNC asked states to bind delegates to candidates for at least one ballot, provided their candidate remains in the race.But again, the rules vary by state. If no candidate is elected on the first ballot, most states allow their delegates to become free agents, but some have extra requirements.Georgia and Maryland bind their delegates to their candidate through two ballots, unless the candidate receives less than 35% support on the first ballot. Kansas binds its delegates until a candidate formally releases them. Florida's winner-take-all delegates are bound through three ballots at the convention.And in Pennsylvania, the 14 at-large delegates are bound for one ballot, but the state's 54 congressional district delegates are elected directly on the primary ballot and are free agents even during the convention's first ballot.Many states also allow their delegates to make their own choice if the candidate backed by primary voters ends his or her campaign or releases the delegates. Usually this makes delegates free agents, but not always.South Carolina's delegates, all 50 of whom are now bound to Donald Trump, would automatically go to the state's second-place finisher, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, if Mr. Trump isn't nominated on the first ballot.There's a lot of talk about Democratic superdelegates. Do Republicans have those too?No. Democratic superdelegates are party leaders and state and former elected officials who are free to back the candidate of their choosing. In 2008, some of those party insiders initially backed Hillary Clinton and, after the long-fought primary, switched to then-Sen. Barack Obama, prompting a big intraparty skirmish that Mrs. Clinton lost.The Republicans have nothing comparable to those delegates. For most states, GOP delegates are elected in two buckets: at-large statewide and by congressional district, plus three for the RNC members from each state and territory.What is the threshold for a Republican candidate to be nominated for president?In 2012, RNC members, prodded by the Romney campaign, instituted a rule requiring any candidate to have won a majority of delegates in eight states to be nominated for president. The standard was meant to block Mr. Paul from creating mischief at the convention that year.This rule remains on the books but like almost every RNC rule, it is subject for review by the party's Rules Committee, which is scheduled to meet the week before the July convention in Cleveland. When it meets, the Rules Committee will determine eligibility requirements for its candidates, among a host of other bylaws that will govern the convention.The Rules Committee, which will be selected from delegates elected by the states and territories, will decide whether to limit potential candidates at the convention to those who mounted presidential campaigns or open it up by providing an avenue for Mr. Romney or House Speaker Paul Ryan to be considered for the nomination.The latter scenario could lead to bedlam in Cleveland, particularly if momentum builds for a potential consensus candidate like Mr. Ryan or Mr. Romney, both of whom have disavowed any interest in running.What's the precedent for Republicans requiring multiple ballots to choose a nominee? How could that happen this time?The last time Republicans entered their convention without a surefire nominee was 1976. That year, President Gerald Ford, who moved into the Oval Office after President Richard Nixon was forced to resign, prevailed over Ronald Reagan on the first ballot in Kansas City, Mo. That quick resolution may not be in the cards for 2016. And the last time it took multiple ballots was in 1948, when New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey won the nomination on the third ballot in Philadelphia.Write to Reid J. Epstein at Reid.Epstein@wsj.comCredit: By Reid J. Epstein",3/14/16
No Wonder Trump Does So Well With the Poor; Recent research demonstrates the regressive nature of the regulatory premium.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772306033?accountid=12768,"Your analysis of voting patterns on Super Tuesday is illuminating (""Voting in Poor, Rich Cities Offers Clues to Race Ahead ,"" page one, March 3). Here's another possible reason why Donald Trump dominated in economically challenged cities, while Hillary Clinton's bedrock of support was in relatively high-income areas: Federal regulations disproportionately harm low-income households. Regardless of what benefits regulations may deliver, compliance with them imposes costs on producers. Contrary to popular myth, those costs aren't simply paid by the company owners. Instead, some of the costs are passed along in the form of higher prices.As I noted in recent congressional testimony, the fact that regulations cause prices to increase--a regulatory premium, so to speak--isn't news. But the fact that this premium contributes to poverty is. Recent research demonstrates the regressive nature of the regulatory premium. The big-ticket items on a low-income household's budget--housing, electricity, telephone services--are also some of the most heavily regulated goods, and therefore bear a high regulatory premium. Conversely, high-income households spend a smaller percentage of budgets on highly regulated goods, resulting in a relatively low regulatory premium.Perhaps Mr. Trump's voters aren't simply voting for him but instead are voting against a federal regulatory system that consistently produces results that hurt, rather than help, the economically challenged.Patrick McLaughlin, Ph.D.George Mason UniversityArlington, Va.",3/14/16

Ted Cruz and barely ahead of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.It appears that the New York billionaire's decision to skip a Republican candidate debate last week in Des Moines may have hurt him late in the Iowa race. As they entered the caucuses Monday, voters said they favored Mr. Rubio by 27%, compared with 21% for Mr. Cruz and 16% for Mr. Trump, according to entrance surveys. Those who decided in the last few days broke away even further from Mr. Trump, who got only 13% of that vote.Those late-deciding voters made up 35% of Monday's turnout. Mr. Trump was most popular with those who decided more than one month ago, suggesting that he failed to grow his core support in the homestretch.Mr. Trump said he refused to participate in the Fox News debate because he didn't trust anchor Megyn Kelly to treat him fairly. He also blamed a glib press release the network sent out in response to his boycott threat.Mr. Trump also failed to capture a majority of younger voters. He won 20% of the 17 to 24-year-olds, while Messrs. Rubio and Cruz each took 25% of that age group. And he didn't eat deeply into the support for the winning candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz, among Iowa's very conservative voters.Credit: By Beth Reinhard",3/14/16
Cruz Vaults Past Trump in Iowa --- Rubio surges to close third as GOP voters turn out in record numbers for first 2016 contest,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761637520?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz outmuscled Donald Trump to win the Iowa caucuses on Monday, delivering a stinging rebuke to the celebrity businessman and establishing himself as a leading contender for the nomination.The results Monday set the stage for a series of high-stakes showdowns in the weeks ahead between the top two finishers and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose appeal as a general-election candidate was good enough for a late surge that nearly overtook Mr. Trump.""Tonight is a victory for the grass roots,"" said Mr. Cruz to a raucous victory party in Des Moines. ""Tonight is a victory for millions of Americans who have shouldered the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok.""Mr. Trump kept his post-caucus remarks brief, thanking his family and the state of Iowa before turning his attention to contests that follow. ""We love New Hampshire, we love South Carolina,"" he said.The race in Iowa exposed cracks in Mr. Trump's front-runner status. After a six-month ride atop the polls, his stardom wasn't enough to overcome Mr. Cruz's superior turnout machine and the Texan's appeal with the party's most conservative voters.With 99% of the precincts reporting, Mr. Cruz led the GOP field as the top pick of 27.7% of Republican caucusgoers, followed by Mr. Trump at 24.3% and Mr. Rubio at 23.1%.Mr. Cruz's victory was a remarkable turnaround for a candidate who entered the race as a little-known long shot, his rise a reflection of how much the GOP is now moved by the tea party and evangelical voters who have flocked to him.The Texan generated his highest levels of support in Iowa from the most conservative caucusgoers, according to an entrance poll conducted for news organizations. He also performed well among evangelicals and Republicans who said he shared their values.Mr. Rubio's late surge will increase interest in his candidacy and ratchet up the pressure on less-viable Republicans to drop out of the race to give more centrist, business-friendly voters a clearer alternative to Messrs. Cruz and Trump.""For months, they told us we had no chance,"" Mr. Rubio told hundreds of cheering supporters Monday night. ""Tonight, here in Iowa, the people of this great state sent a very clear message.""Mr. Rubio outpaced his rivals by big margins on the question of which candidate Republicans think can win in November, the entrance poll showed. He also built a big edge among caucusgoers who want the next president to be experienced. Those will be strong selling points in states where the electorate is less conservative than Iowa.Messrs. Cruz and Trump had traded increasingly nasty barbs in the run-up to Iowa, setting up for a more bitter battle to follow. Mr. Trump has picked fights with rivals, major media organizations and party leaders in Washington, frequent skirmishes that have allowed him to dominate news coverage and drown out other Republicans with more typical resumes.The Iowa results cement the top tier of the Republican field, and most of the contenders are expected to continue on to New Hampshire. But former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was a casualty of the Iowa caucuses, announcing on Twitter that he was withdrawing from the race.Mr. Trump will get a chance to re-establish himself in states where polls show him up by as much as 20 percentage points -- although he had led in most Iowa polls before the caucuses began.In addition, many back-of-the-pack contenders ended 2015 with enough money to finance bare-bones campaigns through the first four nominating states in February, new campaign-finance reports suggest.""These first four races are going to set the playoffs,"" said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid. ""To advance, you need to do well in these first four.""Republicans may have to wait until the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20 or possibly Super Tuesday on March 1 to get a clearer sense of which of the candidates have the strongest claim on the nomination.Anger and frustration were defining features of the GOP electorate. Half described themselves as ""dissatisfied, but not angry"" about the way the federal government is working.A somewhat smaller share said they were outright angry. And half of those Republicans who participated said they wanted the next president to be from outside the political establishment.Big crowds flocked to caucus sites around the state, and early surveys suggested the share of first-time caucusgoers had ticked up from 2012.Total GOP turnout topped 184,000 voters, shattering the previous record of roughly 121,000 caucusgoers. A GOP precinct in Van Meter ran out of ballots and forms to register new voters. ""We're way past capacity,"" said Bev McLinden, a local GOP official.There were pockets of the state where Mr. Trump didn't register any support. At a caucus meeting in Pleasant Hill, none of the hundreds of Republicans in attendance rose to speak on his behalf. ""They said he had no ground game,"" said Mary Dorin, a Cruz supporter.At a caucus in Cedar Rapids, Mr. Cruz made his own case to the assembled voters, telling them he has the money to compete late into the nominating calendar by citing his conservatism and his ability to win a general election.Mr. Trump's improbable rise already has turned the race on its ear. The billionaire barely registered in public-opinion surveys last spring when he started making noise about a possible presidential bid, trailing by wide margins both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race in September.Mr. Trump drew his highest levels of support from caucusgoers who didn't attend college, were more moderate and, first and foremost, listed immigration as their top issue, the entrance poll showed. He also drew higher support from caucusgoers eager for an outsider.First-time caucusgoer Rachael Schwartz, 28, the mother of an 18-month-old daughter, said she likes Mr. Trump because he is outspoken and would let people make more decisions about their lives, such as whether to vaccinate their children. ""I never paid attention to the future, and now it's important to me,"" she said. ""I believe he's for the people, and we will truly have a voice.""Mr. Trump's often-incendiary campaign rhetoric has turned off some would-be supporters who otherwise appreciate his brash style.Valerie Martin, 36, a nurse midwife who attended the Cruz event in Jefferson, was leaning toward Mr. Trump before settling on his main rival. ""I don't know how he will be taken by other countries,"" she said.Viability was a big lure on Monday as Republicans who planned to back other candidates decided to support one of the top-three.Landon Myer, a quarry worker from Claire, Iowa was leaning toward Mr. Cruz, after considering Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. ""Cruz is the only one that's going to stop Trump,"" said Mr. Myer. ""I feel a vote for Rand Paul is a wasted vote.""---Ben Kesling contributed to this article.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor and Janet Hook",3/14/16

GOP Infighters Need to Focus on Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764281102?accountid=12768,"Tuesday's outcome in New Hampshire means two things: First, Donald Trump, while not unstoppable, is more likely than any other Republican to be the GOP nominee. Bet on Donald, but heavier on the field. Second, Bernie Sanders will win plenty of delegates, enough to influence the Democratic platform.Mr. Trump had a very good night. He outperformed his poll numbers, receiving 35% of the vote, four points higher than his Real Clear Politics average going into Tuesday. The businessman ran equally well among Republicans and independents (who can vote in the state's open primary).The Donald's tone in his victory speech was much improved. He movingly paid tribute to his parents. Gone were incessant references to polls. So, too, were insults about his competitors, replaced by praise of them as ""really talented people . . . terrific.""Mr. Trump even strung together a rudimentary platform, pledging to negotiate better trade deals, take care of veterans, build a border wall, replace ObamaCare, create jobs and ""knock the hell out of ISIS."" He now must flesh out and defend these platitudes, as Republicans hit him for supporting single-payer health care and saying that he won't increase the defense budget.Second-place finisher John Kasich benefited enormously from having hosted 106 New Hampshire town halls, a feat he cannot replicate in South Carolina before its Feb. 20 primary. The Ohio governor is likely a one-state candidate -- or, at best, a regional one, with future strength only in the central Midwest.The overwhelming nature of Mr. Trump's victory threatens Tuesday's third-place finisher, Ted Cruz. He played down his chances in New Hampshire but quietly focused on carrying the state's evangelicals, who made up 23% of the GOP turnout. Even so, Mr. Trump beat Mr. Cruz among evangelicals, 28% to 24%. If that happens in South Carolina, and in the southern ""SEC primaries"" on March 1, the Texas Senator is toast. Mr. Cruz must confront the New York hotelier, and not just on social issues as he pledged to do Tuesday night.Then there are the Floridians, former Gov. Jeb Bush, finishing fourth, and Sen. Marco Rubio, fifth. After his surprise Iowa performance, Mr. Rubio was expected to do well in New Hampshire -- until his robotic meltdown in Saturday's debate. Now Mr. Bush is the one with a semblance of momentum.The Granite State winnowed the GOP field to those five. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina dropped out Wednesday. Poor showings and an empty war chest will end the candidacy of surgeon Ben Carson. Still, five candidates is too many. If they all hang on until mid-March, the chances of nominating a mainstream Republican may dissipate.Messrs. Kasich, Cruz, Bush and Rubio must resist the temptation to go after one another -- which only wastes vital time -- and instead concentrate fire on Mr. Trump. South Carolina is a great venue to pop him on defense spending and health care. They must also bring up the front-runner's greatest weakness: Americans have never elected a serial bankrupt. Populist South Carolinians may not understand why, when Mr. Trump's companies went under, such a wealthy man didn't dip into his fortune to do right by the people who were hurt.There is also Mr. Trump's claim to be a great businessman: His casinos never reported a profit. The only person who may have made big money on them was The Donald, when he sold. So far Mr. Trump's response to the bankruptcy charge has been that he ""took advantage of the laws."" Thoroughly airing the issue will provide an opportunity for him to give a better answer -- or for Republicans to decide they don't want a nominee with such baggage.Democrats are also in a pickle. Mr. Sanders beat Hillary Clinton across the board: among voters of both genders and most racial, age, education, income and ideological groups. Mrs. Clinton won only voters 65 and older and those making over $200,000 a year.The self-proclaimed socialist celebrated by promising a raft of free things, and stirring up envy and class resentment. He is firmly inside Hillary Clinton's head, causing her to offer a paler version of his left-wing agenda. Still, she leads in states coming up, where the Democratic electorate is not 93% white, as in New Hampshire. And even Democrats may realize how toxic his socialist vision is.If you had predicted last summer that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders would overwhelmingly win New Hampshire, you might have been placed in an institution. Now, you would be seen as prophetic.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the 1896 Election Still Matters"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",3/15/16
Trump's Eminent Disdain,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764280119?accountid=12768,"You can't build a real estate empire unless government helps you snatch private property, or so says Donald Trump, who routinely defends eminent domain as an inevitable business reality. Maybe he needs broader business experience.In Saturday's Republican debate, Mr. Trump fielded a question about eminent domain and had a ready answer. ""You need eminent domain,"" Mr. Trump said. ""A lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are,"" they ""all want the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet, OK?""Not OK, or accurate. In the decade since TransCanada proposed the pipeline system, which includes the Keystone XL route President Obama rejected last year, the company says it has negotiated voluntary easements with 96% of 2,600 landowners across 3,000 miles and nine states. That includes 100% of landowners on the Keystone XL path in Montana and South Dakota, and 91% in Nebraska. TransCanada has on rare occasion turned to eminent domain, a process that usually involves a panel of experts determining fair compensation.In other words, market negotiations have determined what TransCanada offers an owner for using his property in an overwhelming majority of cases. By the way, the company plans to build the 1,179-mile Keystone XL pipeline almost entirely underground, so property owners could forget about the gusher once it was buried.Mr. Trump's version of eminent domain is to bulldoze your house, and he tends to haul in government when he doesn't get his way. In the 1990s a house owned by an elderly widow in Atlantic City blocked a potential limousine parking lot outside a Trump casino. After Vera Coking refused to sell, the state casino authority tried to condemn the place. Ms. Coking prevailed against Mr. Trump after a long legal fight. When Jeb Bush mentioned this tale at Saturday's debate, Mr. Trump assailed the booing audience as Bush partisans.Mr. Trump is spinning property seizure as the price of admission for economic progress, whether bridges or factories, but it isn't true. TransCanada shows that not all developers go the Trump route when closing a deal.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Keystone Supporters, Trump And Eminent Domain Law"" -- WSJ Feb. 17, 2016)",3/15/16
"Election 2016: Blue-Collar Evangelicals to Test Trump --- In South Carolina, GOP contender faces battle for one of the state's key voting blocs",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764279937?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump faces a new kind of test as the presidential nominating contest moves to the South, where many of the blue-collar voters that have formed his base of support are also evangelical Christians open to appeals from social conservatives.Mr. Trump carried a broad set of voter groups in winning the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, including evangelical Christians. But his support has been strongest among secular, blue-collar voters -- those who attend religious services infrequently and who don't identify as evangelicals, opinion polls and results from the first two contests show.Now, the Republican candidates head into states where blue-collar voters are more plentiful -- and the largest share are evangelical Christians. That sets up a test of whether blue-collar evangelicals will side with Mr. Trump or favor candidates such as Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who are more identified with the antiabortion movement and other conservative social causes.Mr. Cruz won evangelicals without a college degree in Iowa on his way to a first-place finish in last week's caucuses. Mr. Trump won them in New Hampshire on Tuesday.Mr. Cruz signaled Tuesday night that the battle was on for such voters. Speaking after his third-place finish in New Hampshire, he said the Republican Party needed to reunite Ronald Reagan's coalition of conservatives, evangelicals and ""especially, especially Reagan Democrats, the blue-collar voters who the Democratic Party has abandoned.""Education and income have proved to be broad dividing lines within the GOP presidential field, national Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling has found. Only 38% of Mr. Trump's supporters had a four-year college degree in December and January polling, while 46% of people backing socially conservative candidates as a group, including Mr. Cruz, had college degrees.Mr. Cruz's edge among college-educated voters has also appeared among evangelical Christians. He won that group in both nominating contests so far, even topping Mr. Trump in New Hampshire.But now more attention will fall on evangelical Christians without a degree, who make up a large share of voters in many states that vote next.Evangelicals without a degree made up 37% of all GOP primary voters in 2012 in South Carolina, where Republicans go to the polls on Feb. 20. That made them one of the state's biggest voting blocs, substantially bigger than college-educated evangelicals and bigger than non-evangelicals of all education levels.Moreover, evangelicals without degrees made up one-third of all voters in nine states that vote by March 1 and were surveyed by exit polls in 2012, a Wall Street Journal analysis of exit polls from past elections shows.In winning New Hampshire, by contrast, Mr. Trump carried a state where only 23% of primary voters were evangelical Christians and 17% of all voters were evangelicals with no college degree.Mr. Trump has put little emphasis on abortion, gay marriage or social issues, and his prominence in the media has made many voters are aware of his three marriages. While those factors might give some religiously observant voters pause, several Republicans in South Carolina said he would do well in the state.Many evangelicals will vote on economic rather than on social concerns, said Rep. Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor, who predicted Mr. Trump's message of ending illegal immigration would draw many of them.""I don't believe faith is what is driving the evangelicals when they go to the polls,"" said Mr. Sanford, who believes a larger factor among blue-collar evangelicals is the decline of manufacturing and competition with migrant labor.""Cruz is clearly selling the idea that are values are under threat. Trump is selling the idea that our livelihood and country are under threat,"" said Oran Smith, president of the Palmetto Family Council, an evangelical public policy group in South Carolina. He said both candidates, as well as Mr. Rubio, could do well among evangelicals, but that Mr. Trump's economic message could particularly resonate among blue-collar evangelicals.Credit: By Aaron Zitner, Dante Chinni and Jennifer Levitz",3/15/16
Trump Among the Canaries,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764279882?accountid=12768,"The one reliably true thing we are witnessing in this 2016 election season is a bipartisan repudiation of Barack Obama's presidency.When Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire vote for a socialist senator because 79% of them say they are worried about the direction of the economy, the incumbent president's seven years in office takes the fall.When Republican voters make clear that their state of angst and anger is such that they will cast their unhappy lot with Donald Trump, that reflects disgust with Barack Obama's conduct of the American presidency.This isn't raised merely to throw sand on Mr. Obama's last year. It is more serious than that. New Hampshire's voters, all present for the Obama experience, are the canaries in the coal mines of American political life.Just as dying canaries warned coal workers that the shaft was filling with toxic gases, New Hampshire's voters have told the political status quo, to coin a phrase, you are killing us.Donald Trump owns the 35% of the Republican electorate that is hacked off about everything. In nearly every exit-poll category -- age, ideology, the economy, terror -- Mr. Trump has at least 35% secured.What this means for the other candidates is they cannot possibly compete with Donald Trump on his terms, on display in his victory speech Tuesday, which began contained and ended semi-unhinged.A story from the political past will illustrate. In 1958, when George Wallace, then considered something of a Southern liberal, lost the Alabama governorship to a segregationist candidate, he remarked, ""I will never be out-segged again."" Wallace became the premier angry-man populist of his era, running in four presidential races.No one is going to out-rant Donald Trump about the state of America. Chris Christie got in as the tough-guy candidate. He's gone, unable to compete with the Marvel Comics character Donald Trump created.Ted Cruz especially had better reflect. Mr. Cruz's path to the nomination runs through the Southern states and leans heavily on evocative rhetoric and buzzwords -- primarily immigration and attacking Washington and ""them.""But Donald Trump owns all of that, and will so long as four or five candidates are dispersing the other 65% of the GOP vote. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have the money and mutual animosity to go on. Ben Carson won't quit. John Kasich is talking about winning Michigan -- in a month.If Mr. Trump's persona is impermeable, the other candidates will have to go after him on substance.Mr. Trump has been floating in an inch-deep pool of policy and shows no inclination to expand his pre-existing knowledge of anything. It will require patience and persistence, but his opponents have no choice but to start challenging the implications of what he says and criticizing it in detail.At the core of the Trump campaign is one policy idea: imposing a 45% tariff on goods imported from China. In his shouted, red-faced victory speech Tuesday, he extended the trade offensive to Japan and Mexico.Some detail: Combining the value of goods we sell to them and they to us, China, Mexico and Japan are the U.S's Nos. 1, 3 and 4 trading partners (Canada is No. 2). They are 35% of the U.S.'s trade activity with the world. The total annual value of what U.S. producers -- and of course the workers they employ -- sell to those three countries is $415 billion.Wal-Mart has 1.4 million U.S. employees in stores filled with foreign-made consumer goods. With a 45% price increase, many won't be working for long.Mr. Trump says the threat alone of a tariff will cause China to cave. Someone should ask: What happens if they don't cave? Incidentally, unlike Mexico, China has between 200 and 300 nuclear warheads and 2.4 million active-duty forces. Irrelevant?He said Tuesday about drugs: ""We're going to end it at the southern border. It's gonna be over."" How?He said: ""I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created."" How?Another campaign venue Donald Trump owns is the national debates. In New Hampshire, 67% said the debates were important to their decision, suggesting the debates are backing out retail politics. If so, the survivor candidates need a new debate strategy.They will always finish behind Donald Trump if they let the moderators design their performances by making the debate a pinball machine, as ABC did in New Hampshire. The randomness, baiting and irrelevance (immigration, the inevitable debate whipping post is the lowest-rated issue in exit polls) make it hard for voters to shape an impression beyond persona, which Mr. Trump owns.Iowa and New Hampshire revealed there are three GOP voting issues in the primaries: economic anxiety, Islamic terrorism and voters' emotional belief in their candidate. A competitive Trump opponent will find a way to drive those subjects -- and ignore the rest -- across two hours in 30 to 60-second increments.Donald J. Trump reinvented modern media politics. Somebody has about three months to reinvent his invention.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Trump Must Start to Provide Specific Plans"" -- WSJ Feb. 19, 2016)Credit: By Daniel Henninger",3/15/16
The Man Behind Trump Being Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764279369?accountid=12768,"CONCORD, N.H. -- In a stairwell behind the stage as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke at a packed rally recently, campaign manager Corey R. Lewandowski lashed out at his New Hampshire state director.""My boss is working 20-hour days; you're not,"" Mr. Lewandowski said. ""You're not meeting any of your metrics with the primary three weeks away.""In the motorcade afterward, Mr. Lewandowski called a longtime aide supervising another state: ""Fly heretonightand take over.""With that and other late moves, the 41-year-old campaign manager helped assure Mr. Trump's decisive victory Tuesday in the nation's first primary. It was a crucial win for the billionaire businessman after a disappointing second-place finish in Iowa, but it was a do-or-die moment for the relatively anonymous Mr. Lewandowski, who calls the state home and was prepared to resign if his boss lost the primary.""Corey has tremendous energy, a wonderful vision for politics and the greatest candidate ever, without which none of it works,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview Wednesday as he left for South Carolina.As the campaign moves south, Mr. Trump will face renewed resistance in his party; an anti-Trump GOP super PAC is planning an ad blitz there. Meanwhile, the GOP field is narrowing, as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina suspended their campaigns Wednesday after finishing sixth and seventh in New Hampshire. That still leaves four candidates -- Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- battling to derail Mr. Trump.For Mr. Lewandowski, the question is whether he can help his candidate replicate the appeal across demographic and income lines that propelled him to victory in New Hampshire, and continue to improve the campaign's turnout operation. Mr. Trump acknowledged his ground game wasn't strong enough in Iowa. In his Tuesday victory speech, Mr. Trump credited Mr. Lewandowski with fixing that ground game in New Hampshire, then recognized him from the podium.The playbook for Mr. Trump's double-digit first-place finish here, according to Mr. Lewandowski, has been the theory of the campaign from day one and will continue going forward: ""Let Trump be Trump."" Those words have been scrawled on his office white board since Mr. Trump announced his runJune 16.Mr. Lewandowski already is expanding the Trump team to include top advisers from the campaigns of Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who have dropped out and Ben Carson, who has struggled to attract support. He has also expanded the Trump campaign's current roster of 150 employees in 20 states.""There's no substitute for direct personal interaction,"" he said Wednesday.Since Tuesday night, the campaign has been hiring staff in Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi; adding to existing operations in Florida, Ohio and Missouri, and shifting the New Hampshire staff to Massachusetts and elsewhere.""We'll be growing strategically to put in place the tools to win, but remaining a good steward of Mr. Trump's money,"" Mr. Lewandowski said. Indeed, every two weeks, he reviews campaign expenses with Mr. Trump. And while the campaign receives individual donations and revenue from the sale of hats and other items, Mr. Trump has largely been footing the bill himself.After seeing Mr. Trump's efforts to be more positive play well in the final days before New Hampshire voting, the campaign manager decided on Wednesday to pull a negative ad running in South Carolina against Mr. Cruz. With only 10 days until the primary there, the Trump campaign will begin airing on Thursday positive commercials, including one used in New Hampshire in which people with different ethnicities and backgrounds said they were voting for Mr. Trump.Mr. Lewandowski, who downs a dozen Red Bull and Monster Energy drinks daily, resembles his boss in many ways. He's brash and ambitious, demands loyalty and subsists on little sleep. One key difference: Mr. Lewandowski sports a graying buzzcut rather than his boss's golden mane.Though Mr. Lewandowski, a political-science major at the University of Massachusetts, lacks the national profile of some other, more-famous political operatives, he has worked in GOP campaigns much of his career. In his previous job as New Hampshire director of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, he met Mr. Trump backstage at its 2014 conference in Concord.A few months later, Mr. Lewandowski got a call to visit Mr. Trump at his 26th floor office in Trump Tower, where he confided he was weighing a presidential bid. ""Are you better than all the campaign managers out there?"" the billionaire asked. Mr. Lewandowski recalls that he replied: ""I think I am, and I'll work harder than any of them."" He took the $240,000 a year job without first telling his wife, with whom he has four children under ten years old.From the start, the campaign manager set up a bare-bones fifth-floor headquarters in Trump Tower with plastic folding tables on a concrete floor. He brought in three aides who formed the core unit.The quartet dresses the part. Mr. Lewandowski, political director Michael Glassner and social-media guru Daniel Scavino sport Trump Collection silk ties. ""The price is right -- free,"" Mr. Lewandowski quips. Hope Hicks, the communications director and one-time Ralph Lauren model, wears dresses and shoes from Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka's fashion line.When Mr. Lewandowski built out the operation last summer, he bargained hard with consultants and vendors not only to hold down costs, but also to test loyalty to Mr. Trump, he said. A national phone vendor offered his services for a $25,000 monthly fee. ""You can start answering our phones for $2,500 a month,"" the manager told the vendor, who declined.Mr. Trump has ""never said no to any funding request,"" Mr. Lewandowski said. ""We've been lean and all done multiple jobs, but that's made us close.""After Iowa, Mr. Lewandowski said he became ""more motivated, not distressed."" His 68-year-old mother made calls from one of four Trump phone banks; his wife supervised their 9-year-old daughter, seven-year-old twins, nieces, nephews and cousins to stuff envelopes around the family dining-room table outside Manchester.When Mr. Trump arrived in New Hampshire late last week, Mr. Lewandowski and his boss went into a private office at the Manchester headquarters. ""We can knock on every door and call every resident,"" the campaign manager said. ""But most important: If we remain positive and focused on our message, we can win New Hampshire.""That conversation produced a more positive tone to the often-slashing Trump campaign style for the final days of the New Hampshire race.At the debate Saturday night, and at his events until Tuesday's vote, Mr. Trump hit his general themes of strengthening national security and the economy, and largely refrained from attacking his rivals, saying, ""I've become friendly with a lot of them."" But he couldn't resist going after Mr. Bush and he slipped by repeating an audience member's shout-out that Mr. Cruz was ""a pussy.""Having won in New Hampshire, Mr. Trump now faces a potentially stiffer challenge in South Carolina, where television advertising has often played a bigger role in helping candidates cover ground. The more diverse population and a party establishment that has been partial over the years to the Bush family may pose new obstacles. The state also has a large share of evangelical voters, who drove Mr. Cruz to victory over Mr. Trump in Iowa.Mr. Lewandowski showed his determination to improve voter outreach when he stopped Mr. Trump as he was heading out after the last rally before the New Hampshire primary.""Sir, we've got more to do here,"" the campaign manager said to his boss, who was departing for a steak dinner with his family Monday night. Instead, Mr. Lewandowski diverted him to a holding room with about 100 of his best volunteers in the state. ""If we don't have these guys, we don't win,"" the campaign manager said.Mr. Trump then spent the next hour talking to and posing with the volunteers, as Mr. Lewandowski took their pictures himself. Looking at his campaign manager and using his famous line from ""The Apprentice,"" Mr. Trump told the group, ""If we don't win tomorrow, Corey, you're fired.""Credit: By Monica Langley",3/15/16
"'Trump Store' Kiosks Must Go, City Orders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761996240?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's flagship property in Midtown was fined $4,000 by New York City and directed to remove two unauthorized ""Trump Store"" sales counters from the marble lobby of Trump Tower.The mixed-use skyscraper at Fifth Avenue and East 56th Street serves as Mr. Trump's corporate and presidential-campaign headquarters, as well as the home of a Trump Grill, Trump Bar and Trump's Ice Cream Parlor.Both sales counters sell Trump-branded merchandise, from golf shirts to perfume to Mr. Trump's books.At one counter, political supporters can also make campaign contributions, and buy ""Make America Great Again"" baseball caps and other campaign materials.Preservationists have long complained that the installation of the sales counters and the removal of a stone bench in the lobby violated terms of an agreement between Mr. Trump and the city. He received a zoning bonus in exchange for creating a privately owned public space.On Monday, a hearing officer with the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings found that the 40-foot-long sales counters violated architectural plans that were part of a special permit issued in 1979. The permit allowed Mr. Trump to add 105,436 square feet to the 58-story building in exchange for public spaces in the building.""An examination of the referenced plans shows the words, 'marble bench seating,' printed in the area currently occupied by the right counter,"" wrote the hearing officer, Susan Brand. ""The area currently occupied by the left counter is shown to be an unoccupied space.""Michael Cohen, special counsel to Mr. Trump, didn't respond to requests for comment. At a hearing Thursday, Mr. Cohen said he believed the bench had been removed as part of approved renovations when a Gucci store leased space in Trump Tower. The Gucci store opened in 2008.But Mr. Cohen said he was unable to find any permits or plans justifying the change.When a previous violation for a sales counter in the lobby was issued in 2006, Mr. Trump paid the fine but didn't remove the counter.""The space deserves a bench for the public,"" said Jerold Kayden, a professor of urban planning and design at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design and an advocate for privately owned public spaces.At the hearing, Mr. Cohen said that the Trump Organization is in the process of creating other public spaces in the building, including one on the third floor of a five-story atrium, which will have seating near a ""plaque in honor of veterans.""But the judge noted that creating other spaces wouldn't diminish the obligation to comply with the permit.""We had a strong case, and we're pleased that the violation we issued has been upheld,"" said a spokesman for the Department of Buildings. ""If the kiosks are not removed, further enforcement actions will be taken.""Credit: By Josh Barbanel",3/15/16
New Risks for Trump After Defeat in Iowa,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761996232?accountid=12768,"MILFORD, N.H. -- Beaten in Iowa but unbowed, Republican Donald Trump returned Tuesday to the state that has served as his campaign home base facing a new set of challenges in what is likely to be a must-win primary.Iowa winner Ted Cruz arrived in New Hampshire Tuesday with momentum, money and a tested voter-turnout machine -- one strong enough to force Mr. Trump into a second-place caucus finish. That is a sharp departure from recent Iowa GOP winners, who lacked the financial resources to build on their victories and win the nomination.The businessman also has seen his own stature diminished after failing to meet expectations in Iowa, where he led in most polls in the days before Monday's balloting. And a new threat is emerging with the rise of Marco Rubio in the candidate pack. The Florida senator finished third in Iowa, just one percentage point behind Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump must now decide whether he is willing to invest more of his own money into his campaign. He is currently airing less than $1 million in television ads this week aimed at New Hampshire ahead of next Tuesday's primary, according to media trackers. He also must decide whether his campaign has enough time and connections in the state to create a turnout operation that can compete with Mr. Cruz and other challengers who have been building get-out-the-vote machines for months.""He needs to be more focused in his attacks against Rubio and Cruz,"" said Republican consultant Roger Stone, a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump who is also advocating for more TV ads. ""He needs to define Rubio and Cruz as career politicians who just talk a great game, and talk more in a positive way about his economic plan.""Mr. Trump has built his biggest lead in New Hampshire, where he is currently polling 22 points ahead of Mr. Cruz, according to the Real Clear Politics average. The primary looms as a pivotal opportunity for Mr. Trump to notch a win before the nomination fight heads to southern states viewed as friendlier turf for his Texas rival.After hours of unusual silence on Twitter after his brief Iowa concession speech, the New York billionaire Tuesday demanded more credit for his second-place finish. ""The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!""Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening in Milford that he has ""unlimited"" funds to spend on his campaign if he chooses to do so. ""I'm probably $40 million under budget because frankly I haven't had to spend very much,"" he said.He also said he doesn't think he gets enough credit for mostly self-funding his campaign. ""I don't know if it's appreciated really by the voters,"" he said. ""It's a shame because it's a very big thing.""Mr. Trump's allies said they were confident he would maintain his lead in New Hampshire, noting the state typically picks different winners than Iowa and boasts a better record of choosing the eventual nominee.""Mr. Trump doesn't like to lose and very rarely does he lose, so it's a little different, but I think he'll be fine,"" said Massachusetts billionaire car dealer Ernie Boch Jr., who has helped Mr. Trump raise money and is serving as a surrogate on local media. ""The plan remains the same, with of course media and giant rallies. If he thinks he needs to spend more money, he will.""Mr. Trump has invested more than $12 million of his own money into his campaign, according to recently filed reports with the Federal Election Commission, and collected $6 million in donations. He had $7 million in his campaign account at the end of the year, while Mr. Cruz reported almost $19 million in cash on hand.While New Hampshire has typically embraced more moderate candidates than Mr. Cruz, the preacher's son hasorganized a network of pastors around the state and set up a ""Camp Cruz"" for out-of-state volunteers at college dormitories. He had a similar dormitory setup in Iowa.Mr. Cruz's supporters see an opening for him as more centrist candidates such as Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie attack each other -- and Mr. Rubio. Meanwhile, fellow conservative Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, has faded in polls and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee dropped out Monday.""Most candidates like Cruz who are seen as very conservative have to suffer through New Hampshire rather than compete there, biding our time until we get to South Carolina,"" said Kellyanne Conway, head of a super PAC supporting Mr. Cruz. ""We've always had this post-Iowa strategy to get him through all the early states.""She said the PAC has spent $1 million in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, the next three states to hold nominating contests. Radio ads and direct mail are planned for New Hampshire, and the super PAC plans television ads attacking Messrs. Trump and Rubio, she said.After a midday rally in New Hampshire, Mr. Cruz headed for Tuesday evening in Greenville, S.C. ""We're going to compete in New Hampshire but we want to plant a flag in South Carolina as well,"" said Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Mr. Cruz, who sought to lower expectations. ""We've always been the underdog in this race.""Mr. Cruz's victory in Iowa Monday was grounded in a strong turnout from evangelical Christians, but he didn't modify his ideologically-driven message Tuesday.He said that if he won the White House, he would immediately call for an investigation of Planned Parenthood and instruct the Justice Department that the ""persecution of religious liberty ends today.""Still, Fergus Cullen, former New Hampshire GOP chairman, said Mr. Cruz will have a hard time cutting into Mr. Trump's base or picking up voters leaning toward more establishment candidates.Credit: By Beth Reinhard, Janet Hook and Heather Haddon",3/15/16
Rubio's Rise Amid Trump's Slump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761971381?accountid=12768,"So, it turns out that you can't call Iowa voters ""stupid,"" skip a debate in Des Moines because you don't like the moderators and still expect to prevail in the state's caucuses. Who knew?Donald Trump's loss Monday night, which is far more consequential than Ted Cruz's victory, could mean a return to Republican normalcy in an election year that has been almost freakish. Mr. Trump's poll numbers have soared above his rivals' for months -- the Real Clear Politics average puts him at nearly 36%, while none of the other GOP candidates is above 20% -- yet he lost handily in the state where the first votes were cast.Thanks to the voters of Iowa, conservatives awoke Tuesday morning to a political world that made sense again for the first time since Mr. Trump's rise began last summer. They learned that bluster and incivility have not become political virtues. Well-attended rallies are no substitute for traditional campaigning. Sarah Palin is no GOP kingmaker. And religious conservatives -- real ones in the mold of Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum -- still win the Iowa caucuses. Hawkeye voters find Mr. Trump entertaining but not very presidential. Many Republicans haven't made up their minds, and among those tasked with casting the first votes, Donald Trump ranked closer to the third-place candidate, Marco Rubio, than the winner.According to CNN entrance surveys of Republican voters, evangelicals made up 64% of the Iowa electorate, and 34% of them went for Mr. Cruz, which is the main reason he won. Perhaps more impressive, however, was Mr. Rubio's strong showing in a state that doesn't play to his strengths. He wasn't supposed to win, only to exceed expectations, and he did. Mr. Rubio finished third, one point behind Mr. Trump and five points behind the winner. Mr. Trump performed best among caucusgoers who prefer someone who ""tells it like it is,"" while Mr. Rubio won voters who said electability is their top candidate quality. Put another way, Trump supporters want to make a point. Rubio supporters want to elect a president.Mr. Trump's defeat is a serious blow because a large part of his appeal is that he doesn't lose. Iowa Republicans performed a public service in puncturing the media-generated Trump hype, and future coverage of the candidate ought to be more balanced. Heading into the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio both have the momentum. But Mr. Rubio is in a better position to win over eclectic Granite State voters, who are less enamored of Mr. Cruz's social conservatism than are Iowans. And to the extent that Mr. Trump remains a factor in the coming contests, he probably damages Mr. Cruz more than Mr. Rubio.The Republican field is poised to shrink significantly after New Hampshire, but there is still a chance that the number of Democrats running, perhaps in the guise of an independent, could expand. Hillary Clinton's narrow victory in Iowa did nothing to assuage liberals who are concerned about her weaknesses as the would-be nominee. Mrs. Clinton is not worried about losing the nomination to Bernie Sanders. She's worried that he'll expose her vulnerabilities and invite others to hijack her coronation.Last month Mrs. Clinton assured former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is weighing an independent White House bid, that she'll win the nomination and so he needn't run. Since then, we've learned that nearly two dozen emails on the private server she used as secretary of state were not only classified but so sensitive that no portion of them can be released publicly, even in redacted form. And after barely surviving Iowa, Mrs. Clinton may well lose big in New Hampshire to Mr. Sanders, whom Real Clear Politics shows leading by 18 points. We somehow doubt that Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who could finance his own campaign, has been reassured that the Democratic front-runner has everything under control.But even a weakened Mrs. Clinton could win against the wrong Republican nominee. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz are more popular among conservatives but fare worse than Mr. Rubio in head-to-head matchups with the former first lady among the swing voters in battleground states who often decide elections. Mr. Rubio polls better than both GOP rivals among white women, seniors and independents. Among moderates and suburban women, he trails Mrs. Clinton, but unlike Messrs. Trump and Cruz, Mr. Rubio is at least within striking distance.Among Hispanics, all three Republicans trail Mrs. Clinton badly, but some of this may be guilt-by-association for Mr. Rubio. Of the three, he is the only one who hasn't gone out of his way to antagonize Hispanics while discussing illegal immigration, which means he is better positioned to make inroads with this fast-growing voter bloc should he become the nominee. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz are betting that the GOP can win in November by deepening its appeal. Mr. Rubio wants to widen it.---Mr. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Journal contributor, is the author of ""Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed"" (Encounter Books, 2014).Credit: By Jason L.

You're very smart to have voted for me because I'm going to do positive things for this country, starting with this mall I'm looking out over. For starters, I don't know why this is called a ""mall."" Where I come from, New York City--which happens to be the greatest city in the world, and the reason I say that is that I built most of it, and I only build quality, so I think I know what I'm talking about--a mall doesn't look like this. Where are the shops? I see grass, ponds, an obelisk. This is not Cairo.I don't know how much the government paid for the Washington Monument--and I have no problem with George Washington, but he wasn't a businessman--they overpaid. You've got a 560-foot tall structure sitting on some of the most prime real estate in the country, incredible views, including of my new home. People would pay a lot for a duplex co-op in a building like that. I would charge fifteen hundred, two thousand dollars a square foot, and I'd get it. No wonder this government is trillions in debt. . . .With foreign policy, the same. I'm a businessman. Other countries want to do business with us, I'm all for it. Trade, great. I have no problems with people trading with us, but it's going to be fair trade, by which I mean we come out on top. Or they can sell their TVs and cheeses to someone else. Maybe North Korea could use them. Again, it's not complicated. Missiles? Very simple--you aim one at us, I fire 100 at you. So don't go there. . . .That about covers it. I have to go, because the important senators and congressmen are giving me a lavish luncheon in the rotunda. I understand they're serving a lot of shrimp, much better food than they've had in Congress for a long time. Basically they're trying to impress me so I won't cancel their highway projects and ethanol subsidies. I know how they do things. Now they're going to find out how I do things.By the way, I've directed the Treasury to issue a couple billion extra in $100 chips. Enjoy yourselves. It's the dawn of a very great era.",3/17/16

Election 2016: Vets Await Funds Raised by Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764612535?accountid=12768,"GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump's spontaneous approach is running roughshod over political convention, and an impromptu fundraiser event he held for veterans last month illustrates the logistical hurdles such a campaign faces.A Trump website set up a day before the rally to receive donations said as of Thursday nearly $1.7 million was raised online, which Mr. Trump said reached $6 million in total with other donations, but the campaign didn't disclose how much was raised that night. The day after the event, his campaign promised to quickly send the cash to nearly two dozen groups and soon presented a handful of them oversize novelty checks for $100,000 from his foundation.But those big checks can't be cashed, and two weeks later some groups are just beginning to get paid. The majority said they were unsure how or when the pledged donations would reach them, citing difficulties in communicating with the Trump campaign. Such appearances also raised questions about whether the groups' participation in a political event could jeopardize their nonprofit status.While one nonprofit said it received a check immediately after the event, most of the groups said they hadn't heard from the Trump foundation about payment for weeks, which a philanthropy expert described as uncommon.Some of the groups this week received checks, at least one of which appeared to have been sent after questions to the Trump campaign from The Wall Street Journal about the pending payments.In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Trump said ""a lot of the money was sent"" already and criticisms are unfounded because he had no obligation to raise the funds. ""Out of the goodness of my heart, I raised millions of dollars for the vets,"" he said.He said he wasn't seeking political gain from his benevolence. ""I don't think I got publicity out of it all,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I think I would have gotten more publicity out of the debate."" Mr. Trump boycotted a late-January Republican primary debate in Iowa and held the fundraiser at least in part over a tiff with host Fox News and its moderator Megyn Kelly.The campaign declined to comment in response to detailed questions about delays in the distribution of the checks.Veterans issues could be a factor in South Carolina, the next primary state and home to a large military population.The unusual campaign strategy mirrors the ways the billionaire investor and reality television star has defied custom and shaken up the presidential race.""We haven't gotten the actual check yet,"" said Cindy Brodie, director and lead trainer at Partners for Patriots, a nonprofit organization that trains service dogs, who received an oversize check from Mr. Trump at a rally in Council Bluffs days before the Iowa caucuses.""I'm sure they'll get it to us. I'm sure they're very busy,"" she said.The Wall Street Journal attempted to contact all 22 veterans groups that were promised funds, and spoke with many of them multiple times and on Thursday with representatives from more than half to check on the status of payments. Many of the groups said they were contacted for a brief vetting before the event, asked about their overhead costs, but never told they would get money.Three groups confirmed they had received checks; most others reached said they hadn't heard back from the Trump organization about the donations. A few groups said their phone calls and texts to the Trump campaign have gone unanswered.When asked about this discrepancy, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, disputed the accuracy of the information and declined to comment further.Asked weeks ago about the timing of disbursements a day after the Des Moines fundraiser in January, Ms. Hicks said the money would be given out speedily. ""As the money is distributed over the next few days we will keep you informed of the distribution process,"" she said.Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, said at least three groups personally received hand-delivered checks after events in Iowa. All the other funds are being distributed this week through the mail and are continuing to go out, as Mr. Trump doesn't have the ability to hand-deliver all of them, Mr. Lewandowski said.Naomi Levine, who was until recently the chief fundraiser for New York University and director of its George H. Heyman, Jr. Center for Philanthropy and Fundraising, said that within days of holding a gala, she would send out formal letters informing recipients of how much money they were getting and a timetable to receive it. It can take time to collect all the money pledged, but a formal letter should go out regardless within a week or two, she said.One nonprofit group said it was made to feel it needed to bring veterans to rallies in order to receive the funds -- raising thorny questions for the groups, including the possibility that their nonprofit status could be revoked, a risk faced by Mr. Trump's own charity as well.The campaign declined to comment in response to detailed questions about the event potentially threatening the groups' nonprofit status.The Internal Revenue Service grants tax-exempt status to 501 c(3) organizations, which make up the majority of the groups chosen by Mr. Trump.

Group Urges IRS to Probe Trump Foundation Donation to Florida Attorney General; Complaint says donation came when Bondi weighed lawsuit against Trump University,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774657121?accountid=12768,"A Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group filed a complaint Monday with the Internal Revenue Service, urging the agency to investigate whether the Donald J. Trump Foundation Inc. made an illegal donation in 2013 to a political organization associated with Republican Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi while her office was reportedly considering whether to take legal action against Trump University for possible fraud.The complaint filed by the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also asked the IRS to investigate whether the Trump Foundation, a Section 501(c)(3) private foundation prohibited from political activity, violated federal law by failing to disclose the contribution on its tax return.CREW, also a 501(c)(3), is nonpartisan. David Brock, who has been active in supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, is the vice chairman of CREW's board.Hope Hicks, the spokeswoman for the presidential campaign of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, said the contribution was made in error and the matter has been resolved.A spokesman for the IRS said that federal law prohibits the agency from discussing specific taxpayers.A spokesman for Ms. Bondi said she decided not to take legal action against Trump University because her administration had received only one complaint at the time from a consumer about the quality of education provided by the institution.CREW's complaint says that campaign-finance records show the Trump Foundation in September 2013 made a $25,000 donation to a political organization called And Justice for All, a political-action committee associated with Ms. Bondi's re-election campaign, according to state election records. The complaint said the donation was made just days after the Orlando Sentinel reported, citing a spokeswoman for Ms. Bondi, that her office was considering whether to join a lawsuit against Trump University filed by the New York attorney general. Ultimately, Ms. Bondi's office didn't pursue legal action against Trump University.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, in August 2013 sued Donald Trump and Trump University for allegedly defrauding consumers out of $40 million with what he called a ""sham"" university. A New York state appeals court this month said the fraud suit could proceed .Mr. Trump has denied the allegations and accused Mr. Schneiderman of ""gross incompetence"" and of ""wasting millions in taxpayer money"" with the probe. He has said that many students provided positive feedback about their courses at Trump University.Whitney Ray, a spokesman for the Florida Attorney General's Office, said the media reports CREW cited suggest the Trump donation influenced Ms. Bondi's decision not to take action against the university and that those assertions were incorrect. Ms. Bondi's administration had received only one complaint about Trump University from the time she took office in January 2011 until the time the news reports began in September 2013, Mr. Ray said.""After a staff review of the ONE complaint, the decision was rightfully made by our Citizens Services Office to refer the complainant to the New York Attorney General's Office, as their lawsuit sought relief for any and all aggrieved consumers nationwide,"" said Mr. Ray in a statement (emphasis his), noting that no other state had joined New York's suit.He declined to comment on other issues raised in the complaint.A week ago, Ms. Bondi endorsed Mr. Trump over local candidate Sen. Marco Rubio a day before the state's primary race.Ms. Hicks said that the accounts payable department of the Trump Organization had received a donation request from Ms. Bondi and issued a check to And Justice For All from the Trump Foundation. She said the organization didn't realize it was a political group due to the existence of an entity with the same name on the IRS's list of charitable organizations. After realizing that the group supporting Ms. Bondi was, in fact, a political organization, ""an adjustment"" was made, and the matter was resolved, she said.CREW Communications director Jordan Libowitz said the IRS should still look into the matter.""The Trump Foundation apparently gave an illegal political donation, told the IRS it didn't give any political donations, then claimed it gave to a similar but permissible group, which it now claims was an error,"" he said. ""There's enough wrong here that the IRS needs to investigate and determine where the truth lies.""Credit: By Kate O'Keeffe",3/21/16

Trump's Tax Obligation,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766612370?accountid=12768,"One of Donald Trump's claims to presidential competence is his business and financial success, and so he should want voters to see the proof beyond the gilded staircases. He could enhance his credibility on the point by releasing his tax returns.Mr. Trump has dodged questions of when or even if he will produce his tax records. Last October Mr. Trump told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that he'd release his taxes ""at some point,"" adding that ""maybe"" he'd do so when ""we find out the true story on Hillary's emails.""Asked again in January on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Mr. Trump replied that ""we're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time,"" adding that ""I try to pay as little tax as possible.""After John Dickerson pressed him for a timeline on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" last Sunday, Mr. Trump was a little more specific by saying that he hoped to release his returns ""over the next three, four months. We're working on them very hard, and they will be very good.""But if he had ""everything all approved"" in January, why does the businessman need to wait three or four months? He must employ dozens of lawyers. Waiting that long suggests that he'd wait until he wins or loses the nomination, which means before primary voters can get a look. We called the Trump campaign for an update but got no response.Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz haven't released their most recent tax returns either. But Mr. Rubio provided 10 years of returns when he ran for Senate in 2010. Mr. Cruz disclosed tax records from 2006 to 2010 during his 2012 Senate bid.Mr. Trump should release his returns going back at least a decade before Super Tuesday on March 1 so Republican voters can know what they're voting for. In addition to showing how much he's paid in taxes, the records would help clarify how much money he's made or lost from his various businesses. Are his real-estate ventures as profitable as he purports?This is also a matter of practical politics because of the campaign that Democrats will wage against Mr. Trump if he is the Republican nominee. Mitt Romney waited until September 2012 to release his 2011 tax returns, which turned out to a bad political mistake. His relatively low tax rate, thanks to his charitable deductions, became a story two months before the election rather than many months earlier.The delay also allowed Democrats to spread false speculation all summer. In August Harry Reid claimed he'd heard from an ""anonymous source"" that Mr. Romney hadn't paid taxes for 10 years -- no doubt a deliberate lie, but impossible to refute without evidence. Democrats will simply make things up if the record isn't clear. If Mr. Trump's tax records are as ""very beautiful"" as he says, he should be eager to release them for public scrutiny.",3/22/16
Election 2016: Trump Ramps Up Voter Outreach --- Some question quality of his ground game in South Carolina as GOP primary nears,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765230474?accountid=12768,"GREENVILLE, S.C. -- About three dozen Donald Trump volunteers packed a downtown office here Sunday afternoon, using iPads, computers and landlines to contact voters and read detailed scripts praising the candidate.Other supporters fanned out across the region's neighborhoods, rich and poor, holding iPhones with addresses pinned on a map that is linked to a campaign database.Mr. Trump has been criticized in other states for a flawed ground game, and he said his voter-turnout effort fell short in Iowa. In South Carolina, his aides set up shop months ago, trying to buttress a campaign built on star power with more traditional methods.As in prior early-voting states, Mr. Trump leads in public surveys. In one recent poll, conducted Feb. 10-12 by CBS News/YouGov, Mr. Trump's support stood at 42%, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was at 20% and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio had 15%. The challenge is to get those backers to vote in Saturday's primary.""We made 70,000 calls yesterday across the state,"" James Epley, the campaign's director for upstate South Carolina, said Sunday. ""We chuckle when people say we don't have a ground game. Underestimate us at your peril.""Still, many question some aspects of the campaign. The Trump voter lists are still less precise than other campaigns.His biggest support is from working whites without college degrees. Yet on Sunday, a group of volunteers fanned out in a wealthy neighborhood in downtown Spartanburg, about 30 miles from Greenville.Most residents they reached said they were supporting other candidates. ""I'm not going to vote for Donald Trump,"" said Mark VanGeison, who answered the door and said he wasn't interested. More than two dozen voters said they had heard much more from other major candidates by mail, email and phone. Few reported being contacted by the Trump campaign.GOP legislators said they have had lunch, coffee or at least a phone call with many candidates, but few have spoken to Mr. Trump. Evangelical ministers said the same.""For a while I thought the most buzz was for Trump, but I'm not so sure anymore,"" said GOP state Rep. Ralph Kennedy, who said he is undecided.The billionaire businessman's aides dismiss criticism of their approach, saying most traditional campaign spending in Iowa and New Hampshire was a waste, with some candidates shelling out thousands of dollars per vote only to place deep in the pack.Mr. Trump's South Carolina co-chairman, Ed McMullen, a veteran of a GOP think tank, said the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's strategy is his rallies, which average 7,000 to 10,000 people. The campaign asks supporters to sign up online for tickets and uses their contact information to follow up with calls and emails. It also uses demographic modeling to identify likely supporters, he said. Mr. McMullen said no other campaign is ""doing the kind of depth we're doing,"" and other GOP models reliant on publicly available voter files have proven ineffective.""Obama taught us a lot,"" said Mr. McMullen, citing President Barack Obama's data-driven 2008 campaign. ""Republicans in the 2012 cycle with [Mitt] Romney saw a system blow up on Election Day. You wouldn't believe the ineptitude. A lot of people made a lot of money, for nothing.""On Sunday, most volunteers at the Greenville call center said they had never worked for a campaign. Many came from out of state and stayed at a local Econo Lodge.Fuller Parker, a 20 year-old college student, recently drove an RV decorated with Mr. Trump's likeness across South Carolina, parking at Wal-Mart stores to attract voters.""Driving the RV is far better than door knocking, Mr. Parker said. ""They just flock to you when you're driving it.""Yet the execution of the turnout operation can be spotty. Outside a livestock arena in Clemson last Tuesday, Mr. Parker and other volunteers left a sign-up table for supporters unattended as thousands streamed by, many without pausing to jot their names down.South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster, Mr. Trump's most prominent backer in the state, says stumping at the local Lizard's Thicket Southern-cooking restaurant would be a waste of time. ""The difference is, most candidates have to go to the people,"" Mr. McMaster said. ""With Donald Trump, the people come to him.""Credit: By Josh Dawsey and Valerie Bauerlein",3/22/16
Donald Trump's MoveOn.org Moment,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765230436?accountid=12768,"By now it's a cliche that Donald Trump can say anything he wants, and his supporters don't care. They love him for his attitude and bluster, which has become a proxy for their rage against the political machine. Maybe that will be true again after Saturday night's debate in South Carolina, but someone has to point out how the GOP presidential frontrunner has adopted the political left's worldview on fundamental questions -- including blatant distortions of fact.Take his full-throated endorsement of the conspiracy theory that the George W. Bush Administration deliberately lied to get the U.S. into the Iraq war. ""You call it whatever you want. I wanna tell you. They lied,"" Mr. Trump replied to a question by CBS moderator John Dickerson. ""They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.""Despite years of investigation and countless memoirs, there is no evidence for this claim. None. The CIA director at the time, George Tenet, famously called evidence of WMD in Iraq a ""slam dunk."" Other intelligence services, including the British, also believed Saddam Hussein had such programs. After the first Gulf War in 1991 the CIA had been surprised to learn that Saddam had far more WMD capability than it had thought. So it wasn't crazy to suspect that Saddam would attempt to rebuild it after he had expelled United Nations arms inspectors in the late 1990s.President Bush empowered a commission, led by former Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb and federal Judge Laurence Silberman, to dig into the WMD question with access to intelligence and officials across the government. The panel included Patricia Wald, a former chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals appointed by Jimmy Carter, and Richard Levin, president of Yale University at the time.Their report of more than 600 pages concludes that it was the CIA's ""own independent judgments -- flawed though they were -- that led them to conclude Iraq had active WMD programs."" The report adds that ""the Commission found no evidence of political pressure"" to alter intelligence findings: ""Analysts universally asserted that in no instance did political pressure cause them to skew or alter their analytical judgments.""It's fair if the New York businessman wants to tout his opposition to the Iraq war way back when, though he'd soon learn in the Oval Office that Presidents must often make decisions based on imperfect intelligence. Failing to act can be as dangerous as ordering military action, as we learned from Bill Clinton's passivity toward al Qaeda in the late 1990s and President Obama's paralysis on Syria since 2011.But peddling false conspiracy theories ought to be disqualifying behavior in a presidential candidate because it corrodes public trust in democracy. Mr. Trump is claiming that government officials lied so they could send Americans to their deaths, and for what? So Mr. Bush could nearly lose an election over the war in 2004, and Republicans could lose Congress and the White House because of it in 2006 and 2008?MoveOn.org and others on the left have spread these lies for years because they have an unrestrained will to power and they really do believe the United States is the main source of trouble in the world. But this is not a worldview that conservative leaders have adopted, at least until now.We have enough respect for voters to appreciate that they support Mr. Trump for rational reasons. And we'd like to see him start to act more presidential in case he does become the GOP nominee. But his willingness to indulge the most crackpot left-wing conspiracy theory shows the tremendous risk Republicans would be taking if they make him their standard-bearer.",3/22/16

Trump Leads on Eve of S.C. Vote,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767301971?accountid=12768,"GREENVILLE, S.C. -- After a raucous week of campaigning, Donald Trump remains atop polls in the Republican primary field here as voting begins Saturday in the state that brags that it picks presidents.In South Carolina, Mr. Trump is the top pick of 28% of likely Republican primary voters, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll. But that is down eight percentage points from a January survey, and his 16-point lead in the earlier poll has narrowed to five points over Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's 23%. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was third, at 15%, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush followed close behind, at 13%.The crowded contest for second place may mean the primary here won't significantly winnow the field before the Feb. 23 GOP caucuses in Nevada, or even by March 1, when a swath of mostly Southern states will weigh in.""I think this thing goes to Florida,"" said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Bush supporter who was referring to that state's March 15 primary. ""I don't see South Carolina as being a knockout punch for anybody.""While all the candidates promised to soldier on, a broad Trump victory here would cement his status as the Republican-to-beat for the nomination and likely trigger cries from party heavyweights to rally around one alternative.At several events on the South Carolina coast this week, the billionaire businessman asked voters to help him win ""a mandate"" that would propel him easily through the Republican National Convention to become the party's nominee.Meanwhile, the reasons for concern among party insiders about the prospect of a Trump nomination were on full display in the final week of campaigning.Mr. Trump engaged in a highly unusual dispute with Pope Francis over the issue of immigration; he blamed former President George W. Bush for failing to prevent the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001; and on Friday, he urged a boycott of Apple products until the company unlocks a California terrorist's cellphone.""If Trump wins this one, I'm going to have to register as an independent,"" said Laura Duduit, 56 years old, a Rubio supporter who considers herself a staunch Republican. ""That scares me to death.""All of the candidates, except Ohio Gov. John Kasich, worked the Palmetto State on Friday making last-minute pitches.Mr. Kasich has adopted a Northern strategy aimed at winning the nomination, and he will watch the South Carolina results from Massachusetts, a rare non-Southern state voting on March 1. Mr. Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson were tied in the Marist poll for last at 9%.""You like Bushes? We got a pile of Bushes,"" joked Mr. Graham before introducing a half-dozen members of the famous clan, including former first lady Barbara Bush.Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's Cuban-American rival, Mr. Rubio, was campaigning alongside South Carolina's first Indian-American governor, Nikki Haley, and its first African-American senator, Tim Scott. ""A Benetton commercial,"" said Mrs. Haley, referring to the clothing brand known for showcasing diversity.The contrast between the dynastic family reunion and the diverse trio of under-50 politicians reflects the challenges facing Mr. Bush's struggling campaign, which may face calls to exit from the primaries if he performs poorly.The imagery at the Rubio events showed that South Carolina has the potential to revitalize the candidacy of Mr. Rubio after a poor showing in a New Hampshire debate and its Feb. 9 primary.But the hurdles for the entire field could get tougher if Mr. Trump scores a big enough win to claim all 50 of the state's delegates, and he is well positioned to do that.South Carolina awards 29 delegates to the statewide winner and another three to the winner of each of its seven congressional districts. Mr. Trump's statewide lead also translates to specific districts, according to polls of the field. If those results hold, the front-runner may deny other Republicans from claiming a single delegate in the first-in-the-South primary state.""Until the party figures out who his one opponent is, he's going to keep grinding forward, because his base is unshakeable,"" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who won the South Carolina primary in 2012.As the other candidates fight for their slices of supporters, Mr. Trump is the one candidate who has assembled a broader coalition of primary voters who feel abandoned by elected officials and disenfranchised by the political process.He draws his strongest support from likely South Carolina primary voters who haven't participated in past contests and those who didn't attend college, according to polls. And his supporters are more devoted to the political newcomer than any of his rivals.The Trump coalition includes infrequent voters, such as Crystal Ellenburg, of Gaffney, S.C., who attended her first political rally on Thursday night when Mr. Trump addressed thousands in the small city. ""I love him,"" she said. ""He's just so honest.""Some 71% of his backers ""strongly"" support him, according to the Marist survey. Alice Hendershot, 67, said she hangs up when other campaigns call to attack the New York businessman. ""There's no way I would go for any of those people,"" she said.Ian McMillan, 36, of Myrtle Beach, turned out to a Trump rally on Friday to support the Republican because he likes Mr. Trump's blunt style and because the truck driver sees the former reality TV celebrity as a better representative of ""the silent majority.""""I just feel that there's a lot of people in the country that feel like we have a censor on us, and we basically want our leaders to speak for us because we feel undervalued, because our leaders we currently have don't speak for us,"" he said.Still, the share of Republicans who say they would consider supporting Mr. Trump fell to 56% from 65% in January, according to a national Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 400 likely Republican primary voters conducted from Feb. 14-16.The same survey showed Mr. Trump losing to Mr. Cruz in a three-way race in which all the other candidates drop out, and lagging behind both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio if the contest boiled down to a head-to-head match-up, according to the Journal survey.---Josh Dawsey and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor and Beth Reinhard",3/24/16
Election 2016: Trump Leaves Trade Mark,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766612681?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump is making a lasting mark on the Republican Party's stance on free trade, even if he doesn't win the presidential nomination, say backers and foes of trade deals.The billionaire businessman is hardening Republican opposition to trade pacts, and challenging the party orthodoxy on other mainstay issues like deficit reduction.""The wariness is already there among Republicans"" when it comes to trade, said Dartmouth economic historian Douglas Irwin. ""It becomes accentuated when someone like Trump puts it front and center.""The billionaire businessman's strong showing in Iowa, victory in the New Hampshire primary and front-runner status in Saturday's South Carolina race also send the message that his trade position is a winning one with GOP voters.Economists liken Mr. Trump to another populist tycoon who ran for president on a protectionist platform, computer pioneer Ross Perot, who helped legitimize opposition to free-trade deals among Democratic lawmakers.Mr. Perot opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement during the 1992 presidential campaign, where he ran as an independent, and during the subsequent fight over ratification of the deal under newly elected President Bill Clinton in 1993.While Nafta passed by an 34-vote margin in the House, the attention Mr. Perot garnered -- and the business imprimatur he gave to the opposition -- had an enduring impact on Democrats, whose support for free-trade measures was weakening then and has continued to wane.Pat Buchanan, who used his opposition to Nafta and other trade deals to fuel his Republican challenge to President George H.W. Bush during that 1992 presidential campaign season, said the aversion to such agreements has grown.""Now, Republicans have been made aware that these deals can be politically costly and there is a downside to voting for them,"" Mr. Buchanan said in a recent interview.Tony Fratto, a former George W. Bush White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump's influence has helped open a divide on economic issues between the party's pro-business wing and the presidential candidates.Sen. Ted Cruz reversed his position favoring fast track authority to conclude trade deals and now opposes the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated under President Obama. Sen. Marco Rubio voted for fast track but now says he hasn't decided how to vote on TPP. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich still support TPP.The candidates also aren't addressing another Republican establishment standard -- deficit reduction.While all the candidates have proposed plans to slash taxes, which would add heavily to deficits, none have detailed how they would pay for them. According to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed research group, Mr. Trump's proposal would have the largest cost -- somewhere between $10 trillion and $11 trillion over 10 years.In a statement, Mr. Trump said his plan to cut taxes, particularly a proposal to cut corporate taxes by about half to 15%, would boost growth by encouraging U.S. companies to repatriate profits now held overseas and by spurring foreign-owned companies to invest more in the U.S.Next on the trade agenda is the TPP, which includes Japan, Vietnam and Australia. Mr. Trump has called TPP a ""horrible deal."" He says that it will give China -- which isn't a party to the negotiations -- a ""back door"" way to join the agreement later.U.S. trade negotiators have tried to entice China to make changes in its economy, including reducing subsidies and opening service sectors to foreign competition, by telling Beijing such actions could allow China to join TPP later on.Mr. Trump's strong support among GOP voters and his bitter pronouncements against free-trade deals are adding to the problems trade deals now face in Congress.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he won't bring up TPP for a vote before the November election, despite the Obama administration's lobbying for such a measure.Credit: By Bob Davis",3/24/16
Trump's Tax Return Dodge,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767266211?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump didn't become the favorite for the Republican presidential nominee without having political talent -- not least his ability to unleash a torrent of verbiage that ducks a question. If he loses in the end, the guy should start up Trump Political School.Consider the businessman's response Sunday to a question about when he would release his tax returns, as he has already promised to do. George Stephanopoulos of ABC's ""This Week"" quoted our Saturday editorial calling on Mr. Trump to release his returns ""so Republicans can know what they're voting for.""Mr. Stephanopoulos: ""Will you release them by Super Tuesday? Don't Republican voters have a right to know?""Mr. Trump erupted in that now-familiar and calculated way in which he pretends he is the victim of a great injustice:""Well, first, no, I won't. No, no, no, I won't. I'm working on it. We're working on, they're massive. You saw pictures of me. But let me tell you about The Wall Street Journal. I have no respect whatsoever for The Wall Street Journal. I don't think they know what they're doing.""They have taken me on so much it's so ridiculous. Every day, editorials, bad editorials, and they had a poll come out, which was so wrong. I said they should fire their pollster and they should fire their editorial staff because I think these are people that don't know what they're doing.""I don't even want to read it very much anymore. They're so wrong.""So Mr. Trump shouldn't have to release his tax returns because he says The Wall Street Journal doesn't like him. The truth is we cover him like any other politician, and we defended him against the pope and Ted Cruz. This is the second time he's called on us to be fired, which are moments we'll always treasure. The first time he also threatened to sue us if we didn't apologize for noting his lack of trade knowledge; we didn't apologize.Back to Mr. Trump: ""But if you look at their polls that they came out with one day and two days, two polls before the election, they turned out to be so wrong that they should honestly they should fire their pollster. So I don't care what The Wall Street Journal says, what they say doesn't -- and, in fact, if anything, I would do the opposite because then it'll turn out to be more correct.""Our editorial board has nothing to do with the WSJ/NBC/Marist polls, and sometimes polls are wrong, but by now all his listeners heard is that the newspaper must be biased against him. Mr. Stephanopoulos tries again: ""So no release before you're a nominee?""Mr. Trump: ""No, at some point. Well, they'll talk about it. At some point we'll release. There's no rush. Why is there such a rush? I'm supposed to rush like crazy?""By the way, I released my financial statements which are much more important. I released my financial statements and everybody was amazed at how big and how great the company is, much bigger than they thought and it's a great company. Very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some of the best assets in the world.""And I say that only because that's the kind of thinking the United States needs now because our country is in financial trouble and military trouble. We're in every kind of trouble you can have. Our country's a mess. We're going to strengthen the border. We're going to do all of the things that you and I have been talking about for a long time now, George. And it's going to be great.""Mr. Stephanopoulos: ""Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us this morning.""What a performance. Mr. Trump says he doesn't have to release his tax returns because his business is fabulous, though at some point he may release them, maybe, but there's no rush because, well, he doesn't say, though in January he said ""we're working on that now"" and that they would be ""very beautiful."" In any case he's going to fix the country because he's a business success. By the time Mr. Stephanopoulos surrenders for the next guest, viewers can't remember what the original question was.As we wrote Saturday, Mr. Trump should release his tax returns now to avoid Mitt Romney's mistake of waiting for Democrats to make an issue of it, which they will. As the potential GOP nominee, he also owes the details to Republicans so they know as much as they can about the man who would be President. Is there something in those tax returns you want to hide, Mr. Trump?(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Doesn't Take Long to Release a Filed Return"" -- WSJ Mar. 1, 2016)",3/25/16
Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: How Trump's Army Is Transforming the GOP,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767266166?accountid=12768,"Amid all the odd changes unfolding in this election cycle, the most startling may be the way the Republican Party is transforming right before our eyes.Whether Donald Trump is responsible for this transformation, or merely the beneficiary of it, is a chicken-and-egg question for history to decide. But the change now has been unleashed regardless of his electoral fate.Through balloting in three states, it appears that a new set of voters is driving the GOP now. Their agenda is more populist and less ideological than has been the case for Republican voters in the past. They are prepared to break with the party's traditional positions on a number of fronts, particularly on issues important to the Republicans' core business constituency. They have little respect, and to some degree outright antipathy, for the party's leaders.Some of these voters appear new to the GOP, but many have been bouncing around in the party, lured in over the years by their differences with Democrats on cultural issues. The difference now is that they are energized, as opposed to apathetic, and united behind a single candidate. They are driving the primary process and changingthe party in the process.The voters Mr. Trump has pulled together in winning New Hampshire and South Carolina and coming in second in Iowa is a coalition of the economically and culturally alienated, voters who look angry but also a bit frightened. It is a far cry from the traditional GOP winners' coalition.In each of the first three states that have voted, Mr. Trump has carried by a wide margin Republican voters with a high-school education or less, according to polls of voters. In New Hampshire, he won almost half of such voters. In South Carolina, he also won 40% of those with some college education but not a college degree.He also has won in each of the first three states among ideologically moderate Republicans and among those who consider themselves politically independent. He does better among older voters than younger ones; in both New Hampshire and South Carolina, he won among those age 65 and older. He does better among those on the lower half of the income scale than those on the upper half.It's important to note that Mr. Trump is drawing votes from across a broad spectrum of Republican voters; he fishes in every pond. But his core voters are in this new populist alignment.To some extent, the Trump core looks like the voters who propelled Pat Buchanan, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum in earlier Republican election cycles. But not exactly: Their coalitions were more heavily tinged with evangelical voters, who are part of but not the heart of the Trump crowd. And those earlier contenders eventually became marginal candidates, not front-runners.To some extent, this coalition also is a descendant of the tea-party movement that sprang to life in 2010, largely in response to the health-care law of President Barack Obama and his Democratic Party. Yet this coalition is different from that as well. Tea-party adherents were, by and large, ideologically conservative. The Trump coalition isn't conservative in the traditional sense, or ideological at all.This isn't the country club, Wall Street,Chamber of Commerce or religious-conservative set within the GOP. It isn't the deficit-hawk coalition, either, for Mr. Trump has proposed a tax plan that, according to outside analysts, would blow the biggest hole in the side of the budget. And he's the GOP candidate most outspoken about not cutting benefits for Medicare and Social Security recipients.Nor is this the coalition of neoconservatives on security policy, for Mr. Trump has blasted the Iraq war those neocons inspired, and has kind words to say about Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader they abhor.Ronald Reagan used to define the Republican Party as a three-legged stool made up of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives and national-security conservatives.The Trump coalition isn't precisely any of those three.This is a populist coalition, and Mr. Trump has won its support in part by breaking defiantly with traditional Republican economic policies. He mocks free-trade agreements that have had broad support within the party, and particularly within its normally powerful business wing. He has shredded the more open Reagan philosophy on immigration. He can sound more like a Democratic populist than a Republican one when talking about taxing hedge funds and private-equity firms.He has openly ridiculed the last three presidential contenders of the Republican Party: Sen. John McCain, former President George W. Bush and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. He is critical of his party's leaders in Congress and mocks his party's donor base.The voters drawn to these apostasies have moved from the GOP fringes to its heart -- and other candidates trying to catch Mr. Trump ignore them at their peril.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Trump Is Overruning the Republican Party"" -- WSJ Feb. 29, 2016)Credit: By Gerald F.

Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican presidential primaries have seized on the controversy in recent weeks.The woman, Tarla Makaeff, filed the lawsuit in 2010, claiming that Trump University defrauded students around the country and made false promises about helping them achieve financial success.A separate fraud lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against the now-defunct Trump University, seeking $40 million, is also pending .Lawyers for Mr. Trump have denied the allegations.Ms. Makaeff asked U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego to leave the lawsuit as a named plaintiff, saying Mr. Trump and his lawyers have used the perch of his candidacy to publicly demean her .Judge Curiel said he would grant her request, on the condition that lawyers for Mr. Trump be allowed to depose another plaintiff in the case. The judge also permitted lawyers for Trump University to introduce Ms. Makaeff's deposition testimony if the case goes to trial.Ms. Makaeff could still benefit if the remaining plaintiffs win, as a member of a class of people who attended Trump University workshops.Lawyers for Ms. Makaeff and the other plaintiffs declined to comment.""Neither pundits, counsel, or the parties anticipated the media obsession that this case would create due to Defendant Trump becoming a candidate for President of the United States,"" Judge Curiel wrote in his March 21 order.

An appeals court ultimately dismissed the defamation claim, ordering Mr. Trump to pay her just under $800,000 for legal fees.Mr. Trump has decried Ms. Makaeff at rallies, and he tweeted earlier this month, ""The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!""In 2008, Ms. Makaeff attended one of Trump University's three-day workshops called ""Fast Track to Foreclosure"" and then signed up for a ""Trump Gold Elite"" program, which allowed her to attend additional workshops. In total, she said she spent $60,000 in Trump University fees.Mr. Trump's lawyers said Ms. Makaeff's failure to achieve success in real estate wasn't the fault of Trump University.Judge Curiel gave lawyers for the plaintiffs seven days to decide whether to accept the conditions.Write to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.comCredit: By Joe Palazzolo",3/29/16
Still Time for a Conservative Independent; Anti-Trump forces need a convention strategy plus a plan to get ballot access.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774983461?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's disturbingly isolationist remarks to the Washington Post's editorial board this week have fortified the determination of many Republicans to find a viable alternative--at their convention if possible, through an independent conservative candidacy if necessary.Some observers may believe that such a candidate couldn't even get on the ballot because the filing deadlines have come and gone. If so, they are wrong. Back in 1980, from a standing start in late April, Republican John Anderson's underfunded independent presidential campaign managed to get on the ballot in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia by mid-September.As Richard Winger, the publisher of Ballot Access News, has reminded me, the laws in 1980 were less hospitable to independent candidacies than they are today. The reason: The Anderson campaign was determined to leave a legacy of lowered barriers to the ballot for future candidates, so the campaign pursued the issue all the way to the Supreme Court, and Mr. Anderson prevailed. In 1983's Anderson v. Celebrezze, the court held that Ohio's early deadline for independent candidacies to file nominating petitions with the required number of signatures violated the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of association.Anderson v. Celebreeze remains a binding holding today, and it has had an impact. Mr. Winger points out that lower courts have used it to strike down June filing deadlines in five states--Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, Arizona and Kansas.As matters now stand, most states' deadlines are months away. Nine fall in July, 32 in August, and five in September. Four deadlines--Illinois, Indiana, New Mexico and North Carolina--are in June, and precedent suggests that the deadlines would be struck down if challenged.That leaves Texas, the only state with a May filing requirement. Texas has never been taken to court over this, but it seems clear that its law would not survive a challenge. Among other vulnerabilities, Texas imposes an earlier deadline on independent presidential candidates than on aspirants for any other office.This flies in the teeth of the Supreme Court's opinion, which found that state-imposed restrictions on presidential elections affect a ""uniquely important national interest."" Moreover, said the court, a state has a ""less important interest in regulating Presidential elections than statewide or local elections."" It is hard to see how a more stringent requirement for presidential candidates than for others could be squared with the court's reasoning.Not only is there plenty of time remaining for independent candidates to file, but the threshold that ballot petitions must meet is far from onerous.Thirty-four states require fewer than 10,000 signatures, and only two (Florida and California) demand more than 100,000. Moreover, some states make ballot access easier for minor parties than for independent candidates; others do the opposite.In Florida, for example, an independent candidacy would take about 119,000 signatures to get on the ballot; an organized minor party, none whatever.A systematic effort to get on the ballot everywhere would be free to choose its approach, state by state. A well-organized and funded effort could get the job done in a matter of weeks.This is not to say that Republicans who cannot accept a choice restricted to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will have a smooth path. The Republican National Committee is understandably opposed to the idea of an independent candidacy. Months ago, every candidate in the race for the nomination pledged to support their party's nominee, which would make it impossible for any of them to run as an independent conservative without fatally undermining his or her credibility. Other individuals who step forward will probably burn their bridges with the Republican Party, at least as it now stands.And there is a delicate timing issue. It isn't too late right now to mount an independent candidacy, but it will be when the Republican Convention convenes in late July. So this venture would have to be launched well before the identity of the party's nominee is known. The trick for the anti-Trump forces is to proceed simultaneously along two tracks without allowing Plan B to fatally weaken the effort to deny the New York billionaire a first-ballot victory.The most obvious objection to this course has nothing to do with the technicalities of ballot access. An independent conservative candidate who earned even 5% of the popular vote would doom the Republican nominee to defeat in November. The supporters of an independent effort would be compelled to press the case that Mr. Trump cannot win anyway and also would bring down the party's Senate majority--and perhaps the House as well, if the margin of defeat were large. The independent candidate might bring out enough traditional Republicans to save their congressional majorities.A more principled argument--albeit a harder sell for many loyal Republicans--is that Mr. Trump's victory would spell catastrophe, not only for their party, but for the country.Credit: By William A.

Christie Faces Ire at Home --- Out-of-state pitches for Trump spur calls from critics to resign; governor stands firm,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769887107?accountid=12768,"The collapse of Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign fueled hope he would return his attention to New Jersey, but his continued march across the national stage has rekindled criticism that he is shirking responsibilities at home.Mr. Christie endorsed former rival Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, for president on Friday, a surprise move that brought him back to the campaign circuit and national television. On Tuesday, Mr. Christie attracted widespread attention as he stood behind Mr. Trump, staring blankly, during the front-runner's victory speech in Florida.In New Jersey some of Mr. Christie's harshest critics have called on him to resign, and others are talking about a recall effort. A new poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind on Wednesday showed 61% of registered voters disapproved of Mr. Christie's job performance.Some members of the governor's own party who were previously loyal to him said Wednesday that Mr. Christie should resign if he continues to campaign for Mr. Trump.""There's a lot of work to be done in New Jersey,"" said state Sen. Jennifer Beck, a Republican from Monmouth County. ""I think the governor needs to pick where he's going to spend his time.""Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat, said the governor has abandoned the state.""I think he should resign,"" said Ms. Weinberg, adding that she believes a recall effort would be too difficult and distracting. ""Whether there are grounds for impeachment because of dereliction of duty -- maybe that's an alternative.""Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for Mr. Christie, declined to comment on calls for the governor's resignation or discussion of a recall. He didn't comment on Ms. Weinberg's impeachment proposal.""The governor always has balanced out-of-state political activity with his duties as governor,"" Mr. Roberts said. ""That will remain the case moving forward.""During his monthly call-in radio program Monday, Mr. Christie said he would be spending much more time in the state and was focused on New Jersey affairs. ""This is where I've been every day,"" he said.Mr. Christie spent 261 partial or full days traveling outside of New Jersey in 2015, or 72% of the year, according to administration figures. Critics have said the governor has allowed problems -- ranging from worker pensions to the near-bankrupt state transportation fund -- to pile up in Trenton.Since his endorsement of Mr. Trump on Friday, Mr. Christie has introduced Mr. Trump at three campaign events in three states.Mr. Christie traveled on Mr. Trump's plane for the events, and his expenses were picked up by the campaign, said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's campaign manager.The governor's security detail travels with him at all times and will continue to do so for campaign events, following state policy, Mr. Roberts said.In 2012, when Mr. Christie was traveling as a surrogate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Mr. Christie's security cost $260,000, state records show. Taxpayers routinely pay for security for governors.Mr. Christie has nearly two years left in office and can't run for re-election because of term-limits. To launch a recall effort, 25% of the state's registered voters, or 1.4 million people, would need to sign a petition to force a recall election, according to the state constitution.Six Gannett-owned New Jersey newspapers penned a joint editorial Tuesday urging a recall vote if the governor declines to resign. Some of the papers have written critical editorials of Mr. Christie in the past.John Currie, chairman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, said a recall effort ""may be the only recourse New Jersey has for holding our absentee governor to account.""Sam Raia, chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee, said state Democrats should stop playing games.""It's time for Trenton Democrats to take a break from their tired and divisive rhetoric and answer the governor's call for bipartisan solutions,"" he said.The governor has weathered worse political storms, such as the George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal in 2013, and will probably survive this one, said Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University.""The reality is, if it were easy it would have been done during Bridgegate,"" Ms. Harrison said of a recall effort.Still, Mr. Christie faces an uphill battle advancing his agenda. Democrats who control the Legislature said they have grown tired of Mr. Christie's travels out of state, and his endorsement of Mr. Trump poured fuel on the fire. ""He is apparently becoming Donald Trump's opening act, which takes away from us here and the things we need to focus on,"" said Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto.Carl Golden, a former aide to Republican Gov. Tom Kean, said the endorsement is overshadowing Mr. Christie's moves currently, but getting out behind a front-runner early has political advantages.""If you look at it from Christie's point of view, if he was going to endorse somebody, he did it the right way,"" he said.Credit: By Heather Haddon and Kate King",3/29/16
Trump's Pottery Barn GOP,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769886980?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump claims to have opposed the Iraq war before opposition was fashionable. So perhaps he won't mind if we apply Colin Powell's adaptation of the Pottery Barn rule to Mr. Trump's attempted takeover of the Republican Party: If you break it, you bought it.The rule comes to mind after examining the paradox of Super Tuesday's primary results: Mr. Trump was the clear winner and his support is solidifying, but Republican resistance to his candidacy is mounting at the same time. A front-runner at this stage of the primaries would normally be expanding and consolidating his party support, as Hillary Clinton is among Democrats. This is what happened in every other recent GOP presidential race.Mr. Trump is winning, but his Super Tuesday performance was less than commanding. He generally underperformed his percentages in the pre-election polls, and he cracked the 40% mark in only two states -- Massachusetts and Alabama. Overall he averaged about 35% of the vote, lower than his totals in Nevada and about what he received in New Hampshire. Yet the same media sages who said he could never win now say the race is over.One possible explanation is that the attacks on Mr. Trump that began in earnest only late last week have begun to break through to voters. In two of Mr. Trump's weakest states, Oklahoma (28% and second place) and Arkansas (33% and a narrow first), the Club for Growth ran ads against him.Those two states were also so-called closed primaries in which only declared Republicans can vote. Mr. Trump has done better in open primaries in which independents can cast ballots. This matters for closed-ballot contests in the next week, such as Michigan on March 8. The New Yorker also does worse in caucuses, losing to Marco Rubio in Minnesota on Tuesday, and Kansas and Kentucky will hold caucuses Saturday.All of which means that Mr. Trump can still be denied the nomination if enough Republicans mobilize against him. The businessman won some 237 delegates to bring his total to about 319, or a little more than 25% of the way to the nomination. His competitors must still beat him in the large winner-take-all states, which is a tall task, but if they do they could block him from gaining a majority before the GOP convention. Then anything could happen.This will require continued pounding on Mr. Trump from all of the remaining candidates, including John Kasich, who seems to think he can win the nomination as a conscientious objector.By campaigning in Virginia where he had no chance of winning, the Ohio Governor received some 96,500 votes or a mere 9.4%. But that was enough to deny the state to Mr. Rubio, who took 32% but lost to Mr. Trump by about 29,000 votes. Mr. Kasich would be helped in winner-take-all Ohio on March 15 if Mr. Rubio now stayed out of the state, but Mr. Kasich's Virginia move didn't earn him any forbearance.If Mr. Kasich is going to justify staying in the race, he at least has to join Mr. Rubio and Ted Cruz in educating voters about the ways that Democrats will carve up Mr. Trump in the general election. How about joining the calls for the billionaire to release his tax returns? Mr. Trump keeps stonewalling, which by now suggests that his returns contain something that could cost him the nomination. Democrats and the media will pound Mr. Trump to release his returns only after he's nominated.The GOP resistance to his candidacy will be a major problem if Mr. Trump does win the nomination. In the Virginia exit polls, no less than 54% said they would not be ""satisfied"" if Mr. Trump is the party's nominee. That's an astonishing figure in a swing state that a GOP candidate must win in November. The figure was 38% for Mr. Rubio.All of this suggests that Mr. Trump is winning by fracturing the GOP rather than persuading it. Already thoughtful conservatives like Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Wisconsin Rep. Reid Ribble have said they cannot vote for Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sasse is a freshman Senator who ran as an outsider himself. He is no establishment factotum.Mr. Trump dismissed Mr. Sasse's declaration on Tuesday night as unimportant, but that's a mistake. The public defection signals widespread dismay across the GOP about having to vote for a standard bearer who has few political convictions and has scorched so much earth on his way to the nomination.Mr. Trump is aware of his problem because he was at pains to call himself ""a unifier"" on Tuesday night. But asked about working with Congress, Mr. Trump couldn't resist a threat: ""I'm going to get along great with Congress, OK? [House Speaker] Paul Ryan, I don't know him well, but I'm sure I'm going to get along great with him, and if I don't? He's gonna have to pay a big price, OK?""Not OK if Mr. Trump wants to have any hope of assembling a winning GOP coalition that he is doing so much to split apart.",3/29/16
Trump's Blueprint: His Own Book,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769886911?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, who emerged from the Super Tuesday presidential primaries in a commanding position, reached this point by mixing bluff and bluster, by cajoling allies and intimidating opponents, and by being alternately tough, sensational and flattering.He has, in short, handled the presidential campaign as if he were negotiating a deal.The blueprint has been hiding in plain sight all along, say those who know Mr. Trump best.""The Art of the Deal,"" the best-selling book he wrote in a quite different context almost three decades ago, lays out many elements of his unorthodox effort.The book's 11 tenets include advising negotiators to find ways to ""get the word out"" about their position -- and ""the more sensational, the better."" One key strategy is to ""fight back,"" and to do so ""very hard"" against ""losers."" The successful negotiator needs to ""think big.""Mr. Trump acknowledges the parallels. ""This is the biggest deal of my life,"" he said in an interview. ""I've done big deals, but this is a very complex series of deals that ultimately hopefully gets us to the right place to make America great again."" The book's lessons are ""there psychologically"" for him, he said. ""It's automatic.""Mr. Trump's unconventional approach has yielded a string of primary victories that have shaken the Republican establishment and left opponents struggling to devise ways to counter him. As much as his deal-making approach contains the seeds to his success, opponents also are looking to it for grounds to attack him. His frequent references to negotiating have prompted some conservatives to openly question his fealty to their core principles.Many Republican leaders strongly oppose Mr. Trump, who has broken with party orthodoxy on issues as diverse as trade and national security, and some have vowed they won't support him if he wins the party's nomination. An anti-Trump advertising campaign, funded by a few big donors, is gearing up.And though Mr. Trump won the majority of states in Tuesday's voting, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took his home state, Oklahoma and Alaska, and has begun a push to consolidate the anti-Trump vote.Mr. Cruz, in fact, is trying to use Mr. Trump's history as a deal-maker against him. Though Mr. Trump has said his ability to negotiate ensures he will be able to deal successfully with Congress and strike tougher bargains with other countries, Mr. Cruz says Mr. Trump is too inclined to negotiate.Mr. Trump ""is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington,"" Mr. Cruz said at the latest GOP debate in Houston last week. Critical of his opponent's contributions to Democratic lawmakers and past liberal positions, Mr. Cruz, who is currently second in the delegate count, distinguishes himself as ""a proven conservative.""Mr. Trump's campaign-as-negotiation is about to enter a new phase as he launches a charm offensive to win over skeptical party officials. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said the campaign began Tuesday night by reaching out to senior Republican leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.There has never been a modern presidential candidate quite like Mr. Trump, and certainly not one in recent years who has leaned as hard on his business success as the rationale for his quest for the nation's highest political office.Mr. Trump has been able to tap into a large chunk of Republican primary voters so alienated from professional politicians they are prepared to go in a radically different direction. Even Mr. Trump acknowledges he didn't expect his effort to unfold as it has.""I didn't know I'd be doing this well, in all fairness,"" he said. ""I never thought I'd be this far out in the lead. I thought I'd be somewhere in the middle of the pack and edge it out.""A look at how Mr. Trump arrived at this point shows parallels between his campaign efforts and his writings in ""The Art of the Deal."" His son Eric said that many of the book's principles are at work on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump's communications director, Hope Hicks, has read the book three times since she was hired.The parallels start on the book's first page. ""Most people are surprised by the way I work,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""I play it very loose.""That is the style in which his campaign was launched last June. Mr. Trump descended an escalator at his Trump Tower skyscraper to announce his candidacy. Without reading from a text or notes, he stunned the political world by describing illegal immigrants from Mexico as rapists, drug dealers and murderers.Early in his book, Mr. Trump describes 11 ""elements of the deal."" They include:'Think Big'With that adage in mind, Mr. Lewandowski said, Mr. Trump from the outset decided not to pursue ""a one- or two-state strategy,"" but to mount a national campaign.""You have to win them all,"" Mr. Trump said in the interview. ""It doesn't help to win one or two.""The think-big philosophy led Mr. Trump to quickly adopt positions that produced shock and outrage. He created a firestorm by suggesting that the U.S. temporarily ban Muslims after the Paris and San Bernardino terrorist attacks.'Know Your Market'Mr. Trump viewed the electorate as a target market, and he concluded voters were angry, antiestablishment, frustrated with Washington's gridlock and fed up with what they perceived as weakness at home and abroad. He didn't see that market as narrow or made up of niches, but broad, he said.""My market is the people in the country who want to see America be great again,"" he said. ""It's very simple. That's a lot of people. That's not broken down by age, or race or anything.""'Enhance Location'Early trips to Iowa and New Hampshire showed that his celebrity status enabled him to draw larger crowds than other candidates did in traditional house parties. An early event at the home of New Hampshire state Rep. Stephen Stepanek produced a crowd that threatened the stability of the floors. After that, the campaign sought big spaces.The effort was criticized as a move away from the traditional cozy settings for New Hampshire political gatherings, but it attracted bigger crowds, which brought more media coverage. ""Enhancing location brought enhanced benefits,"" Mr. Lewandowski said.'Get the Word Out'In the book, Mr. Trump advised: ""If you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you.""That is what happened when Mr. Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S., and when he questioned whether former GOP presidential candidate John McCain was a war hero because he was captured. Mr. Trump's controversial statements dominated news coverage for weeks, prompting pundits and politicians to predict his demise. Instead, his poll numbers rose.He also adopted another powerful weapon for getting his word out: Twitter. Mr. Trump tweeted early, late and often. ""Some people don't like the idea that you use Twitter and you're running for president,"" said Mr. Trump, who doesn't use a computer, but tweets from his phone. ""Those people are backward.""Through his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, the Trump campaign is followed by nearly 14 million people. The campaign has more than 50 million ""engagements"" on Facebook, said campaign social-media director Daniel Scavino.'Contain the Costs'Access to so many potential supporters through social media and data obtained from rally attendees helped the Trump campaign meet this tenet. A few weeks ago, the campaign began posting a five-digit number on Mr. Trump's podium for supporters to get the latest news. ""It costs us zero, and we've gotten one million inbound texts,"" Mr. Lewandowski said, making it unnecessary to buy databases to connect with voters.Mr. Trump also pays no money for his own pollsters, the cost-saving measure of which he is proud.'Fight Back'This may be the ""Art of the Deal"" advice Mr. Trump has followed most assiduously. Mr. Trump openly proclaimed he would hit back if hit, and hard. From the start, Mr. Trump skewered the other candidates, especially former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whom he repeatedly called ""low energy.""More recently, his opponents have hit back.Sen. Marco Rubio has called Mr. Trump a ""con artist"" who may have ""wet his pants."" Mr. Trump shot back that ""little Marco"" is a ""lightweight"" ""choker"" with ""big ears.""Fighting back is a must, in the deal blueprint and in the campaign, Mr. Trump said. ""I don't like it, but I have no choice,"" he said. ""I watch people say Trump shouldn't do it because he's the front-runner, but when somebody attacks you, you have to.""'Have Fun'This is the final element of deal-making, Mr. Trump said, and something he is doing in the campaign, even in long rope lines after events when he shakes hands and poses for selfies.Many supporters are fans of his book. Jeff Washenberger, 57 years old, of Salem, Va., said he read ""The Art of the Deal"" and found it useful for running the motel and rental properties he owns. He said he believes Mr. Trump will bring his ""deal-making forte to the White House.""After a Trump rallyMondayin Radford, Va., several supporters held up ""The Art of the Deal,"" which Mr. Trump delights in signing.""They know 'The Art of the Deal,' probably the No. 1 business book of all time,"" Mr. Trump said.Credit: By Monica Langley",3/29/16
Next for Trump: A Golf Tournament --- His political ambitions have complicated the front-runner's relationship with the sport of golf,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769886815?accountid=12768,"Following his triumphant performance in the Super Tuesday primaries, Donald Trump got on the phone with a journalist Wednesday to talk about golf.That may sound unusual for a front-running presidential candidate. But this week, the Trump National Doral Resort is hosting the WGC-Cadillac Championship. An annual stop on the PGA Tour, the tournament has become an accidental political event thanks to the White House ambitions of the resort's owner.Since Trump took over the Doral Resort four years ago, he has been a grandstanding presence at the PGA Tour's annual stop there. Typically he touches down in a Trump-emblazoned helicopter near the ninth hole.In the interview on Wednesday, Trump said he would attend the event only on Sunday and that he wasn't sure about arriving in a helicopter.Security is one concern. Another is that he doesn't want his larger-than-ever presence to disrupt the world's top golf pros.It's also the case that Trump's relationship with the sport of golf has become more complicated because of controversial comments he has made on the campaign trail, particularly about immigrants.In December, the Tour said it would reassess its 53-year relationship with Doral after this year, possibly moving the tournament elsewhere. ""Mr. Trump's comments are inconsistent with our strong commitment to an inclusive and welcoming environment in the game of golf,"" the Tour's statement said.Last summer, the Tour and golf's three other major governing bodies in the U. S. -- the U.S. Golf Association, the PGA of America and the LPGA -- issued a joint statement that similarly distanced themselves from his remarks about immigration.Asked on Wednesday whether he understood why those organizations felt compelled to issue that statement, Trump paused for an unusually long time. ""I have a very good relationship with the governing bodies. I've done a good job and I think they appreciate it. I like the people and I want them to do what's good for them, not necessarily what's good for me,"" he said.Then there is the matter of the PGA of America canceling its 2015 PGA Grand Slam of Golf event played at a Trump course in California.With regard to the cancellation of that event, Trump said he released the PGA of America from its contract because the event, a two-day exhibition with each year's major winners or their substitutes, didn't much matter to him.As for future events scheduled to take place on Trump-owned properties, such as future WGC events at Doral, next year's U.S. Women's Open in New Jersey and the Senior PGA Championship outside Washington, D.C., Trump took a tougher if somewhat ambiguous stance.""Just so you'll understand, I have contracts and I'm very good with contracts,"" he said. ""They sat down, they signed contracts, binding contracts, totally binding contracts. Including with Doral, just so you understand. That being said, I like people to be happy and I have great relationships. But I do have contracts.""A spokesman for the PGA Tour on Wednesday said it would not discuss the future of the Doral tournament until after this week's event. The USGA in a statement Wednesday said that although Mr. Trump's views on immigrants were ""inconsistent with our strong commitment to an inclusive and welcoming environment in the game of golf,"" it hasn't changed its plans to stage the 2017 U.S. Women's Open at Trump's Bedminster New Jersey course. As for the Senior PGA Championship, a PGA of America spokesman said, ""We are continuing to monitor developments, but have no other update to offer.""Trump himself has mostly checked out of golf since the campaign got hot and heavy. He last played a month ago at his West Palm Beach, Fla., course, and he has no specific plans to play again soon.""I love golf, but let me tell you. when you finish making a speech in front of 25,000 people, you're not in any mood to play golf. It's a completely different mind-set. My primary focus is (politics) now,"" he said.If he is elected president, he said he would probably play some -- ""More than I'm playing now!"" -- but not nearly as much as he would like to. ""I would use golf mostly to get to know people. You develop relationships on a golf course that are far better than you can develop over lunch or dinner or any other way,"" he said.Having a golf-lover in the White House would be good for the game, Trump said. Asked whether his association with golf has helped or hurt his campaign, since some of his populist supporters might regard the game as elitist, Trump said it was neutral.""Nobody has said that because I have golf courses, that's a negative politically. I have never heard that,"" he said.There's no questioning his competitiveness. ""I had a good night last night,"" he said. ""A lot of winning.""Credit: By John Paul Newport",3/29/16
"Election 2016: Trump's Run Was Years in Making --- GOP front-runner trademarked slogan in 2012, hinted at interest to Oprah in 1988",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769886787?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and a small team of confidants began planning his White House bid just weeks after Mitt Romney's 2012 loss to President Barack Obama.The businessman trademarked his ""Make America Great Again"" slogan in November 2012, according to federal records. He spoke about the dangers of illegal immigration at the Conservative Action Political Conference in 2013, and campaigned in 2014 for Republican Rep. Steve King in Iowa, home of the first contest in the presidential nomination process.Between 2012 and his campaign launch last June, Mr. Trump gave more than $1 million to GOP candidates, super PACs and groups such as the Republican Governors Association, records show. He declined to renew his contract to host ""The Apprentice"" in early 2015.Establishment Republicans have watched the rise of Mr. Trump's bid this year with shock. And yet, Mr. Trump has been telegraphing his presidential ambitions for decades, including when the ever-confident businessman told Oprah Winfrey in 1988 that he would probably win the presidency if he ever competed for it.""I don't think people realized he has always had presidential aspirations,"" said Sam Nunberg, a Republican strategist who advised Mr. Trump from 2013 until last August. ""He knows the voters he attracts. He knew it from the beginning.""Mr. Trump first explored a presidential bid as a Reform Party candidate in 2000. Although he withdrew from the race, he won the party's California primary, and his supporters amassed scrapbooks of newspaper clippings from the effort.In the following years, he hosted ""The Apprentice,"" gave paid speeches and built up his brand. He also grew increasingly frustrated with the direction of the country and its leadership.Despite his endorsement of Mr. Romney in 2012, he came to view him as a weak candidate and was disappointed by his own understated surrogacy role, his advisers at the time said.As 2016 approached, Mr. Trump's children, particularly his daughter, had taken over the management of an increasing share of his corporate dealings. Some of his new investments -- such as the Doral Miami golf resort and Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington, D.C. -- were well in the works.Accustomed to playing a hands-on role in his company, Mr. Trump was looking for another challenge.""This was another mountain to climb. How many great hotels, great buildings and great golf courses can you build?"" said Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump who no longer works for the campaign but remains supportive of it.When New York allies tried to draft him to run for governor, he demurred. ""I have much bigger plans in mind -- stay tuned, will happen!"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter in March 2014.Mr. Trump and his advisers knew that his celebrity was key to a successful presidential campaign, and his June announcement was designed around his sense of showmanship. The kickoff featured Mr. Trump descending an escalator in marble-clad Trump Tower.""What we've been doing from day one is building something that's much bigger and broader than most people thought and understood,"" said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's campaign manager.The businessman's pledge during his announcement to build a wall along the U.S.'s southern border with Mexico to prevent drug-dealers and ""rapists"" from immigrating was swiftly criticized.Mr. Trump ad-libbed most of his speech, his advisers said, but his wall proposal had been hatched earlier as an idea uniting his role as a builder with a hard-line stance on immigration. ""It was simple, finite,"" Mr. Nunberg said.""He likes that he's making history. His likes that his name is up in lights,"" Mr. Stone sums up. ""And he's having fun.""Credit: By Heather Haddon",3/29/16
"Election 2016: Fight to Be Trump's Only Foe Intensifies --- As Carson departs, Rubio aide's call for Kasich to quit is met with derisive response",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769886683?accountid=12768,"The Republican presidential primary is getting smaller, nastier and more intense amid new attacks on front-runner Donald Trump and fears that he's on the verge of opening an insurmountable lead in the delegate hunt for the nomination.Behind the scenes, Mr. Trump's top aide, Corey Lewandowski, sought to open lines of communications with senior Republicans in Washington while his opponents sought to push each other out of the race.Mr. Trump is now the undisputed front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, with the other remaining campaigns openly labeling themselves as underdogs. Mr. Trump has won 319 delegates so far, to 226 for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, 110 for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and 25 for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.The escalating tension will be on display Thursday in a Detroit debate that comes days before another half dozen primaries and caucuses that represent the waning opportunities to stop or slow Mr. Trump's ascent.The most anticipated primary is in Michigan next Tuesday when 59 delegates will be up for grabs. A candidate must win 1,237 delegates to clinch the GOP nomination.Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has won just 8 delegates, won't join his rivals on the stage in Detroit, he announced Wednesday. ""I do not see a political path forward,"" he said in a statement.The campaigns of Messrs. Rubio and Kasich are trying to shrink the field even further. On a Wednesday call with donors, Mr. Rubio's campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, called Mr. Kasich ""selfish"" for remaining in the race. Mr. Sullivan said Mr. Rubio's donors who know Mr. Kasich should contact him and urge him to end his campaign.""No one is doing more to help Donald Trump than John Kasich,"" Mr. Sullivan said, according to details provided by a person on the call. ""He is not getting delegates for himself, just for Trump.""Mr. Kasich's campaign manager, John Weaver, brushed off the suggestion his candidate should drop out. ""Terry can getback to me after Rubio wins Florida,"" Mr. Weaver said. ""Good luck.""The most recent polling shows Mr. Rubio trailing Mr. Trump in Florida by 16 percentage points. Mr. Rubio's aides have guaranteed victory in his home state.Mr. Cruz, who won three states Tuesday, campaigned in Kansas Wednesday, one of three states holding GOP caucuseson Saturday. Louisiana is also holding a primary.Mr. Cruz's performance Tuesday fell short of the high expectations he once had for the March 1 primaries, when he treated the red-state swath as his campaign's ""firewall"" that would guard against runaway losses to his rivals.But the evangelicals and conservative voters who seemed like his natural constituents in the region went to Mr. Trump in numbers unimaginable when the Cruz campaign hatched its strategy months ago.Now the hope for the Cruz campaign lies in upcoming states holding nominating contests closed to anyone who isn't a registered Republican. Mr. Cruz won the primary Tuesday in Oklahoma, which operates by such rules. The senator took 34% in the Sooner State to Mr. Trump's 28%.""We're going to do well on Saturday and Tuesday,"" Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said. ""At midnight on March 15 [after primaries in several states], it will be a two-person race.""The conflict between Rubio and Kasich forces comes amid a broader effort by some Republicans to stop Mr. Trump's momentum a day after he won seven of 11 state contests. The GOP 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, is scheduled to speak on the 2016 primary Thursday at the University of Utah. Mr. Romney won't be endorsing a candidate, an aide said, but he has been a harsh critic of Mr. Trump.Three new TV advertising campaigns -- one from a pro-Rubio super PAC and two from conservative groups that aren't backing any one other candidate -- are seeking to damage Mr. Trump by attacking elements of his business history.The super PAC backing Mr. Rubio is highlighting Mr. Trump's hesitation before disavowing support from former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke during a Sunday CNN interview. In other appearances before and since Mr. Trump has said he doesn't want and rejects KKK support.Our Principles PAC, the stop-Trump group primarily bankrolled by the Ricketts family, is investing in a seven-figure TV ad campaign in Michigan, Illinois and Florida that slams his involvement in Trump University, a now-defunct school that is facing a civil fraud claim in New York.And the Club for Growth is beginning a $1.5 million Florida campaign. The Club was the first third-party group to spend significant sums against Mr. Trump last October, when it invested $1 million in an anti-Trump campaign in Iowa. Mr. Trump lost to Mr. Cruz in those caucuses last month.The Club's new ad, which will air across Florida cable television and online, hits Mr. Trump for his use of eminent domain and bankruptcy filings.Mr. Trump, whose campaign events are regularly carried live on cable television, has yet to purchase any television advertising time in Florida.---Janet Hook and Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

Trump Wins Nevada Vote,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767558418?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump won the Nevada Republican caucuses Tuesday, giving him his third state victory in a row and reinforcing his status as the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination.The outcome, declared by the Associated Press, gives Mr. Trump another blast of momentum heading into the next contest March 1, when 11 states will hold primaries and caucuses, and when more convention delegates will be awarded than on any other primary day of the 2016 calendar.The March 1 Super Tuesday primaries cut deeply through the Bible Belt, featuring many of the most conservative and religious states in the nation.Mr. Trump is leading in polls in nearly all the states voting that day. He is most vulnerable in Texas, where home-state Sen. Ted Cruz is ahead. Since none of the states is winner-take-all, Mr. Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have a chance to pile up delegates under rules that split them proportionally.Mr. Cruz will be working to win the backing of more evangelical Christians after a third-place finish in South Carolina, staff tumult and charges of underhanded campaign tactics. He has invested heavily in these southern states and will be battling Mr. Rubio, who is trying to gather establishment support to emerge as the leading alternative to Mr. Trump.All of the candidates will have to convince voters like Cheryl Teel, a sales consultant for a gift company. ""We were founded on Christian values,"" said Ms. Teel, a 52-year-old Republican from Titus, Ala., near Montgomery, who remains undecided. ""I want them to have a relationship with Jesus Christ.""Mr. Trump rolls into the region having proven in South Carolina -- where he won all 50 delegates -- that many social-conservative voters are eager to embrace him despite his brash, sometimes profane statements.""I'm not looking for a preacher. I'm looking for a man who leads,"" said Bonnie Shanahan, a 72-year-old retiree in Montgomery who admires his business savvy and resoluteness. Though she is evangelical and has knocked on doors to try to enlist new religious adherents, she said she doesn't care whether Mr. Trump can quote the Bible.States voting on March 1 in what has been dubbed the SEC primary after the college-sports conference will award more convention delegates -- 595 -- than on any other single day of the 2016 primary season. In addition to Texas, states awarding delegates include Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Alaska, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Vermont and Virginia.For Mr. Cruz, Texas is a must win, with 155 delegates at stake, more than the first four states combined. Mr. Rubio is looking for fertile ground in the less conservative states such as Virginia and metropolitan areas like Atlanta. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is working Vermont and Massachusetts, neighbors to New Hampshire where he scored a second-place finish.But for everyone, Mr. Trump is the man to beat, and he could crush the rest of the field if his triumphs in South Carolina and New Hampshire are harbingers.The move from the early contests, where candidates had the luxury of campaigning one state at a time, will be a bracing test of their resources and endurance as they compete at a faster pace. ""It's like going from a tricycle to the Daytona 500,"" said Henry Barbour, a Republican lobbyist in Mississippi who recently endorsed Mr. Rubio.Strategy now is more complex because of the states' varying rules for allocating convention delegates to candidates proportionately, setting up some opportunities to scoop up some delegates without finishing first statewide.Mr. Rubio campaigned Tuesday in Minnesota. Mr. Kasich, who barely competed in Nevada, appeared in Virginia on Monday and Georgia on Tuesday. Mr. Trump plans to campaign Friday in Oklahoma. All the candidates gather Thursday in Houston for the next Republican debate.One reminder of how conservative the region is: In 2012, three of the states in the SEC primary went for former Sen. Rick Santorum, a conservative Catholic; in 2008, Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and Southern Baptist minister, captured four.That profile would appear to benefit Mr. Cruz, who has courted evangelical Christians assiduously, but the South Carolina results showed that Mr. Trump has struck a chord with many voters in the South, despite the New York businessman's blustery style. Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Mr. Trump beat Mr. Cruz among evangelical voters, 34%-26%, with Mr. Rubio following with 21%.In Alabama, where evangelical Christians made up 80% of the Republican primary voters in 2012, voters like Ms. Teel worry the U.S. has lost its moral compass. She is a devout Southern Baptist and wants to hear how the GOP contenders' religious convictions will shape the way they govern.Among such voters, opposition to gay marriage and abortion is strong. Cheered by some conservatives, Roy Moore, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, fought last year against implementation of the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriages. And the state's abortion clinics have long battled legal efforts to shut them down.In interviews with more than two dozen voters around the state, such issues came up regularly, along with concerns about the economy, immigration and national security.""The Constitution is written on Judeo-Christian laws, the Ten Commandments, which Obama threw out a long time ago,"" Debbie Rangel, a 67-year-old retiree, said at a recent gathering of Republican women in Trussville, near Birmingham. ""I think Cruz will bring us back to that.""Some in the group questioned Mr. Trump's religious conviction and bristled at what they considered his demeanor.""The arrogance that Trump has, the rudeness -- we're just not that way,"" said Sandy Lancaster, a former business instructor who described herself as ""ultraconservative"" on social issues and favors Messrs. Cruz and Rubio.Yet Mr. Trump enjoys strong support among many social and religious conservatives. ""I want somebody that can win,"" said Jeannine Svenson, a retiree in Montgomery, Ala., and a conservative evangelical Christian.The Cruz campaign has organized a coalition of pastors and enlisted captains in Alabama's seven congressional districts and most of its 67 counties, said Alabama co-chairman Ann Eubank.The Rubio team has recruited county leaders as well, and sought to galvanize groups ranging from students to farmers to hunters, said Republican state Rep. Will Ainsworth, a state co-chairman.One recent afternoon at a Trump office in Montgomery, former Republican state Rep. Perry Hooper Jr. was plotting outreach efforts with volunteers when Donica Knight arrived.A country and rock singer whose most recent album is titled ""Can't Buy a Southern Girl,"" Ms. Knight said she was a Trump supporter and planned to write a song about him to perform at campaign events. ""It'll be patriotic,"" she said.---Reid Epstein, Byron Tau and Alexandra Berzon contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook and Arian Campo-Flores",3/29/16
Election 2016: Trump Wins Broad Backing,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767558317?accountid=12768,"LAS VEGAS -- Donald Trump's Nevada victory Tuesday was propelled by support from across the Republican spectrum, with big margins among evangelicals, conservatives, moderates and all age groups surveyed in entrance polls.The Associated Press declared Mr. Trump the winner shortly after 9 p.m. local time, when the caucuses closed. It hadn't yet declared the winner for second place between Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.Mr. Trump won by big margins among both men and women, and led his rivals among all age groups surveyed. He was the top choice for both conservative and moderate voters. He also led his rivals among Republican voters of all education levels -- but drew his highest level of support from caucus-goers with no college degree.Mr. Trump also won pluralities among both white and nonwhite Republican voters, though whites made up 85% of the Republican caucus electorate in Nevada.At a Trump rally Tuesday in Sparks, Nev., Frank Mooney, 69 years old, said he would caucus for Mr. Trump because he found the billionaire ""energetic"" and ""exhilarating.""""He is an outsider, and I think that is his greatest virtue,"" Mr. Mooney said. ""Not since Ross Perot has there been a businessman, who is willing to take on Washington, and that is what we have to have happen.""After winning primary contests in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Mr. Trump barely campaigned ahead of Nevada's caucuses. The New York businessman held just two campaign rallies, while Messrs. Cruz and Rubio crisscrossed the state in advance of Tuesday night's contest.Messrs. Rubio and Cruz also invested heavily in both television advertising and extensive ground operations here. In recent days, Mr. Cruz launched blistering attacks on Mr. Trump for his support of maintaining federal land management in the state. But Mr. Cruz was distracted when he was forced to dump a top aide Monday over the aide's social-media postings.Mr. Rubio sought to remain above the fray, never mentioning his rivals' names during five campaign stops in three days. But to reporters, Mr. Rubio delivered a blistering critique of Mr. Cruz and suggested Mr. Trump hasn't studied up on issues enough to be commander-in-chief.Support for Mr. Trump among Republican voters only appears to be growing, despite an increasing consensus among the party's establishment in favor of Mr. Rubio, and to a lesser extent Mr. Cruz. Elite party opinion quickly coalesced around Mr. Rubio after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ended his presidential bid last weekend.Mr. Rubio announced nearly two dozen new endorsements since Saturday night, including the former presidential candidates Tim Pawlenty and Bob Dole, Sens. Orrin Hatch, Jeff Flake and Dean Heller, as well as four members of the Florida congressional delegation who had previously backed Mr. Bush. Trump supporters gathered Tuesday night at Treasure Island casino on the Las Vegas Strip let out periodic cheers as they watched results come in on television. They lined up through the casino floor and waited in long lines to go up an elevator and head into a ballroom, taxing security efforts and upsetting some of the people trying to get to their rooms.Supporters began a countdown before 9 p.m. and then began cheering loudly as the television stated Mr. Trump had won. Cheers of ""Trump! Trump! Trump"" came through the crowd.Samantha Fenner, a Las Vegas massage therapist who cast her ballot at Bonanza High School in Las Vegas, said she chose Mr. Trump because of his strong stance against illegal immigration. ""I felt strongly that national security is a huge, important issue,"" she said. ""I want people to come legally. We want someone who is sure in that conviction to make that happen.""Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who appeared to place well behind the first three candidates -- and finished fourth in Iowa, eighth in New Hampshire and sixth in South Carolina -- told supporters in Las Vegas that his campaign will continue.Credit: By Reid J.

Trump and the Obama Power Temptation,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761394559?accountid=12768,"Of all the Republicans campaigning in Iowa, perhaps none is campaigning harder than Ben Sasse, a Republican senator from Nebraska. Mr. Sasse isn't running for president. He's running against Donald Trump. The particular focus of his opposition deserves a lot more attention.Mr. Sasse is a notable voice in this debate. He's a heavyweight conservative -- a grass-roots favorite, the furthest thing from the ""establishment."" Before winning his Senate seat in 2014, he had never held elected office. He was the president of Midland University in Fremont, Neb., when he decided that he had to try to get to Washington and help restore the constitutional vision of the Founders.Which is his point in Iowa: ""We have a President who does not believe in executive restraint; we do not need another,"" said Mr. Sasse in a statement announcing that he would campaign with Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and other ""constitutional candidates."" On Twitter, Mr. Sasse issued a string of serious questions for Mr. Trump, including: ""Will you commit to rolling back Exec power & undoing Obama unilateral habit""?That's a good question for every Republican candidate. President Obama has set a new lawless standard for Washington that might prove tempting for his successor from another party. Why suffer Democratic filibusters when you can sign an executive order? Why wait two years for legislation when you can make it happen overnight? The temptation to cut constitutional corners would be powerful given the pent-up conservative desire for a Washington overhaul.Here's another question for the Republican contenders, a corollary to the Sasse challenge: Do you promise to reject dark power?How the candidates answer ought to matter to every conservative voter. For almost a decade conservatives have suffered under a liberal movement that has honed the tactic of deploying government against its political opponents.The Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative nonprofits -- after Mr. Obama and Democrats encouraged the tax agency to act. Prosecutors hostile to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker staged predawn raids on conservative activists, part of a secret John Doe probe into bogus campaign-finance violations. Powerful Democratic senators harassed and intimidated conservatives for giving money to free-market groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council. Democrats singled out conservative donors, who found themselves subject to government audits.The Republican presidential contenders would undoubtedly decry those nefarious acts -- and be offended if asked whether they would do the same. Yet power is seductive, and plenty of voters are angry enough to embrace a ""Republican Obama"" -- that is, someone who would go after their perceived political enemies. Witness the Washington Republicans who last year called on the IRS to hound the Clinton Foundation. Somewhere, Lois Lerner was smiling.Mr. Trump's broadsides are no doubt part of his allure. But how would he conduct himself in a post-Obama White House? Mr. Trump, after all, doesn't merely call out opponents; in this campaign he has threatened individuals and organizations for daring to criticize him. In September he sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Club for Growth, promising a ""multi-million-dollar"" lawsuit if the group didn't stop running ads in Iowa highlighting his tax ideas.In December Mr. Trump's representatives sent a letter threatening litigation to a wealthy Florida businessman, Mike Fernandez, who ran an ad against the candidate in a local newspaper. Another Trump letter threatened to sue a political-action committee backing presidential rival John Kasich. The company StopTrump.us, which was selling anti-Trump merchandise, was another object of Mr. Trump's litigious saber-rattling. He has also threatened lawsuits against newspapers, including this one. Mr. Trump in November threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal if it didn't retract and apologize for an editorial that criticized him for not understanding the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. The Journal refused, and his lawyer withdrew the threat.This follows a lifetime of Mr. Trump's using the judicial branch, or simply the threat of legal action, to try to silence his critics. He (unsuccessfully) sued the author of a book that claimed he wasn't really a billionaire. He (successfully) sued a Miss USA contestant for claiming the pageant process was ""rigged."" He threatened legal action against an activist who had ginned up a campaign to get Macy's to stop selling Trump-branded products (he didn't sue in the end).Sometimes Mr. Trump's legal actions are less about hushing critics than blocking business competition. He sued New York state for letting bars offer a lottery game that might have cut into his casino revenue. He sued New Jersey for funding a tunnel project that would have funneled more people to a rival casino owner's resort.More worrisome is Mr. Trump's willingness to use government to punish a critic. In September on Fox News, National Review's Rich Lowry praised GOP candidate Carly Fiorina by saying that in a debate exchange with Mr. Trump, she had ""cut his balls off with the precision of a surgeon."" Mr. Trump -- who often derides political correctness -- called on the Federal Communications Commission to fine Mr. Lowry.Mr. Trump is a fan of government power generally, as alarmed constitutional conservatives will tell anyone willing to listen. He has never offered deeply considered views about the office of the presidency -- on its obligations, the limits of its power, the need to exercise restraint.""The current administration has resurrected Nixon's weaponization of the bureaucracies against its opponents,"" says Mr. Sasse. ""And I don't have great hope that a guy who brags, 'If someone screws you, screw them back,' is going to return to the rule of law.""Mr. Trump on Friday night last week finally responded, sort of, to Mr. Sasse's tweeted queries. ""@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?"" Mr. Trump tweeted. Mr. Sasse responded: ""Thanks. As the sonuva football &wrestling coach, this is high praise."" Then he went back to prodding Mr. Trump about how he would wield power if elected president.A few of Mr. Trump's GOP rivals, perhaps caught up in the public anger or desperate to catch him in the polls, have also flirted with suggesting that they would govern beyond the law. Maybe that's what some voters want. But as those voters weigh their choices, they might spare five minutes to remember the years-long IRS nightmare suffered by dozens of tea party groups, or the fear that grass-roots conservatives felt as Wisconsin police swept into their homes.Government possesses a terrible power that must be used sparingly. Conservatives should prefer a president who agrees.---Ms. Strassel writes the Journal's Potomac Watch column.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",3/30/16
"The Trump-Sanders China Syndrome; The charge of currency manipulation was always off-base, but now it's starting to look ludicrous.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776469836?accountid=12768,"Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, with a phalanx of lawmakers behind them, continue to bash China as a ""currency manipulator."" Both men claim that Beijing is engaged in a permanent strategy to keep the yuan weak and prop up its trade surplus. But the reality was never that simple, and the charge is ludicrous at present.Beijing began pegging its currency to the U.S. dollar over two decades ago, as part of its plan to integrate the Chinese economy into a global marketplace in which transactions were overwhelmingly priced in dollars. It stuck by this strategy even during the height of the Asian financial crisis, in 1998, when much of the world was expecting it to devalue. This earned it great praise from the U.S. government. ""China, by maintaining its exchange rate policy,"" pronounced President Clinton's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, ""has been an important island of stability in a turbulent region.""But once market pressures reversed, and capital began flowing into China, U.S. lawmakers suddenly decided that currency stability was bad: They wanted the yuan to rise, while China continued to keep it fixed. In a 2006 op-ed for this newspaper, Sens. Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham declared that ""one of the fundamental tenets of free trade is that currencies should float."" Such a tenet, remarkably, was unknown to either Adam Smith or John Maynard Keynes, neither of whom ever supported any such thing.Fast forward to 2016, and capital is now flowing out of China at a prodigious rate. In an effort to slow the resulting fall in its currency, China's central bank has been selling vast amounts of dollars and buying up yuan. At $3.2 trillion, China's reserves still seem enormous. But they are down $790 billion from their 2014 peak, and $325 billion in the past four months.At this pace of decline, China's reserves will fall to $2.8 trillion in July. To put this in perspective, China, using the International Monetary Fund's framework for reserve-adequacy measurement, needs to hold between $2.8 trillion and $4.2 trillion in reserves to safeguard against a balance-of-payments crisis. Once reserves fall below an adequate precautionary level, China is at risk of being unable to pay for essential imports or its dollar debts. The IMF estimate could be overly cautious, given China's relatively low level of external debt, but it could also be too sanguine in that some significant portion of China's reserves, estimated to be around a third, is believed to be tied up in nonliquid assets--and unavailable in a crisis. These include China's capital commitment to the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.So what can China do to stanch the rapid decline in reserves?The country has for years been pursuing what has been called the ""Impossible Trinity"": controlling interest and exchange rates while leaving the capital account significantly open. Chinese residents are permitted to send up to $50,000 overseas annually and this is enough to allow trillions in outflows. China could impose tighter capital controls to prevent this, as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda recently urged it to do. This would allow it to operate safely with fewer reserves. The adequate level of precautionary reserves falls to between $1.7 trillion and $2.6 trillion when adjusted for capital controls. But this would put a halt to China's plans to transform the yuan into a major reserve currency--something it will be reluctant to do.China could also raise interest rates, which might encourage capital inflows and discourage outflows, but this would hurt growth in an already sinking economy.Finally, China could let the exchange rate fall significantly, but this would increase the debt burden on Chinese companies. Outstanding dollar credit to Chinese nonfinancial companies is estimated to be around $1 trillion. Too great a fall in the yuan, coupled with slowing economic growth, could precipitate a corporate solvency crisis.That China has no good options, and only a choice among painful ones, reflects the underlying structural problem in the Chinese economy--one that will take many years to fix. The economy was tooled to support grossly overoptimistic expectations of foreign demand for Chinese exports. Retooling it to encourage domestic demand will require time and a willingness by the Chinese government to allow businesses to die so that more promising ones may live.It also shows that American charges that China's currency was massively undervalued were based on the flawed assumption that capital would want, indefinitely, only to get into China and not out. It's a sure bet no one in Washington will be calling for China to float its currency again anytime soon.Mr. Steil is director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of ""The Battle of Bretton Woods"" (Princeton University Press, 2013).

"Election 2016: GOP Candidates Make Their Final Appeals --- Trump, Cruz exchange barbs while Rubio says he will be a uniter as Iowa caucuses near",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761395409?accountid=12768,"CEDAR FALLS, Iowa -- The crowded Republican presidential race spilled into its final day here with the top-tier candidates making sharply different cases for why each should win the nation's first election contest.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, returning to a theme he used to launch his campaign, promised to expand the party's electorate. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz accused his rivals of being insufficiently conservative. And Donald Trump, the unimaginable GOP front-runner when the campaign began a year ago, promised rallies across the state to ""make America great again"" without offering many specifics.The closing arguments reflected bets on who will decide Iowa's Monday night caucuses -- and what placing first, second or third would mean for each camp.Mr. Rubio, in a town-hall style meeting Sunday afternoon at the University of Northern Iowa, argued he is best equipped to unite the GOP's disparate elements as the party has been split by the anti-establishment campaigns of Messrs. Cruz and Trump.""No one running for president can bring the conservative movement and the Republican Party back together faster than I can,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""We won't just unite this party, we will grow it.""Mr. Cruz closed his Iowa campaign yo-yoing between attacking his two top rivals and offering a strictly positive message about himself. In the campaign's final weeks, the first-term senator diverged from his once-disciplined commitment to avoid attacking other candidates, which endeared him to voters who see in him an alternative to politics as usual.Saturday night in Sioux City, Mr. Cruz went after both of his rivals for their supposed conservative apostasies.""A vote for Rubio is a vote for amnesty"" for illegal immigrants, Mr. Cruz said. ""A vote for Trump is a vote for Obamacare.""Mr. Trump fired repeated barbs at Mr. Cruz while essentially ignoring Mr. Rubio. He campaigned alongside Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., who vouched for the New Yorker's appeal for evangelical voters. In a Sunday TV interview on Fox, Mr. Trump said he would ""strongly consider"" appointing Supreme Court justices who would seek to overturn last year's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.To his crowds, Mr. Trump crowed over the latest polling numbers. In Council Bluffs, he reminded Iowa voters that Monday is their opportunity to ""pick a winner"" -- in a state that hasn't picked the GOP nominee since George W. Bush in 2000.""You have a lousy record, you've gone 16 years without picking a winner,"" Mr. Trump said to a laughing crowd. ""Please, pick a winner,"" he added, pointing to himself.Messrs. Cruz and Trump are each heavily invested in winning Iowa. Mr. Cruz declared himself the front-runner here in January, before Mr. Trump launched attacks on his Canadian birth and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, the state's most popular Republican, said Iowans shouldn't vote for Mr. Cruz because of his opposition to federal ethanol mandates.If Mr. Rubio finishes in second place ahead of either rival, it would be a damaging blow to the candidate coming in third. Rubio aides have publicly played down their own expectations, providing an opening for a surprise finish.One Rubio target, Mike Hammer of Clive, said at Mr. Rubio's Saturday night rally in Urbandale that he remains torn between the Florida senator and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, after previously flirting with Govs. John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin; Mr. Walker ended his campaign in September.""Early on I liked governors,"" said Mr. Hammer, a 56-year-old financial planner. ""Now . . . I want to get the guy who can beat Trump.""Mr. Cruz's success in Iowa will hinge on winning over voters like Scott Hardwick, a landscaper from North Liberty who had been turned from Mr. Trump by his attacks on Mr. Cruz. ""I wasn't anti-Trump until he came down like he did on Ted Cruz,"" said Mr. Hardwick. ""It caused me to eliminate any doubt about who Donald Trump was.""Lower-polling candidates aimed to peel away support from the front-runners.Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul are airing ads attacking Mr. Cruz. And Mr. Christie, with 3% support in the latest Des Moines Register poll, argued Messrs. Rubio and Cruz lack sufficient executive experience to be president and slammed Mr. Trump for being unserious.And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who when the race began was considered a favorite because of his lineage and robust fundraising but is now polling at 2% support, found himself lamenting his inability to attract voters.Credit: By Reid J.

GOP Vote Hinges on Turnout --- Getting out first-time caucus-goers is seen as key to Trump's chances of winning Iowa,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761395155?accountid=12768,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- To pull off a momentum-building win here Monday night, Donald Trump is banking on turnout from people who would be caucusing for the first time, such as Maddie Hiatt.The 20-year-old Drake University student waited in the cold last Thursday to catch a glimpse of the Republican presidential front-runner. She said she definitely plans to caucus for him on Monday.""He's running on his own terms, and he's not backed by big corporations,"" said the sophomore graphic-design major.The most important variable heading into caucus day is how many people will make the trip to their local precinct to vote. That number could prove the difference between a once-improbable win and a disappointing finish by Mr. Trump.Some 39% of likely GOP caucus-goers who haven't turned out in past contests prefer Mr. Trump over his rivals, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll, 10 percentage points higher than the portion of past participants who favor the front-runner. That poll found Mr. Trump leading the GOP field.Sen. Ted Cruz performs just as well among first-time caucus-goers as among Republicans who have turned out in the past, the WSJ/NBC/Marist poll found. Other surveys show him outperforming Mr. Trump among regular participants.""The bigger the turnout, the better it is for Trump,"" said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican.The Democratic race in Iowa features a similar dynamic, with many strategists saying a high turnout would favor Mr. Sanders in his race against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Sanders has made that argument himself. ""My prediction is that if tomorrow night there is a large voter turnout we win,"" he said Sunday in Marshalltown, Iowa.Like Mr. Trump in the Republican race, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders leads among first-time Democratic caucus-goers and lags behind his top rival among those who have previously attended.In the Republican race, internal projections by GOP operatives involved in the race show the prospects of a Trump win improving as the electorate expands above the 120,000-vote range of the past two presidential cycles. But some of those same projections suggest turnout may need to exceed 140,000 voters for Mr. Trump to defeat a Cruz campaign that has focused on caucus-goers who regularly participate in the event.Just under 119,000 Republicans turned out for Iowa's caucuses in 2008, and a record 121,500 caucused in 2012.Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann has suggested as many as 150,000 people could participate, thanks to the exceptionally large field, higher-than-normal interest in the race and, of course, the presence of Mr. Trump.The size of the turnout isn't the only factor that could tip the scales; the makeup of the electorate is also critical. Roughly half of all caucus-goers in 2012 described themselves as ""very conservative,"" and 57% said they were evangelical Christians. But public polls, including the WSJ/NBC/Marist survey, predict a much smaller share of both groups will appear this time around.If that trend holds, Mr. Trump could be in for a big night. He does best among less-conservative voters, while Mr. Cruz, of Texas, outpaces the New York businessman among evangelicals. According to public polls and internal campaign models, the race gets a lot tighter if evangelicals represent a similar share of the caucus-night electorate as they did in 2012.""The Cruz coalition largely consists of Iowans who caucus every four years like it's their job,"" said Matt Strawn, who chaired the Iowa GOP during the 2012 presidential election. ""The power of Iowa's Christian-conservative voting bloc would be diluted if a surge of first-time caucus attendees turn out to support Trump.""But the risk for Mr. Trump is that people who haven't voted before will be put off by the caucus process, which can involve spending hours Monday night listening to political speeches before casting a ballot. One voter attending Mr. Trump's Davenport rally Saturday wasn't sure whether she could vote that night.""Is this the caucus?"" asked Ellen Kine of Davenport, before being reminded that it was just a rally for Mr. Trump.There is little evidence of a big surge in new, Republican voters. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll found that first-timers accounted for 40% of the expected GOP electorateMonday, in line with the 38% of newcomers in 2012.The Register poll in 2008 successfully predicted the surge of new caucus-goers who boosted Barack Obama to victory in the Democratic contest. Nearly 240,000 Democrats showed up that year.The campaigns spent the final weekend before balloting doing everything they could to juice turnout. The Cruz campaign has assembled 12,000 volunteers, making more than 20,000 calls a day to likely caucus-goers and knocking on more than 1,000 doors.""At this point, it is all turnout,"" Mr. Cruz told reporters in Sioux City on Saturday.While the Cruz camp prioritizes traditional caucus-goers, the Trump campaign is particularly focused on voters who attended his rallies or visited his campaign website or Facebook page, Iowa Republicans said. On Saturday night, Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka took to a Facebook video to explain in minute detail how to caucus for her father.Despite his lead in most polls, Mr. Trump remains a polarizing figure among Republicans here. Some regular caucus-goers who had planned to back the billionaire said they were jumping ship in the closing days, with many noting his decision to skip the final candidates' debate last Thursday.""The people of Iowa deserve to hear his closing argument,"" said Bryan Moon, 54, a Republican from West Des Moines who had planned to vote for Mr. Trump.Love him or not, Mr. Trump remains the biggest attraction in the race. Thousands of students and supporters stood outside an auditorium on the Drake campus Thursday night to get a seat for his impromptu fundraiser for veterans after he backed out of the Fox News debate.""I'm not sure I could be this excited about another candidate,"" said Alec Bognor, 18, a Drake student who spoke on Mr. Trump's behalf at the school's mock caucus event. ""I wouldn't sit in line for three hours for Marco Rubio.""---Janet Hook contributed to this article.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",4/4/16
Election 2016: Trump Campaign Makes Last Push,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1761394575?accountid=12768,"DAVENPORT, Iowa -- Furniture sales manager Lee Kerr laughed when the bartender said the crowds coming for a drink after the Donald Trump rally here Saturday were wearing him out.""We got too many Trump people down here who just want to spend money, people who want to put money into the economy!"" bellowed Mr. Kerr, a stout fellow holding a bottle of Bud Light, who said he's a Trump man through-and-through. ""Everything he touches turns to gold!""Mr. Kerr headed to the Me & Billy bar and restaurant rather than the rally in part because he's already made his mind up on who he's going to caucus for Monday, when voting finally begins in the 2016 presidential primary races.He knows where the candidate stands because of the GOP front-runner's personal appearances in the state -- and the controversy and the free media exposure that comes with it. Mr. Kerr has gotten calls from the Trump machine to make sure he turns out for his first-ever caucus.In short, Mr. Kerr is an example of just how unusual the Trump campaign has been. The first-time candidate has broken almost all the political rules, by insulting women, minorities and even Fox News, the media darling for most conservative Republicans.It's another surprising element in the candidacy of Mr. Trump, a reality television star and billionaire businessman-turned-politician. His unorthodox campaign, once dismissed by party insiders as a political folly, has dominated one of the longest and most unpredictable beginnings to a presidential race in modern history. If he wins the GOP nomination, his campaign could fundamentally change both the Republican Party and the way business is conducted on the campaign trail.Mr. Trump's campaign has been calling voters, but those interviewed said they weren't cajoled by campaign representatives to do any volunteering and weren't even helped to find their caucus locations. Campaign workers sometimes work the crowd to get contact information and pass out literature, but not always.In response to a request for the size of Mr. Trump's operation in Iowa, his campaign said, ""Seventeen paid staffers, thousands of volunteers!""Mr. Trump closed his Iowa campaign by covering the state in recent days, using his signature Boeing 757 to make appearances in front of huge crowds in places like Davenport rather than the traditional close-up meetings with voters. He also made whistle stops in places like Dubuque, where he held a rally in a hangar at the regional airport. The plane did a low flyby of the crowd as soaring music played on a public address system before circling back around, landing and pulling right up next to the throng so he had to walk just a few steps to address them.The most recent Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Mr. Trump, with 28% support of likely voters, pulling even further ahead of his closest rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who slid to 23%.His message has remained consistent even in the closing days of the Iowa campaign. Build a wall on the Mexican border, freeze immigration, support gun owners, mock the Iran deal and tout independence from the establishment. His recent courting of evangelicals has also taken more prominence, with Jerry Falwell Jr., Liberty University president, joining him Saturday and Sunday.Mr. Trump added some final flourishes to the usual script to ensure supporters get out to vote. ""It all doesn't matter if you don't caucus on Monday,"" he said at the Davenport rally Saturday. ""The polls don't matter, nothing matters. The only thing that matters is the poll that's going to be taken on Monday.""At a Sunday rally in Council Bluffs he praised Iowans' intellect, telling them, ""People are very smart, they just get it,"" and adding, ""You are going to make a decision soon and we're going to do a hell of a job.""Credit: By Ben Kesling",4/4/16
Election 2016: Voters Question Moves by Trump --- Accusations over Iowa don't sit well with some Republicans in New Hampshire,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762622670?accountid=12768,"EXETER, N.H. -- After a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump has been making accusations and shifting his message and tactics as he tries to regain the title of Republican presidential front-runner.Some of it isn't sitting well with New Hampshire voters just as they are settling on their candidate of choice in next Tuesday's primary.The celebrity businessman has accused the Iowa winner, Ted Cruz, of cheating after the Texas senator's campaign and his supporters incorrectly suggested to voters that retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was quitting the race.""Actually, I think I came in first,"" Mr. Trump said to cheers at a campaign rally in Arkansas on Wednesday night. ""That voter fraud, these politicians are brutal,"" he said.While Mr. Cruz apologized to Mr. Carson, who hasn't suspended his campaign, Mr. Trump's complaints -- and his demand for a do-over in Iowa -- were off-putting to some voters here.""I just think he's being a poor loser,"" said Elizabeth Bavely, a 48-year-old independent from Concord, N.H. ""When it came down to the people in that room, that's what it came down to, and we have to respect that decision,"" she said in a reference to the Iowa caucuses.Dave Connors, 71, of Hampton, N.H., who attended a Cruz event Thursday, said that he and his wife ""were really big Trump supporters, but his lack of filter is really getting to me.""Other voters remained steadfast in their support for Mr. Trump, who continues to lead in New Hampshire polls.Paul Giovannucci, 47, is sticking with Mr. Trump, but said the campaign should move on, and that Mr. Trump's second place was good enough for him. ""I think he did wonderful,"" said Mr. Giovannucci.For those already leaning against Mr. Trump, his reaction to his first political loss only cemented their opinion.""He's used to being in charge all the time. So for him to not be in charge this time, I think it is hard for his ego,"" said Stephanie Bissonnette, 49, a medical worker from Weare, N.H.On Thursday, Mr. Trump eased off his accusations and began shifting his message and tactics. As he started atown-hall event here, he didn't rattle off a series of polls showing him in first place -- even though a recent New Hampshire survey has him ahead.A University of Massachusetts-Lowell/7News survey taken since Iowa's caucuses found that Mr. Trump had 36% of support among GOP primary voters, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 15% and Mr. Cruz at 14%.The poll showed that Mr. Trump's support fell slightly in the days after the caucus votes, but it was within the margin of errorof 3%.Mr. Trump also salted his campaign schedule with the sort of smaller, retail events that he had previously mocked his competitors for holding.The town hall was held at a historic site with room for hundreds of people, not the thousands he has typically drawn to rallies.During it, he added a new issue to his agenda -- using the power of the presidency to negotiate lower drug prices -- and reminded attendees that he isn't beholden to the drug industry because he isn't soliciting campaign donations.After the town hall, Mr. Trump met with supporters at a nearby business for a retail stop that was closed to reporters. He later delivered remarks at a shift change for the Manchester police department.""The police have been so amazing in our country, and they're not really recognized the way they should be,"" said Mr. Trump. He told the officers that every time he mentions the police, he gets an ovation at his rallies.Patrol Officer Adam Beland said the officers talk about politics every day -- and he is firmly on team Trump, as are many of the officers. ""I just think he speaks what people are trying to say, and he has the nerve to say it,"" he said.Mr. Trump's attacks on Mr. Cruz have resonated with some voters in the state. ""I liked Cruz but I'm not liking how he's handled Iowa,"" said Lois Flad, 69, a retiree, while waiting in line to see Mr. Trump address a crowd gathered here Thursday. ""That was the last straw.""Meanwhile, Mr. Cruz sought to turn the tables and use Mr. Trump's complaints against him. He coined the phrase ""Trump-tantrum"" on Wednesday and said Thursday that Mr. Trump seemed ""rattled.""""I don't know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way having his finger on the button,"" Mr. Cruz told the crowd in Nashua, N.H.During a Thursday evening interview on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" Mr. Trump said he was over Iowa and was now focused on New Hampshire. He said that he wanted to win the state.Asked about Mr. Cruz's tantrum attack, Mr. Trump embraced it as a sign of his forceful personality. ""I love that phrase. I actually like that,"" Mr. Trump said.---Patrick O'Connor and Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.Credit: By Heather Haddon",4/8/16
The Economy Trumps Everything,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762280487?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, it may truly be said, drove to the surface of our politics heretofore unrecognized degrees of voter anger. It may be Mr. Trump's misfortune that he has wrongly calculated the core reason for that anger.He believed the big revelation of his June presidential announcement speech was support for his criticism of U.S. immigration policy. And so he rode it.Elections are won or lost at the margin, and the margin is where Mr. Trump lost Iowa to Ted Cruz by three points.The Iowa entrance polls reveal that Mr. Trump got 44% of the vote from people who believe immigration is the campaign's top issue. Unfortunately, at least in Iowa, only 13% think that. Ted Cruz got 34% of their vote. Immigration matters, but Messrs. Cruz and Trump may be overweighting its importance in election outcomes.On the central conservative issue of government spending -- Iowa Republicans' top concern at 32% -- Mr. Cruz led with 27% to Mr. Trump's meager 19%. Mr. Trump also trailed Marco Rubio here.Sophists might argue that spending is Republican code for suppressing outlays on Social Security and Medicare, which Mr. Trump, with an eye toward the general election, has said he won't do. Then let's move on to the less partisan subject of jobs and the economy, which Iowa Republicans' identified as their second most-pressing issue. Marco Rubio won them with 30% of the vote.At the margin, Mr. Trump lost votes to Messrs. Cruz and Rubio on spending and to Mr. Rubio on the economy.For the purposes of my argument -- that the U.S.'s economy should be dominating the 2016 primaries -- I combine government spending and economy/jobs into one issue. For Iowa Republicans, that puts economic concerns at nearly 60%.Meet the Democrats. The economy and jobs are the top concern for 33% of Iowa Democrats. As an ideological obsession, they substitute ""income inequality"" for spending, at 27%. Toss in ""health care"" at 30% and the economy is the only issue for Democrats.What makes Iowans' elevated economic worries intriguing as a proxy for the primaries is that their state isn't doing badly. Iowa's nominal unemployment rate is 3.4%. New Hampshire's is 3.1%.But in South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 20, unemployment is 5.5% Three days later come the caucuses in Nevada, whose jobless rate is 6.4%. At least three states in the March 1 Super Tuesday primary are hurting -- Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama.Conventional wisdom holds that Hillary Clinton will sink Bernie Sanders once she gets to the family's automatic black votes in the South. Don't be shocked, though, if Bernie's economic populism finds an ear there, too.The unemployment rate for black men in South Carolina was 12.2% when last measured in the first quarter of 2015. In Arkansas it was 13.2% and over 9% in Texas. Mrs. Clinton better hope young black males are still mooning over a Clinton presidency that ended 15 years ago.""It's the economy, stupid"" is a famous phrase about the importance of political messaging in a presidential campaign. Most Americans, who aren't stupid, know that in the eighth year of Barack Obama's presidency, the U.S. economy is simply not normal.U.S. economic growth in last year's final quarter was 0.7%. The stock market has taken up cliff-diving. That's tough on the former savers who decided they couldn't survive two presidential terms with the Federal Reserve's microscopic interest rates, and moved into stocks.This newspaper reported days ago that the number of initial public offerings from young companies in January was . . . zero. The reason is ""a broad retreat from risk by investors.""Let us not forget China, which permits us not to forget Donald Trump's role in all this.Last year China's economy grew at its slowest rate in more than 20 years. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its 2016 growth estimates for the world economy.Amid nearly every arrow out there pointing downward, Mr. Trump floated the idea of imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the U.S.Another Republican TV debate bubbles up this Saturday. The Trump tariff came up the last time he participated, and one wonders if this time someone will push the argument further -- to the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariff and the Great Depression. He may win New Hampshire, but if the others close the gap, doubts about his economic statements will be the reason.Ted Cruz also tanked on the economy and jobs in Iowa, receiving a surprisingly small 18% of that vote. He's doing all right on the two issues he has politicized -- immigration and Washington spending -- but has little voter resonance on the economy itself.The details of Iowa's voting suggest Mr. Cruz is self-defining himself out of the economic-growth issue. For now, Marco Rubio has taken control of the one subject with the biggest base in American politics -- the economy and jobs.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",4/8/16
How Trump Blew an Easy Win,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762280425?accountid=12768,"It was quite a turnaround. After he led in Iowa most of December, Ted Cruz's numbers started falling Jan. 6, after Donald Trump declared him ineligible for the presidency because he was born in Canada. But Mr. Cruz unleashed a disciplined, data-driven get-out-the-vote effort aimed at social conservatives. The Texan won Iowa with 28% of the vote, four points ahead of where he stood going into caucus day, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average.Then Mr. Cruz gave the evening's most undisciplined victory speech, droning on for 32 1/2 minutes, nearly as long as the other major candidates combined. He said his win meant that the GOP nominee would not be chosen by ""the media,"" the ""Washington establishment"" or ""lobbyists."" Yet The Donald is championed by none of those.Mr. Cruz expressed, at length, his thanks for 800,000 contributions, a volunteer who quit his job to help in Iowa, two Chicago law students who spent their break canvassing the state, a teenage Texan who made 823 phone calls in one day, his campaign's top Iowa officials, his cousin Bebe, and his parents. Approaching the half-hour mark, his promise that ""morning is coming"" seemed a threat about how long he would speak.As impressive as his win was, Iowa is a state tailor-made for Mr. Cruz. His challenge now is New Hampshire, which lacks Iowa's substantial number of evangelicals, and where he hasn't spent the time or built the same kind of organization.Going into Monday's caucus Mr. Trump led by nearly five points in the Real Clear Politics average. But he barely came in second, with 24% of the final vote. Mr. Trump's refusal to attend the last debate, focus on the ground game or even have surrogates at many caucus meetings contributed to his defeat. He acted as if traditional rules didn't apply to him, and killed his chance for an easy victory.Mr. Trump's speech was the evening's shortest -- four minutes -- and surprisingly gracious. Yet he bragged that he was up by 28 points in New Hampshire (seven points higher than his actual lead in the polling average). He may prevail, but why raise expectations?Speaking of expectations, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio beat his, running six points ahead of his polling average, ending with 23%, just behind Mr. Trump. He gave the evening's best speech, describing himself as the underdog, assailing President Obama, and saying that Hillary Clinton's emails show ""she thinks she's above the law."" Mr. Rubio's Reagan-like challenge for Republicans was steeped in optimism. ""We will embrace all the principles that made America great,"" he said, ""and we will apply them to the unique challenges of this new century.""But if Mr. Rubio wants to emerge from the pack, he must keep his momentum in New Hampshire, which doesn't often follow Iowa's lead. His challenge is that others -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- have all invested more time there.On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton said Monday night that she was ""breathing a big sigh of relief."" Not long ago it seemed she could lose Iowa to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist. Mr. Sanders had enthusiasm: 43% of likely Democratic caucus-goers described themselves as ""socialist"" in a Jan. 10 survey for Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register.But Mrs. Clinton invested millions in the ground game that produced her narrow win. Her victory speech was angry, joyless and plaintive, as she begged Democrats to remember ""we have to be united."" By contrast Mr. Sanders told raucous supporters that by fighting Mrs. Clinton to a virtual draw, they had beaten ""the most powerful political organization in the United States."" Iowa, he declared, has sparked ""a political revolution.""Unlikely. Mr. Sanders leads in New Hampshire by 18 points, according to the polling average, and it's unclear whether Mrs. Clinton's organization alone can make up the difference. But when the race turns to the South, her advantage among nonwhite and moderate Democrats will probably sink Mr. Sanders, though he has enough money and youthful left-wing enthusiasm to ride on until the convention.The future on the GOP side remains opaque. New Hampshire will further narrow the field, but only 2% of delegates will be selected there and in Iowa. By February's end less than 5% will have been chosen. In 2012 the contest didn't dwindle to one candidate until May 14, and Mitt Romney didn't secure his delegate majority until May 29. This year, if three or maybe four Republicans are still standing after South Carolina, it could take until June -- or the convention -- for anyone to clinch the nomination.If Donald Trump had won Iowa, he could have run the table. Not now. We're in for a long haul.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the 1896 Election Still Matters"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",4/8/16
"Election 2016: Trump's D.C. Hotel to Open Early --- The high-profile project has, at times, been drawn into campaign politics",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762931599?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's real-estate company is planning to open its closely watched Washington, D.C., hotel project ahead of schedule, a move that could help underscore the Republican presidential candidate's skills as a developer.The Trump Organization, which has been converting the Old Post Office building with its soaring clock tower into a luxury 263-room hotel, is set to open it in early September, according to Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump's daughter, who has been spearheading the project. The opening had been expected by the hotel industry later in 2016.But Ms. Trump said in an interview that the opening of the Trump International Hotel actually would be two years ahead of schedule. She said the U.S. General Services Administration -- which owns the landmark building and is leasing it to the Trump Organization for 140 years -- said the $200 million project had to be completed by August 2018.Given the complexity in working with numerous government agencies and restoring a building built in the late 1800s, the September opening amounts to a ""herculean"" feat, she said.""It requires a lot more time on site than a ground-up project,"" she said.Mr. Trump, who has been leading the polls in the New Hampshire Republican primary, has no experience holding government office and has made his business career a cornerstone of his campaign. While the ups and downs of his half-century career have been hotly debated, few have challenged his success as a developer in bringing most of his real-estate projects in on time and on budget.Ms. Trump said the Trump Organization is announcing the opening of the Washington hotel now because it is going to start accepting reservations, and the timing has nothing to do with Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.Hotel experts have viewed the Washington project as a risky one for the Trump Organization partly because of the cost of the renovation and the large amount of competition that it faced in winning the GSA bid. Also, there are about 3,500 to 4,000 new hotel rooms in the pipeline in Washington, D.C., including a luxury Conrad Hotel now under construction at CityCenter, a few blocks from the Old Post Office building, according to Kannan Sankaran, managing director of CBRE Hotels.Mr. Trump so far has spent $42 million of his own money on the Washington hotel project, an unusually big bet for him to make at this stage in his career. While he was well-known for taking big risks in his early years, more recently many of his real-estate deals have involved licensing the Trump brand to other developers.But the Post Office conversion project was unique in its architecture, history and location on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol, Ms. Trump said. ""It's impossible not to be incredibly passionate about a project such as this,"" she said.The hotel will include a 13,200-square-foot ballroom, a nine-story atrium topped with a glass skylight and a suite called the ""Trump Townhouse,"" with its own entrance. The building's 315-foot clock tower is one of the highest points in the city and will be open to guests and tourists.Other bidders for the GSA long-term lease included Hilton Worldwide and Hyatt Hotels & Resorts.Some were surprised when the Trump Organization won, partly because its Trump Hotels chain -- which includes properties in New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, Toronto and other locations -- doesn't have the global reach of some of its competitors.Ms. Trump says GSA liked the fact that the Trump Organization was a family business and planned to hold the property for generations.""The joke was that my daughter, Arabella, who I was pregnant with at the time, was going to be negotiating with the government in decades to come,"" said Ms. Trump, who is close to nine months pregnant with her third child.Although the Trump Organization tries to keep business and politics separate, the Washington hotel project has gotten caught up in the campaign from time to time.Celebrity chef Jose Andres backed out of a plan to open a flagship restaurant at the hotel, citing the remarks Mr. Trump made in a June speech that Mr. Andres said disparaged Mexicans.Also, some have questioned whether other controversial statements Mr. Trump has made might turn away some hotel guests.Ms. Trump said that Mr. Andres's planned restaurant has been replaced with a BLT Prime steak house. She also disagreed that there would be any adverse business impact from her father's campaign remarks.""The support he's generated and enthusiasm we've seen across the country speak for themselves,"" she said.The Washington, D.C., hotel market currently is enjoying strong occupancy levels thanks to record tourism and demand from business travelers, CBRE's Mr. Sankaran said. Luxury hotels in particular are doing well because of the limited supply, he said.Room rates of the new Trump hotel haven't been announced, but Ms. Trump said that they would be ""at the highest level"" in the city. Mr. Sankaran said that luxury rates in the city range from $350 to $425 a night. He said he thought those rates would be ""achievable"" by the new Trump hotel.Credit: By Peter Grant",4/11/16
"Rubio Challenges Trump, Cruz in Poll",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1762768271?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The Republican presidential race in the Granite State increasingly looks like a referendum on Sen. Marco Rubio as much as on the current front-runner, Donald Trump.While the celebrity businessman still holds a double-digit lead ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Mr. Rubio ranked second in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters, released on Friday. It caps a week of the Florida senator rising in the polls following a surprisingly strong third-place finish in Monday's Iowa caucuses.Well-heeled donors in New York and other wealthy enclaves are showing renewed interest in Mr. Rubio. Other Republicans are rallying around him, including former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, his onetime rival who endorsed Mr. Rubio late Friday.Mr. Rubio has emerged as a clear alternative to Mr. Trump and the Iowa winner, Sen. Ted Cruz, for Republicans looking to back someone else. He was the top pick of 17% in the Marist poll, jumping six percentage-points from a pre-Iowa survey. Mr. Cruz had 15% and Mr. Trump led with 30%.Meanwhile, three current and former governors -- Jeb Bush of Florida, Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio -- are fighting to keep their bids alive, according to the new poll.Mr. Rubio's crowds have swelled, and in a sign that he can go deeper into the primary season, the Las Vegas newspaper owned by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, chief executive of Las Vegas Sands Corp., on Friday endorsed Mr. Rubio, a potential boost ahead of the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 23.""Even though he's scripted, he's solid on the issues,"" said James Betti, 58 years old, a physician from Rye, N.H., who attended a Trump event Thursday but is leaning toward supporting Mr. Rubio.Other Republicans will get a chance to slow Mr. Rubio's rise Saturday night at the last candidates' debate, sponsored by ABC News and WMUR, the local affiliate. Mr. Christie's attacks have been particularly fierce, dubbing Mr. Rubio ""the boy in the bubble"" for his reluctance to stray from his stump speech and questioning his record of achievement in the Senate.Joe McQuaid, publisher of the Union Leader, which has endorsed Mr. Christie, penned a stinging editorial that ran on the front page of Friday's paper criticizing Mr. Rubio. ""Young Rubio must think New Hampshire a bunch of rubes,"" he wrote. ""He hasn't spent much time here but is trying to sell himself with TV ads as someone who can go to Washington to clean up the Washington mess. Earth to Rubio: You are a U.S. senator. The Senate meets in Washington. You are hardly an outsider.""Mr. Cruz also enjoyed a post-Iowa bump in the poll following his win over Mr. Trump. He laughed off the increased attention on Mr. Rubio. ""If momentum was measured by the media, Marco Rubio would already be the Republican nominee,"" Mr. Cruz told reporters after a campaign stop in Weare, N.H. ""In the media's telling, bronze is the new gold. And Iowa demonstrated the media doesn't get to the pick the Republican nominee.""Some of the attacks -- that Mr. Rubio is too young, that he supported a pathway to citizenship for people in the country illegally, and that he has skipped too many Senate votes -- have sunk in with some voters here.""The thing that concerns me is him not being at the votes,"" said Charlie List, 58, of Derry, N.H., who attended a Rubio event Friday night but is still on the fence. ""Most people, if you don't show up for work, you don't get paid.""People fundraising for Mr. Rubio's team said fence-sitting Wall Street donors are finally warming to him. Bankers, hedge-fund managers, private-equity executives and other financial-industry professionals are promising to open their wallets, according to interviews with existing donors and some others who are planning to contribute.Investors would like to see Mr. Rubio prevail because he is a ""very business-friendly but competent, likeable candidate,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at HighTower Advisors.Mr. Rubio, 44, has already attracted some younger Wall Street donors who have not previously been all that politically active, including: Thomas Farley, president of NYSE Group; hedge-fund manager Eric Mandelblatt of Soroban Capital Partners LP; Brian Levine, a managing director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.; and Sean Klimczak, a senior managing director at Blackstone Group LP, say people familiar with the matter.In his closing argument to Iowa Republicans, Mr. Rubio talked up his conservatism, religious faith and ability to unite disparate wings of the GOP. In New Hampshire, he has spoken of uniting the entire country, an appeal that could resonate more in a state where independents accounted for nearly half of the GOP primary electorate in 2012.""We need to stop pitting Americans against each other,"" Mr. Rubio told hundreds of people packed into a second-floor bar in Dover, N.H., citing his work across the aisle in the Florida Legislature.Some undecided GOP primary voters here said Mr. Rubio's performance in Iowa, coupled with a perception that he would perform well against a Democrat in the general election, are the biggest factors working in his favor. In addition, they note that he seems more viable than other Republicans seeking the support of the party's less-conservative voters.But Mr. Rubio hasn't sealed the deal with them yet. Mark Swartz, 55, an undecided primary voter from Rye, said he is torn between Messrs. Kasich, Rubio and Trump. ""I'm not sure Kasich has the legs to make it to November,"" Mr. Swartz said. ""That's why I'm leaning toward Rubio.""---Reid J. Epstein contributed to this article.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor and Anupreeta Das",4/11/16

One thing Donald Trump is right about is that the Iran nuclear deal is one of the worst deals ever made. The U.S. virtually negotiated against itself by constantly rewarding Iran for missing deadlines and failing to negotiate in good faith. In the end, Iran got $150 billion to aid its economy and sponsor terrorism throughout the world, and we got assurances that the country would inspect its own nuclear sites. As one commentator said, it's like mailing a baseball player a drug test and allowing him to return the results. The deal failed to limit Iran's ability to fund terrorism and didn't deal adequately with the country's ability to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles that can be used to carry nuclear weapons.Unfortunately, Mr. Otaiba's hope for the reimposition of sanctions will likely fall on deaf ears.

Election 2016: Trump Wades Into Debate on Property Rights,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1763313340?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump waded into a thorny controversy over land-use issues in New Hampshire just before voters head to the polls to cast ballots in the state's presidential primary.Mr. Trump, who made his fortune in the real-estate industry, said during a Republican presidential debate on Saturday that he was in favor of robust use of eminent domain, the practice of government entities forcing property owners to sell land for development or infrastructure uses.Mr. Trump's support for the practice has potential risks nationally, as many conservatives oppose the practice as government overreach. The issue is particularly fraught in New Hampshire, where many residents are deeply skeptical of eminent domain -- especially Republican primary voters who are wary of government and strongly believe in private-property rights.For many officials in towns and cities across the Granite State, ""eminent domain is not in their toolbox at all, even for the most worthy of public projects,"" said Richard Uchida, a land-use lawyer at law firm Hinckley Allen's office in Concord, N.H.Angry voters amended New Hampshire's constitution to bar any use of eminent domain for ""private development"" following a controversial 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision in a Connecticut case, Kelo v. City of New London, that affirmed the right of governments to seize property and hand it another private owner to further economic development.The Kelo decision sent lasting political tremors well beyond New England. It set off a swift backlash in most state capitals and remains deeply unpopular in many quarters. John Paul Stevens, who crafted the Supreme Court's ruling in Kelo, later called it the ""most unpopular opinion I ever wrote.""In this weekend's debate, Mr. Trump launched into a defense of eminent domain, calling it ""an absolute necessity."" He endorsed using eminent domain to build the Northern Pass project -- a controversial 192-mile electrical transmission line that would carry power from Quebec to southern New England.""His embrace of eminent domain in the Northern Pass could certainly cost him votes in the north,"" said Ryan Williams, a Republican consultant who has worked in New Hampshire politics and now supports Jeb Bush.Northern Pass backers have long said it won't rely on eminent domain. Still, worries in recent years that land might be taken for that or other projects have sparked a flurry of bills in the state legislature, and skepticism about them crosses party lines.A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.Some of his Republican rivals have taken the opposite tack on the issue of eminent domain in advance of the New Hampshire primary -- and the issue could be a salient one for some voters with libertarian leanings. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticized Mr. Trump's history of using eminent domain when he was a real-estate developer. And at a stop in Peterborough, Sen. Ted Cruz called the 2005 Supreme Court decision on eminent domain ""a disgrace.""Credit: By Byron Tau and Ben Leubsdorf",4/15/16
"Trump, Sanders Roll in N.H. --- Cluster of GOP Rivals Leaves Field Muddled",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764093390?accountid=12768,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Donald Trump won the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary by a decisive margin Tuesday, claiming his first victory of the 2016 campaign and leaving the rest of the GOP field as murky as ever.The billionaire businessman received 35% of the vote -- more than double his nearest competitor -- allowing him to regain momentum in a race that he has led since the summer on the strength of his blustery, tradition-defying style.Lagging far behind was a cluster of rivals, none of whom broke from the pack enough to establish himself as a singular alternative to Mr. Trump.The biggest beneficiary was Ohio Gov. John Kasich, buoyed by a surge of late-deciding voters from far back in the pack. His second-place finish rescues him from near-certain elimination if he had failed to catch fire in a state he had made almost the sole focus of his campaign.New Hampshire had been expected to be a springboard for Sen. Marco Rubio, but his widely panned debate performance Saturday, where he was attacked repeatedly by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, proved damaging. Exit polls found two-thirds of voters said recent debates had been important to their decision on how to vote.For Mr. Christie, his withering takedown wasn't enough to elevate his own flagging campaign, casting doubt on his ability to continue in the race. He canceled his appearances in South Carolina, the site of the next GOP primary, opting to head home to New Jersey to consider his next steps in the presidential race. ""We're going to take a deep breath and see what the results are tonight,"" he said.Lou DeRosa, an energy consultant from Hampstead, said the debate left Mr. Rubio bruised by charges that he was too inexperienced and ill equipped for the presidency. ""I think that Rubio got destroyed by a little love tap in the debate,"" said Mr. De Rosa, who voted for Mr. Kasich.As returns came in, Mr. Rubio was trailing Mr. Kasich, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- winner of the Iowa caucuses -- and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a former mentor whose own faltering campaign may get some breathing room from the New Hampshire results.Mr. Rubio had been counting on his surprisingly strong third-place finish in Iowa to give him a head of steam -- ""Marcomentum,"" as his campaign has dubbed it in recent days. Polls had shown him steadily in second place in New Hampshire before the weekend debate.The results bring little clarity to the competition among GOP candidates who are seeking to be the mainstream GOP alternative to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. That portends a lengthy and difficult race because the longer there are at least three viable candidates amassing delegates, the harder it becomes for anyone to clinch the nomination.Mr. Trump's victory declaration by the Associated Press and television networks came so soon after the polls closed that many of his supporters had yet to arrive at his victory party.He hailed his win with characteristic bombast: ""We are going to do something so good, so fast and so strong, and the world is going to respect us again -- believe me.""Mr. Kasich promised his supporters a tough fight ahead. ""If you don't have a seat belt, go get one.""Mr. Trump's big lead belies skepticism about whether he could translate his huge rally crowds and high poll numbers into victory in a state where voters have high expectations of contact with presidential candidates.The near-deadlock among the next tier of candidates means that a robust competition among Messrs. Rubio, Kasich and other candidates will continue into the next primary contests on terrain less hospitable to those more-establishment oriented candidates.The nominating contest now moves to deeply conservative Southern states more hospitable to the candidacies of Messrs. Trump and Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses last week largely on the strength of evangelical Christian support.Next up are South Carolina and Nevada, where evangelicals and a stauncher brand of conservatism dominate. Beyond those states, the path to the nomination doesn't get much smoother for the party's establishment-oriented candidates. On March 1, 11 states vote in the so-called SEC primary, which includes Alabama, Georgia and Arkansas.Mr. Kasich, the candidate who diverges most often from conservative orthodoxy, is undaunted by the prospect. He has three events scheduled in South Carolina Wednesday, chartered a plane to carry the press along, and promised a full-court press even though he has only slim political organization beyond New Hampshire.""We take our snow boots off and put our flip-flops on,"" Mr. Kasich told reporters outside a polling site in Concord. ""We're going to go to South Carolina. We'll go tonight.""To be sure, New Hampshire could drive one or more candidates from the race but no one was ready to concede anything over the past week of intensive campaigning in the snow-blanketed Granite State.All nine candidates were scrambling to woo the many voters -- Republicans and independents -- who were undecided until the last minute. According to exit polls, 46% of GOP voters made up their mind on Tuesday or in last ""few days.""""In New Hampshire you can throw those polls away,"" said John Lyons, an 83-year-old Portsmouth independent who even put off the decision about which party's primary to vote in. ""People will go into that booth, and they won't mean a thing. People are different here in New Hampshire.""The GOP electorate is indeed distinctive. In New Hampshire, exit polls showed that 25% of voters said they are evangelicals or born-again Christians; they were 64% in Iowa and are projected to be 65% in South Carolina. New Hampshire's voters also are less conservative: 29% of primary voters said they were ""very conservative"" -- compared with 40% in Iowa and 36% in South Carolina.Exit polls showed Mr. Trump winning among almost every major demographic group. Only among evangelical voters did he not dominate, essentially tying Mr. Cruz for their votes. Among GOP primary voters who described themselves as ""moderate,"" Mr. Trump only narrowly beat Mr. Kasich, exit polls showed.Those voter surveys showed New Hampshire voters were more concerned about the economy and terrorism than they were about immigration, but among those who were worried about immigration, Mr. Trump garnered the biggest share of the vote.New Hampshire polls were unanimous in predicting a Trump victory, but the battle among the rest of the field came to resemble ""The Hunger Games,"" a fight for political life among several candidates.That battle for second and third place intensified in large part because Mr. Rubio seemed to lose momentum after a fumbling debate performance Saturday that fueled his rivals' claims that he is too inexperienced and ill-equipped for the presidency.The exit polls indicated a substantial number of late deciding voters went to Mr. Kasich. He benefited from voters like Sonya Bouchard, a Concord resident, who said she found his more upbeat campaign style appealing at a time when most candidates were attacking each other. ""I like that he's positive,"" she said, adding that she didn't decide on him until Tuesday morning. ""I don't like all the fighting.""New Hampshire exit polls suggest that Republicans may remain divided long after they pick a nominee. More than half of GOP primary voters said they would be disappointed if either Messrs. Cruz or Rubio claim the nomination. They split almost evenly on whether they would be satisfied or dissatisfied by Mr. Trump becoming the nominee.---Paul Overberg, Heather Haddon, Colleen McCain Nelson and Reid J.

But with a limited number of theaters, they're circling like planes waiting to land at La Guardia.""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Groundhog Day,"" plus the revival of ""Hello, Dolly!"" starring Bette Midler and a new production of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" have been announced for 2017, though venues are still to be announced.Cirque du Soleil Theatrical has plans to open its revival of ""The Wiz"" in the 2016-17 season, but the production is still awaiting a theater. Director Jerry Mitchell's ""Gotta Dance"" is waiting for schedules to align before announcing dates in either half of the season.""There are so many shows waiting for theaters. It used to not be like this,"" said Janet B. Rosen, producer of the Broadway-ready a cappella musical ""In Transit.""The schedule matters to ""In Transit,"" which is hoping to catch the ride that a cappella music is enjoying. ""Those 'Pitch Perfect' movies have vaulted it into public awareness,"" said Ms. Rosen.Among upcoming shows with announced theaters: ""Cats"" prances to the Neil Simon in July; in September, Lincoln Center Theater's ""Falsettos"" heads to the Walter Kerr and ""Holiday Inn, The New Irving Berlin Musical"" takes over Studio 54; and ""Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812"" waltzes into the Imperial in October with singer Josh Groban.Performer Plays the Trump CardFor his new monologue about Donald Trump, Mike Daisey immersed himself in the presidential candidate's world.""The Trump Card,"" set for Joe's Pub this summer, will be a biography and a story about politics, said Mr. Daisey, as well as a tale of showmanship.Mr. Trump is a ""frighteningly good speaker,"" Mr. Daisey said.The writer/performer followed the campaign closely, read a stack of books and re-watched multiple seasons of ""The Apprentice.""The latter, said Mr. Daisey, contain all the clues to understanding the businessman. ""He was always the same way: He's very mercurial.""Mr. Daisey sparked controversy in 2012 when his solo show ""The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs"" included fabricated stories of labor practices in China. Now, he said, he's careful about the lines between theater and journalism: ""I look more closely at how we are going to label it.""Playwright Says She Did the MathPlaywright Sarah Burgess conjures up a fierce debate about capitalism in her play ""Dry Powder,"" when partners at a private-equity firm argue over the future of a luggage manufacturer. But the most complicated part--at least for those a few decades from math class--may be the equation that Jenny, played by Claire Danes, rattles off at the end.Turns out, Ms. Burgess funded her playwright ambitions for years by working as a GMAT tutor. ""There is so much business for that in the city,"" she said, adding that she also prepped high-school students for standardized tests--and just getting through algebra.""It's a good job for a writer,"" said Ms. Burgess, who studied film at New York University and whose star is rocketing.""Dry Powder,"" onstage at the Public Theater through May 1, is her first major professional production and is directed Thomas Kail of ""Hamilton.""Compiled by Pia Catton",4/19/16
"Declarations: Trump, Sanders and the American Rebellion",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764828430?accountid=12768,"What is happening in American politics?We're in the midst of a rebellion. The bottom and middle are pushing against the top. It's a throwing off of old claims and it's been going on for a while, but we're seeing it more sharply after New Hampshire. This is not politics as usual, which by its nature is full of surprise. There's something deep, suggestive, even epochal about what's happening now.I have thought for some time that there's a kind of soft French Revolution going on in America, with the angry and blocked beginning to push hard against an oblivious elite. It is not only political. Yes, it is about the Democratic National Committee, that house of hacks, and about a Republican establishment owned by the donor class. But establishment journalism, which for eight months has been simultaneously at Donald Trump's feet (""Of course you can call us on your cell from the bathtub for your Sunday show interview!"") and at his throat (""Trump supporters, many of whom are nativists and nationalists . . .""), is being rebelled against too. Their old standing as guides and gatekeepers? Gone, and not only because of multiplying platforms. Gloria Steinem thought she owned feminism, thought she was feminism. She doesn't and isn't. The Clintons thought they owned the party -- they don't. Hedge-funders thought they owned the GOP. Too bad they forgot to buy the base!All this goes hand in hand with the general decline of America's faith in its institutions. We feel less respect for almost all of them -- the church, the professions, the presidency, the Supreme Court. The only formal national institution that continues to score high in terms of public respect (72% in the most recent Gallup poll) is the military.A few years ago I gave a lecture to a class at West Point, the text of which was: You are entering the only U.S. institution left standing. Your prime responsibility throughout your careers will be to keep it respected. I then told them about the Dreyfus case. They had not heard of it. I explained how that scandal rocked public faith in a previously exalted institution, the French army, doing it and France lasting damage. And so your personal integrity is of the utmost importance, I said, as day by day that integrity creates the integrity of the military. The cadets actually listened to that part.I mention this to say we are in a precarious position in the U.S. with so many of our institutions going down. Many of those pushing against the system have no idea how precarious it is or what they will be destroying. Those defending it don't know how precarious its position is or even what they're defending, or why. But people lose respect for a reason.To New Hampshire: The rejection of the establishment's preferred candidates in both major parties is a big moment. It is also understandable, the result of 15 years of failed presidencies. It is a gesture of rebuke toward the political class -- move aside.It's said this is the year of anger but there's a kind of grim practicality to Trump and Sanders supporters. They're thinking: Let's take a chance. Washington is incapable of reform or progress; it's time to reach outside. Let's take a chance on an old Brooklyn socialist. Let's take a chance on the casino developer who talks on TV.In doing so, they accept a decline in traditional political standards. You don't have to have a history of political effectiveness anymore; you don't even have to have run for office! ""You're so weirdly outside the system, you may be what the system needs.""They are pouring their hope into uncertain vessels, and surely know it. Bernie Sanders is an actual radical: He would fundamentally change an economic system that imperfectly but for two centuries made America the wealthiest country in the history of the world. In the young his support is understandable: They have never been taught anything good about capitalism and in their lifetimes have seen it do nothing -- nothing -- to protect its own reputation.It is middle-aged Sanders supporters who are more interesting. They know what they're turning their backs on. They know they're throwing in the towel. My guess is they're thinking something like: Don't aim for great now, aim for safe. Terrorism, a world turning upside down, my kids won't have it better -- let's just try to be safe, more communal.---A shrewdness in Sanders and Trump backers: They share one faith in Washington, and that is in its ability to wear anything down. They think it will moderate Bernie, take the edges off Trump. For this reason they don't see their choices as so radical.As for Mr. Trump, it is not without meaning that his supporters have had eight months to measure the cost of satisfying their anger by voting for him. In New Hampshire, 35% of the electorate decided that for all his drama and uncertainty they would back him.The mainstream journalistic mantra is that the GOP is succumbing to nativism, nationalism and the culture of celebrity. That allows them to avoid taking seriously Mr. Trump's issues: illegal immigration and Washington's 15-year, bipartisan refusal to stop it; political correctness and how it is strangling a free people; and trade policies that have left the American working class displaced, adrift and denigrated. Mr. Trump's popularity is propelled by those issues and enabled by his celebrity.In winning, Donald Trump threw over the GOP donor class. Political professionals don't fully appreciate that, but normal Americans see it. They get that the guy with money just slapped silly the guys with money. Every hedge-fund billionaire donor should be blinking in pain. Some investment!This leads me to Citizens United. Conservatives applauded that Supreme Court decision because it allowed Republicans to counter the effect of union money that goes to Democrats. But Citizens United gave the rich too much sway in the GOP. The party was better off when it relied on Main Street. It meant they had to talk to Main Street.Mr. Trump is a clever man with his finger on the pulse, but his political future depends on two big questions. The first is: Is he at all a good man? Underneath the foul-mouthed flamboyance is he in it for America? The second: Is he fully stable? He acts like a nut, calling people bimbos, flying off the handle with grievances. Is he mature, reliable? Is he at all a steady hand?Political professionals think these are side questions. ""Let's accuse him of not being conservative!"" But they are the issue. Because America doesn't deliberately elect people it thinks base, not to mention crazy.Anyway, we are in some kind of moment. Congratulations to the establishments of both parties for getting us here. They are the authors of the rebellion; they are a prime thing being rebelled against.Connected to that, something I've noticed. In Washington there used to be a widespread cliche: ""God protects drunks, children and the United States of America."" I'm in Washington a lot, and I've noticed no one says that anymore. They stopped 10 or 15 years ago. I wonder what that means.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",4/19/16
"REVIEW --- Trump's America --- The appeal of Donald Trump is no mystery, writes Charles Murray; The white working class is justifiably angry over its plight and the indifference of the country's elites",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1764828027?accountid=12768,"If you are dismayed by Trumpism, don't kid yourself that it will fade away if Donald Trump fails to win the Republican nomination. Trumpism is an expression of the legitimate anger that many Americans feel about the course that the country has taken, and its appearance was predictable. It is the endgame of a process that has been going on for a half-century: America's divestment of its historic national identity.For the eminent political scientist Samuel Huntington, writing in his last book, ""Who Are We?"" (2004), two components of that national identity stand out. One is our Anglo-Protestant heritage, which has inevitably faded in an America that is now home to many cultural and religious traditions. The other is the very idea of America, something unique to us. As the historian Richard Hofstadter once said, ""It has been our fate as a nation not to have ideologies but to be one.""What does this ideology -- Huntington called it the ""American creed"" -- consist of? Its three core values may be summarized as egalitarianism, liberty and individualism. From these flow other familiar aspects of the national creed that observers have long identified: equality before the law, equality of opportunity, freedom of speech and association, self-reliance, limited government, free-market economics, decentralized and devolved political authority.As recently as 1960, the creed was our national consensus. Running that year for the Democratic nomination, candidates like John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert Humphrey genuinely embraced the creed, differing from Republicans only in how its elements should be realized.Today, the creed has lost its authority and its substance. What happened? Many of the dynamics of the reversal can be found in developments across the whole of American society: in the emergence of a new upper class and a new lower class, and in the plight of the working class caught in between.In my 2012 book ""Coming Apart,"" I discussed these new classes at length. The new upper class consists of the people who shape the country's economy, politics and culture. The new lower class consists of people who have dropped out of some of the most basic institutions of American civic culture, especially work and marriage. Both of these new classes have repudiated the American creed in practice, whatever lip service they may still pay to it. Trumpism is the voice of a beleaguered working class telling us that it too is falling away.Historically, one of the most widely acknowledged aspects of American exceptionalism was our lack of class consciousness. Even Marx and Engels recognized it. This was egalitarianism American style. Yes, America had rich people and poor people, but that didn't mean that the rich were better than anyone else.Successful Americans stubbornly refused to accept the mantle of an upper class, typically presenting themselves to their fellow countrymen as regular guys. And they usually were, in the sense that most of them had grown up in modest circumstances, or even in poverty, and carried the habits and standards of their youths into their successful later lives.America also retained a high degree of social and cultural heterogeneity in its communities. Tocqueville wrote of America in the 1830s as a place where ""the more opulent citizens take great care not to stand aloof from the people."" That continued well into the 20th century, even in America's elite neighborhoods. In the 1960 census, the median income along Philadelphia's Main Line was just $90,000 in today's dollars. In Boston's Brookline, it was $75,000; on New York's Upper East Side, just $60,000. At a typical dinner party in those neighborhoods, many guests would have had no more than a high-school diploma.In the years since, the new upper class has evolved a distinctive culture. For a half-century, America's elite universities have drawn the most talented people from all over the country, socialized them and often married them off to each other. Brains have become radically more valuable in the marketplace. In 2016, a dinner party in those same elite neighborhoods consists almost wholly of people with college degrees, even advanced degrees. They are much more uniformly affluent. The current median family incomes for the Main Line, Brookline and the Upper East Side are about $150,000, $151,000 and $203,000, respectively.And the conversation at that dinner party is likely to be completely unlike the conversations at get-togethers in mainstream America. The members of the new upper class are seldom attracted to the films, TV shows and music that are most popular in mainstream America. They have a distinctive culture in the food they eat, the way they take care of their health, their child-rearing practices, the vacations they take, the books they read, the websites they visit and their taste in beer. You name it, the new upper class has its own way of doing it.Another characteristic of the new upper class -- and something new under the American sun -- is their easy acceptance of being members of an upper class and their condescension toward ordinary Americans. Try using ""redneck"" in a conversation with your highly educated friends and see if it triggers any of the nervousness that accompanies other ethnic slurs. Refer to ""flyover country"" and consider the implications when no one asks, ""What does that mean?"" Or I can send you to chat with a friend in Washington, D.C., who bought a weekend place in West Virginia. He will tell you about the contempt for his new neighbors that he has encountered in the elite precincts of the nation's capital.For its part, mainstream America is fully aware of this condescension and contempt and is understandably irritated by it. American egalitarianism is on its last legs.While the new upper class was seceding from the mainstream, a new lower class was emerging from within the white working class, and it has played a key role in creating the environment in which Trumpism has flourished.Work and marriage have been central to American civic culture since the founding, and this held true for the white working class into the 1960s. Almost all of the adult men were working or looking for work, and almost all of them were married.Then things started to change. For white working-class men in their 30s and 40s -- what should be the prime decades for working and raising a family -- participation in the labor force dropped from 96% in 1968 to 79% in 2015. Over that same period, the portion of these men who were married dropped from 86% to 52%. (The numbers for nonwhite working-class males show declines as well, though not as steep and not as continuous.)These are stunning changes, and they are visible across the country. In today's average white working-class neighborhood, about one out of five men in the prime of life isn't even looking for work; they are living off girlfriends, siblings or parents, on disability, or else subsisting on off-the-books or criminal income. Almost half aren't married, with all the collateral social problems that go with large numbers of unattached males.In these communities, about half the children are born to unmarried women, with all the problems that go with growing up without fathers, especially for boys. Drugs also have become a major problem, in small towns as well as in urban areas.Consider how these trends have affected life in working-class communities for everyone, including those who are still playing by the old rules. They find themselves working and raising their families in neighborhoods where the old civic culture is gone -- neighborhoods that are no longer friendly or pleasant or even safe.These major changes in American class structure were taking place alongside another sea change: large-scale ideological defection from the principles of liberty and individualism, two of the pillars of the American creed. This came about in large measure because of the civil rights and feminist movements, both of which began as classic invocations of the creed, rightly demanding that America make good on its ideals for blacks and women.But the success of both movements soon produced policies that directly contradicted the creed. Affirmative action demanded that people be treated as groups. Equality of outcome trumped equality before the law. Group-based policies continued to multiply, with ever more policies embracing ever more groups.By the beginning of the 1980s, Democratic elites overwhelmingly subscribed to an ideology in open conflict with liberty and individualism as traditionally understood. This consolidated the Democratic Party's longtime popularity with ethnic minorities, single women and low-income women, but it alienated another key Democratic constituency: the white working class.White working-class males were the archetypal ""Reagan Democrats"" in the early 1980s and are often described as the core of support for Mr. Trump. But the grievances of this group are often misunderstood. It is a mistake to suggest that they are lashing out irrationally against people who don't look like themselves. There are certainly elements of racism and xenophobia in Trumpism, as I myself have discovered on Twitter and Facebook after writing critically about Mr. Trump.But the central truth of Trumpism as a phenomenon is that the entire American working class has legitimate reasons to be angry at the ruling class. During the past half-century of economic growth, virtually none of the rewards have gone to the working class. The economists can supply caveats and refinements to that statement, but the bottom line is stark: The real family income of people in the bottom half of the income distribution hasn't increased since the late 1960s.During the same half-century, American corporations exported millions of manufacturing jobs, which were among the best-paying working-class jobs. They were and are predominantly men's jobs. In both 1968 and 2015, 70% of manufacturing jobs were held by males.During the same half-century, the federal government allowed the immigration, legal and illegal, of tens of millions of competitors for the remaining working-class jobs. Apart from agriculture, many of those jobs involve the construction trades or crafts. They too were and are predominantly men's jobs: 77% in 1968 and 84% in 2015.Economists still argue about the net effect of these events on the American job market. But for someone living in a town where the big company has shut the factory and moved the jobs to China, or for a roofer who has watched a contractor hire illegal immigrants because they are cheaper, anger and frustration are rational.Add to this the fact that white working-class men are looked down upon by the elites and get little validation in their own communities for being good providers, fathers and spouses -- and that life in their communities is falling apart. To top it off, the party they have voted for in recent decades, the Republicans, hasn't done a damn thing to help them. Who wouldn't be angry?There is nothing conservative about how they want to fix things. They want a now indifferent government to act on their behalf, big time. If Bernie Sanders were passionate about immigration, the rest of his ideology would have a lot more in common with Trumpism than conservatism does.As a political matter, it is not a problem that Mr. Sanders doesn't share the traditional American meanings of liberty and individualism. Neither does Mr. Trump. Neither, any longer, do many in the white working class. They have joined the other defectors from the American creed.Who continues to embrace this creed in its entirety? Large portions of the middle class and upper middle class (especially those who run small businesses), many people in the corporate and financial worlds and much of the senior leadership of the Republican Party. They remain principled upholders of the ideals of egalitarianism, liberty and individualism.And let's not forget moderate Democrats, the spiritual legatees of the New Deal. They may advocate social democracy, but they are also unhappy about policies that treat Americans as members of groups and staunch in their support of freedom of speech, individual moral responsibility and the kind of egalitarianism that Tocqueville was talking about. They still exist in large numbers, though mostly in the political closet.But these are fragments of the population, not the national consensus that bound the U.S. together for the first 175 years of the nation's existence. And just as support for the American creed has shrunk, so has its correspondence to daily life. Our vaunted liberty is now constrained by thousands of petty restrictions that touch almost anything we want to do, individualism is routinely ignored in favor of group rights, and we have acquired an arrogant upper class. Operationally as well as ideologically, the American creed is shattered.Our national identity is not altogether lost. Americans still have a vivid, distinctive national character in the eyes of the world. Historically, America has done a far better job than any other country of socializing people of many different ethnicities into displaying our national character. We will still be identifiably American for some time to come.There's irony in that. Much of the passion of Trumpism is directed against the threat to America's national identity from an influx of immigrants. But the immigrants I actually encounter, of all ethnicities, typically come across as classically American -- cheerful, hardworking, optimistic, ambitious. Keeping our national character seems to be the least of our problems.Still, even that character is ultimately rooted in the American creed. When faith in that secular religion is held only by fragments of the American people, we will soon be just another nation -- a very powerful one, a very rich one, still called the United States of America. But we will have detached ourselves from the bedrock that has made us unique in the history of the world.---Mr. Murray is the W.H. Brady Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

Politics & Ideas: Trump's Hostile GOP Takeover,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765510113?accountid=12768,"As the South Carolina presidential primary looms, the Republican Party faces a moment of truth. Since 1980, the winner of the state's Republican primary has gone on to win the nomination every time except 2012. This time, with less than a week to go, Donald Trump leads his nearest rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, by a margin of more than 2 to 1. It would take a seismic shift in the contest's closing days to produce victory for anyone other than the New York billionaire.Not long ago, longtime leaders of the Republican establishment seemed poised to make their peace with Mr. Trump. As a man of no fixed principles, they reasoned, he was someone with whom they could do business. Without deep roots in their party, he would leave the current structure and personnel pretty much as they are. Faced with the challenges of actual governance, he would end up staffing his administration with their people and taking their advice.After Mr. Trump's beyond-the-pale debate performance on Saturday, they may want to reconsider. The front-runner declared war on the entire Republican Party and made clear his intention to execute a hostile takeover. Jaws dropped from coast to coast when he accused George W. Bush of lying about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction so that he could plunge the nation into a war to overthrow Saddam Hussein.To state the obvious, this accusation is false, and recklessly so. Although I was an early, fervent opponent of the Iraq war, it was clear to me and most others that senior Bush administration officials and the president himself believed what they were saying.In advance of his 2003 U.N. speech, Secretary of State Colin Powell spent nearly a week at the CIA vetting the intelligence supporting the claim that Iraq had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and a rapidly advancing nuclear-weapons program.Mr. Powell emerged satisfied enough to deliver the speech he came to regard as a blot on his record. Although he later pronounced himself ""devastated"" that some intelligence officials muzzled their doubts about the reliability of the evidence against Saddam Hussein, he never intimated that President Bush was party to a world-historical deception.In the wake of behavior that plumbs the depths of irresponsibility, one might imagine support for Mr. Trump among the party faithful would collapse. Perhaps it will, but there is as yet no evidence of such a development.A survey sponsored by the South Carolina House Republican Caucus and conducted on Sunday, the day after the debate, found Mr. Trump's support holding firm at 33%, with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz at 14%, Jeb Bush at 13% and John Kasich at 10%. The front-runner led in every category, topping Mr. Cruz among tea party identifiers and libertarians, topping Mr. Rubio among conservatives and Mr. Kasich among moderates. Mr. Trump led among seniors, young adults and every age cohort in between.Although the survey didn't break out white evangelicals, who will make up about 60% of the Republican-primary electorate in the state, basic math shows that Mr. Trump is virtually certain to be leading Mr. Cruz in this category as well. (He beat Mr. Cruz 28%-24% among these voters in New Hampshire.) If so, this would be astounding. Evangelicals have long taken personal conduct as a test of fitness for public office, and Mr. Trump doesn't come close to passing that test. When it comes to matters that evangelicals say they care about, Mr. Trump's conversion to social conservatism is of recent vintage and dubious reliability.I have asked some respected evangelical intellectuals to explain this curious phenomenon. Most express baffled dismay. One offered a disturbing hypothesis: Evangelicals are terrified that everything they value is under assault, and they have concluded that only a strongman can stem the tide. So they are willing to make common cause with someone they normally would disdain. But when you sup with the devil, goes the saying, you'd better have a long spoon.The Trump phenomenon offers a moral challenge not only to evangelicals, but to the entire Republican leadership. Nine months ago I couldn't imagine a scenario in which Mr. Trump would receive his party's nomination and go on to win the presidency. Now I can. If he wins in South Carolina, conscientious Republicans will have to ask themselves whether they can be complicit in a course of events that hands the Oval Office to a man so manifestly unfit for the presidency. It is hard to decide which is a greater threat to the republic -- Donald Trump's pervasive ignorance or his deep-seated character flaws.Some leading Republicans have quietly told me that they would break ranks if Mr. Trump wins their party's nomination. A few have said so publicly. Unless a viable alternative emerges soon, every Republican will face the same dilemma.Credit: By William A. Galston",4/21/16

Trump Loses Ground in New Poll,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765761579?accountid=12768,"Support for Donald Trump among Republicans has declined in the past month, leaving him slightly behind Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP presidential race, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted after a combative debate performance that may have soured some voters on the New York businessman.Mr. Trump had enjoyed a double-digit lead over his rivals, but the new poll found support for him falling by seven percentage points since mid-January. Among registered voters who said they would participate in a GOP primary, he drew 26% support in the new poll, trailing Mr. Cruz, whose support rose by eight points to 28%. The survey, of 400 registered voters who said they would participate in a GOP primary, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.A number of other GOP candidates have dropped out of the race, a winnowing of the field that has benefited Mr. Trump's rivals. The poll shows that if the primary came down to a head-to-head choice, both Mr. Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio could beat Mr. Trump by double-digit margins.For now, however, there are six candidates in the race. The poll found that Mr. Rubio had solidified his third-place position, rising four points in the past month to 17% support.Ohio Gov. John Kasich jumped from the bottom tier of the field to fourth place, with 11%. He edged out retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who had 10% support in the new poll, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who slid to a low mark of 4%.The new survey marks the first time since the fall that the Journal/NBC News poll has found anyone other than Mr. Trump in the lead among Republicans nationally, and it differs from other recent national surveys that show him holding a steady lead. For example, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, also released Wednesday, shows Mr. Trump with a lead of more than 20 points nationally. That means the Journal/NBC survey could reflect a shift in mood, a temporary blip or a finding outside the mainstream.""When you see a number this different, it means you might be right on top of a shift in the campaign,"" said Bill McInturff, a GOP pollster who conducted the survey with Democratic pollster Fred Yang. ""What you don't know yet is if the change is going to take place or if it is a momentary pause before the numbers snap back into place.""Mr. Yang said the poll suggests Mr. Trump, with fewer opponents, may be nearing the limit of his support. ""As the field shrinks, as the spotlight becomes more glaring on him, he does have a ceiling,"" Mr. Yang said on MSNBC.Mr. McInturff noted that the Republicans surveyed included more who identified themselves as very conservative, which plays to Mr. Cruz's strength. But even taking that into account, he said, it is clear Mr. Trump's lead has turned into a virtual tie in this poll.Mr. Trump leads in polls in South Carolina, site of the next primary, to be held Saturday.The Journal/NBC national poll was conducted Feb. 14-16, the three days after GOP candidates met in a televised debate in South Carolina. Mr. Trump turned in an especially aggressive, insult-laced performance, faulting Mr. Bush's brother, former President George W. Bush, for failing to stop the 9/11 terror attacks.Daniel Cleveland, 25, who lives outside Spartanburg, S.C., said he had been considering Mr. Trump. But he was turned off by Mr. Trump's debate performance.""He just lost his cool,"" said Mr. Cleveland.Bonnie Kartes, 41, of Buckeye, Ariz., who participated in the poll, said she finds Mr. Kasich appealing and is dismayed by what she has seen from Mr. Trump in debates.""I thought at first maybe he was serious, but the more I watched him, to me he is not serious,"" Mrs. Kartes said.Some Republican candidates have argued that the death of conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and the coming fight to name his successor, should re-emphasize to voters that the eventual nominee should be the one best equipped to defeat the Democratic candidate. But the poll found that electability isn't the top concern of GOP primary voters. Asked which quality matters most in deciding to support a candidate, 35% said ""shares your values,"" while only 16% picked ""can win in November.""Scott Faulkner, a Republican from Concord, N.C., said he likes many things about Mr. Bush but is supporting Mr. Trump, because he believes Mr. Bush is unlikely to win in the fall. ""He's got a tough row to hoe,"" said Mr. Faulkner. ""Trump would have a better chance of beating [Democrat Hillary] Clinton.""A big shift came among so-called traditional-values conservatives, a pivotal group of abortion-rights and gay-marriage opponents who make up half of the GOP primary voters surveyed.Among that group, Mr. Trump drew support from 20%, down from 31% in a Journal/NBC poll a month ago.In another warning sign for Mr. Trump, the poll found a significant drop in a broader measure of his acceptability as a candidate: The share of Republican primary voters who could see themselves supporting him as the nominee fell to 56% from 65% a month ago.When Republican candidates were pitted against each other in test match-ups, the poll found that Messrs. Cruz and Rubio were about equally equipped to best Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump would lose to Mr. Cruz by 56% to 40%, the poll found. Mr. Rubio would beat Mr. Trump by 57% to 41%.The poll found Mr. Trump would beat Mr. Bush by 54% to 43%, and he would beat Mr. Kasich by 52% to 44%.---Josh Dawsey contributed to this article.---The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 800 registered voters, including 280 respondents who use only a cellphone. It was conducted from Feb. 14-16, 2016, by the polling organizations of Bill McInturff at Public Opinion Strategies and Fred Yang at Hart Research Associates.Individuals were selected proportionate to the nation's population in accordance with a probability sample design that gives all landline telephone numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance to be included. Registered voters age 18 or older were selected by a systematic procedure to provide a balance of respondents by sex. The cellphone sample was drawn from a list of cellphone users nationally. Of the 800 interviews, 280 respondents were reached on a cellphone and screened to ensure their cellphone was the only phone they had. In addition, 21 respondents were reached on a cellphone but reported also having a landline.Overall, the data's margin of error is plus or minus 3.46 percentage points. The margin of error for subgroups is larger. Additional interviews were conducted on a select series of questions from a random national sample of past primary voters. These interviews, when added to the interviews collected from the national adult data, achieved totals of 400 Republican and 400 Democratic primary voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.90 percentage points for these samples.Credit: By Janet Hook",4/22/16
Trump Didn't Oppose the Iraq War,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1765753154?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump went loony-left during last Saturday's GOP debate in South Carolina. In a heated moment the reality TV celebrity told the crowd that President George W. Bush had ""lied"" about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.This wasn't the first time that Mr. Trump went off the deep end as a candidate. In October he blamed President Bush for the Sept. 11 attacks, telling CNN: ""They knew an attack was coming. George Tenet, the CIA director, knew in advance there was going to be an attack, and he said so to the president."" He expanded this accusation Saturday, saying that Mr. Bush ""had the chance"" to kill Osama bin Laden before 9/11 but ""didn't listen to the advice of his CIA.""Mr. Trump obviously has not read George Tenet's memoir, ""At the Center of the Storm."" Though the CIA picked up an increasing stream of warnings about possible terror attacks at home and abroad in the months leading up to September 2001, this intelligence did not point to when, where, how and even whether the terrorists would strike. It was ""frightening but without specificity,"" Mr. Tenet wrote.Intimating that Mr. Bush knew about the coming attacks but did nothing to stop them makes Mr. Trump sound like a 9/11 truther. And the idea that the Bush administration blew a chance to kill al Qaeda's leader in its first nine months is a fairy tale. There was no such opportunity.Mr. Trump was body slammed for these charges Saturday, first by former Gov. Jeb Bush (""While Donald Trump was building a reality-TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe"") and then by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (""I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore"").The Donald, though, is cunning. The day after the debate, he claimed, ""I'm not blaming anybody,"" but only after first repeating his smear by saying, ""the CIA said there was a lot of information that something like that was going to happen.""Mr. Trump also claimed Saturday that he alone opposed the Iraq war. ""I'm the only one on this stage that said, 'Do not go into Iraq,'"" he asserted. ""I said it loud and clear, 'You'll destabilize the Middle East.'""This, too, is a fabrication. PolitiFact reviewed newspaper archives and TV transcripts and found that he did not publicly oppose the war before it began in March 2003. In January of that year he did discuss Iraq on Fox News, saying that President Bush ""has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know.""This is incoherent. Of course the president was either going to do something or not do something. And the U.N. did authorize military action by finding Iraq in material breach of the surrender agreement that Saddam signed to end the first Gulf War.In the same interview, Mr. Trump said that President Bush was ""doing a very good job."" He said that ""if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem."" But that is as far as Mr. Trump went -- and then he added, ""I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.""Then on March 25, 2003, in an interview after the Oscars, he called the war ""a mess"" and said: ""If they keep fighting it the way they did today, they're going to have a real problem."" The key to understanding his statement is the phrase ""the way they did today."" Mr. Trump had clearly heard about that day's bloody, confused fighting in the battle for Nasiriyah, which ended a few days later with a complete U.S. victory.None of this was a ""loud and clear"" warning ""not to go into Iraq."" None of this was a ""loud and strong"" declaration that ""you'll destabilize the Middle East."" They were instead the ramblings of a half-informed real-estate developer who now wants to sound like Henry Kissinger.The whole Trumpian shtick -- slandering a president, embracing ridiculous conspiracy theories, pretending to be a foreign-policy prophet -- is what we've come to expect. If Republican voters hand such an unstable individual their party's nomination, they will do immeasurable harm to it. Fortunately, there is still time to stop him.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the 1896 Election Still Matters"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",4/22/16
Brush Up Your Shakespeare; A global approval rating Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton can only envy.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783597454?accountid=12768,"Four hundred years after William Shakespeare departed this earth, and notwithstanding efforts by the politically correct to banish him from university curricula, this Dead White Englishman remains a global figure of astonishing vitality.That's not surprising, given his contributions to an English language that is the dominant tongue in today's world. Millions who have never read ""Richard III"" or witnessed a performance of ""The Merchant of Venice"" would be shocked to learn that many phrases they use every day (""give the devil his due,"" ""brave new world,"" ""eaten me out of house and home,"" ""wild goose chase,"" ""bated breath,"" ""a foregone conclusion,"" etc.) originated with or were popularized by the Bard of Avon.But more than English speakers have reason to be grateful. If a British Council survey of 18,000 people across 15 countries is to be believed, Shakespeare is more appreciated by those in the developing nations (Brazilians, Chinese, Mexicans, Indians and Turks) than by his fellow British. Across the globe he boasts a favorability rating--76% of those surveyed said they liked him--that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can only envy.Shakespeare has also turned out to be a solid economic asset, directly as a draw for tourism, and indirectly for giving foreigners a positive introduction to Britain. As the British Council report puts it, his popularity continues to be ""an important asset for the UK's prosperity and soft power.""Why the enduring, global popularity? The answer is simple. Though Shakespeare was a man who lived in England at a particular time, so well do his plays and poems capture the human condition that they speak to all people at all times. Which makes him as relevant in our world as he was in his own. We'd even go so far as to predict that Shakespeare will survive this era's progressive academic attempts to purge him for the sin of being the wrong race and gender.",4/23/16
"Democrats Avoid Jabs at Each Other, Keep Focus on Policy; Ahead of contests Tuesday, Bernie Sanders adopts more conciliatory tone; Hillary Clinton targets GOP's Donald Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783827151?accountid=12768,"PROVIDENCE, R.I.--Facing a tough series of contests this week, Bernie Sanders gave a fresh signal that he is ready to scale down his attacks on rival Hillary Clinton, dropping his argument that she is beholden to Wall Street banks by dint of large speaking fees she has gotten over the years.Mr. Sanders said he still believes he can win the nomination, but he conceded the path is difficult. The Vermont senator trails Mrs. Clinton by 275 pledged convention delegates, and the five states that vote Tuesday could leave him deeper in the hole. The biggest prize is Pennsylvania, with 189 delegates at stake. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll showed Mrs. Clinton 15 percentage points ahead of Mr. Sanders in Pennsylvania, a state where she has been showcasing her family ties.Asked on CNN if he still has a viable path to the nomination, Mr. Sanders said: ""Well, I'm not going to tell you that it's easy, but I think we do.""Mrs. Clinton and her husband, perhaps with an eye toward unifying the party once the nomination fight ends, largely avoided swipes at Mr. Sanders in advance of Tuesday's contests.Apart from Pennsylvania, voters will cast ballots in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Rhode Island. The terrain seems to favor Mrs. Clinton. She does best among minorities; in the 2008 Democratic primary, the Maryland electorate was more than one-third African-American.A poll released Sunday by Brown University's Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy found that among likely voters in Rhode Island's primary, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders 43% to 34%.Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton kept a tight focus on policy goals and stressed her local roots. Appearing in Scranton recently, she noted that she learned how to shoot a gun behind the cottage her grandfather built on Lake Winola in northeast Pennsylvania.Bill Clinton, in a speech over the weekend in the Philadelphia suburbs, took only the mildest jab at Mr. Sanders. The former president said he, too, has been talking about the issue of income inequality--and doing so with greater frequency.""I have a lot of respect for Sen. Sanders and what he's done and continually talking about income inequality,"" Mr. Clinton said at a middle school in Ambler, Pa. ""I believe I've given more speeches on it than anybody in the last 15 years and I never got half the attention he does.""As he has struggled to cut into Mrs. Clinton's delegate lead, Mr. Sanders has faced pressure from prominent Democrats to avoid the sorts of attacks that Republicans could use as a cudgel in a general election.He has largely ignored the advice. In what some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters view as a character attack, Mr. Sanders has called on the former senator and secretary of state to release the transcripts of paid speeches to Wall Street firms. His tone has been sarcastic, noting if she was commanding a speaking fee of $225,000 the prose must have been particularly eloquent, giving her every incentive to make the speeches public.But at a rally in Providence on Sunday, Mr. Sanders dropped the paid speeches riff and stuck to policy differences.Noting his call for a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health system, he said, for example: ""What Hillary Clinton thinks and what the establishment thinks, is that we don't have the guts to take on the private insurance companies and the drug companies.""He added, ""Well, they're wrong.""Looking beyond the Democratic race, he reserved much of his fire for Republicans and GOP front-runner Donald Trump.""I know there is some consternation and worry about Donald Trump becoming president of the United States,"" he said. ""Don't worry, it ain't gonna happen.""He predicted that the ""American public will not elect a president who virtually every day is insulting"" different groups of Americans.Mr. Sanders kept up the conciliatory tone in a series of appearances on the Sunday morning news shows.Asked on ABC's ""This Week"" whether he would become an enthusiastic supporter of Mrs. Clinton if she wins the nomination, the Vermont senator said: ""You know, I can't snap my finger and tell people what to do. But what I will do is do everything that I can to make sure that somebody like a Donald Trump, or some other right-wing Republican, does not become president of the United States.""Mr. Sanders has no plans to drop out of the race. Having built a large, enthusiastic following, Mr. Sanders would disappoint supporters in states that have yet to vote if he were to drop out now, his advisers say.Many people at the outdoor rally in Providence on Sunday were adamant that Mr. Sanders should keep battling.""The math with delegates doesn't look good, I'll admit it,"" said Nancy Smith, 62, a high school English teacher from West Greenwich, R.I. But given Mr. Sanders's popularity, the race ""should play out,"" she said.""It's just frustrating because it seems like people aren't being heard,"" said Ms. Smith.With the nomination within reach, Mrs. Clinton seems to be turning her attention more to the Republican field, particularly front-runner Donald Trump.Mrs. Clinton gave a speech Saturday in Rhode Island in which she mentioned Mr. Trump's name seven times; Mr. Sanders's name, zero.Anticipating that Mr. Trump will try to moderate his rhetoric, the Clinton campaign released a Web video Saturday that cautions voters not to buy into his ""extreme makeover.""The 95-second video includes snippets of Trump speeches that critics have seen as polarizing and incendiary, including his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. It also shows footage of a man sucker-punching a protester at a Trump rally.A message on the screen reads: ""Donald Trump wants you to forget everything he's said. Don't.""Mr. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., on Sunday praised his father's stance on some of those same issues that drew attacks from Democrats, including immigration. The younger Mr. Trump called his father ""the most un-P.C. candidate running for office right now"" and suggested that that quality would help him win the popular vote in November.Kate O'Keeffe contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Jennifer Levitz",4/25/16
U.S. News: Pro-Trump Group Boosts Fundraising,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382500?accountid=12768,"A pro-Donald Trump super PAC is ratcheting up activity, setting a fundraising goal of at least $15 million as the New York businessman moves toward clinching the Republican presidential nomination.Great America PAC last week hired a prominent GOP fundraiser who previously worked for a group backing former Republican presidential contender Rand Paul. The group plans to spend much of its bounty on Mr. Trump's behalf before the Republican convention in July.Mr. Trump, a real-estate billionaire, has primarily self-funded his operation, a fact he has made a centerpiece of his campaign. He highlights his relative lack of donors in every stump speech and criticizes his rivals as ""puppets"" for accepting the backing of super PACs fueled by rich donors.Yet in last week's Republican debate, Mr. Trump said in response to a question about whether he would take outside contributions for the general election that he had ""not made that decision yet.""Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, said the campaign had ""disavowed this and all PACs."" He said the campaign had sent a cease-and-desist order to the super PAC, but declined to provide a copy.Jesse Benton, the group's fundraiser and a longtime aide to Mr. Paul, said the super PAC had received no such letter and hadn't been contacted by the campaign other than being asked to change its name from TrumPAC, on the grounds the Trump name is trademarked.Mr. Trump has loaned at least $25 million to his campaign and collected at least $7.5 million in outside donations. Though he says he doesn't solicit outside funding, his campaign has a ""Donate"" button on its website that asks for contributions of up to $2,700, the most allowed per individual for the primaries. The campaign has received nearly 200 maximum donations, as of its latest filing.That operation may not prove tenable in a general election. In 2012, each side spent about $1 billion between campaigns, allied super PACs and national parties.Mr. Trump has said his net worth is $10 billion, although that figure can't be confirmed independently and it is unclear how much of that may be tied up in investments that can't easily be converted to cash.In the general election, Mr. Trump, if nominated, would most likely face Hillary Clinton, a formidable fundraiser. She raised $160 million through February, on top of at least $50 million raised by her super PAC -- which has conserved most of its funds for the general election.The pro-Trump super PAC formally registered with the Federal Election Commission in February. Its goal, Mr. Benton said, is to air positive ads about Mr. Trump in the months before this summer's convention, when he may be the presumptive nominee but wouldn't yet be able to tap into funds raised by the Republican National Committee, which are reserved for post-convention activities.Mr. Benton said the group wants to ensure the Trump campaign can ""punch back"" if Mrs. Clinton and her allied super PAC hammer the billionaire with negative ads prior to the convention. ""We want to make sure that the campaign has air cover,"" Mr. Benton said.The group's primary donor so far is Bill Doddridge, chief executive of the Jewelry Exchange. Mr. Benton said he has secured donations and pledges from several other donors, but declined to provide names. The group has raised and spent a six-figure sum so far, he said.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",4/25/16
"Trump, Clinton Power Ahead --- Democrat's Big Night Widens Her Imposing Lead Over Sanders",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382400?accountid=12768,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton won critical presidential primaries in the industrial Midwest and completed her sweep of the South on Tuesday, as she took full command of a contest that has been far more competitive than expected at the start.Rival Bernie Sanders was still hoping to win a close contest in Missouri, but that seemed nowhere near enough to change the dynamic of the race. Mrs. Clinton won in Ohio, Illinois, Florida and North Carolina, and blunted Mr. Sanders's momentum from a win last week in Michigan. She widened her already formidable delegate lead and made it improbable he can catch up.""We are moving close to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November,"" the former secretary of state and New York senator told cheering supporters in Florida, boasting that she has won more votes than any candidate in either party.She took a swipe at Mr. Sanders, saying he should be more specific about his plans, but she lodged a wholesale indictment of Republican front-runner Donald Trump. ""When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture -- that doesn't make him strong. It makes him wrong,"" she said.With 214 pledged delegates at stake, Florida was the night's biggest prize, while Illinois had 156 pledged delegates and Ohio 143 up for grabs. They will be awarded proportionally.Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders was ramping up his attacks on Mrs. Clinton, and has vowed to fight all the way to the summer convention. But he may now face increasing pressure to back off and revert to his earlier role as a candidate primarily driving a progressive, populist message rather than pursuing a viable path to the nomination.At his election night rally in Arizona Tuesday night, though, Mr. Sanders showed no signs of backing off. He pointed to Wall Street contributions to the super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton and repeated his call that she release transcripts of her high-priced speeches to Wall Street firms.""To my mind, if you're going to give a speech for $225,000 it must be a really great speech,"" he said. ""And if it's such a great speech, all of America should be able to read it.""With nearly all precincts counted, Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Sanders by 64.5% to 33% in Florida, by 54.5% to 41% in North Carolina and by 56.5% to 42.7% in Ohio.In Illinois, her margin was much closer, some 50.5% to 48.7% with 94% of precincts reporting.Mrs. Clinton had been expected to easily win Florida, with the state's demographics and rules barring independents from participating helping her. But Ohio was closely fought, and Mr. Sanders had hoped to parlay a victory last week in Michigan to the neighboring state. Both have seen a drain in manufacturing jobs, and Mr. Sanders put the blame squarely on free-trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton has long supported.Mrs. Clinton completed a sweep of the South, where strong support from African-Americans pumped up her totals. But her Ohio win was more important, showing she could win in the industrial Midwest.After Tuesday's vote, Mrs. Clinton was assured of adding at least 253 delegates to her column, bringing her total pledged delegates, who are chosen by the voters, to more than 1,000. Mr. Sanders was sure to add at least 124 delegates, but he was on track to end the night more than 300 delegates behind. Including superdelegates, who can vote for any candidate they like, her total topped 1,400, more than double his.At roughly the halfway point of the race, Sanders advisers say they now have the advantage. His campaign now looks ahead to contests next week in Arizona, Utah and Idaho, three states where aides have hoped to do well. But the next big delegate hauls aren't awarded until April: first in Wisconsin, and then the giant prize of New York, where Mrs. Clinton lives and which she represented in the Senate for eight years.In Florida, Mrs. Clinton's advantage was on display Tuesday in Miami, home to large populations of Hispanic and African-American voters who have gravitated to her campaign.""I like that she's a smart, charismatic woman,"" said Bridgette Thornton, a 37-year-old African-American attorney, who cast her ballot at a Miami church. ""It was a difficult choice for me, but I'm a practical person. Hillary has a better shot at winning the presidential election.""The race was closer in Ohio, where Mr. Sanders hammered his anti-free-trade views in recent days. Mrs. Clinton tried to recast her trade message, but the attempt fell flat with at least some voters.""The Clinton history with trade policies, that really just killed our area,"" said Fred Woke, a 57-year-old radio announcer who voted for Mr. Sanders in Niles.The challenge for both Democrats is that Mr. Trump, should he win the Republican nomination, would be an unconventional opponent who could pick up some of Mr. Sanders's populist arguments.That has some Clinton backers anxious for Mr. Sanders to ease up. ""The message of Sanders campaign has become personal attacks,"" said Robert Zimmerman, a superdelegate from New York who backs Mrs. Clinton. ""It's not only wrong, it's dangerous politically if he keeps up that tone.""Steve Elmendorf, a consultant who backs Mrs. Clinton, agreed there will come a point when Mr. Sanders needs to let up, but he said it isn't for Clinton supporters to say when. ""When it becomes clear you cannot win, then you should unite behind the nominee of the party and try to beat the Republicans,"" Mr. Elmendorf said. ""It's for him to decide when he can't win.""In 2008, Mrs. Clinton continued to compete in presidential-primary contests against then-Sen. Barack Obama even though he remained ahead in the delegate race the entire time.""Even if he doesn't think he will win the nomination, he's trying to amass as many delegates as he can,"" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. Delegates would give Mr. Sanders leverage at the party's convention and demonstrate the strength of his movement, Mr. Trippi said, adding, ""I don't see him relenting.""Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant in Florida who voted for Mrs. Clinton, said he doesn't worry that the Sanders attacks will damage her, partly because Democrats are sure to unify if Mr. Trump is the nominee. ""You want to get Democrats over the Sanders-Clinton thing, give them five seconds to think about Trump being within five feet of the nuclear codes,"" Mr. Schale said.---Arian Campo-Flores and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.(See related article: ""GOP Front-Runner Knocks Out Rubio, but Kasich Hangs Onto Ohio"" -- WSJ March 16, 2016)Credit: By Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson",4/25/16
"Trump, Clinton Power Ahead --- GOP Front-Runner Knocks Out Rubio, but Kasich Hangs Onto Ohio",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382358?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump scored victories in the Republican presidential primaries Tuesday, winning Florida, the biggest delegate prize of the night, and driving home-state Sen. Marco Rubio out of the race.Mr. Trump also won in North Carolina and Illinois. But Ohio Gov. John Kasich prevailed in his home state. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was battling Mr. Trump in a tight race in Missouri, slowing the front-runner's pace toward the GOP nomination.In his victory speech to supporters in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump vowed that his candidacy would broaden the reach of the Republican Party.""We have a great opportunity,"" he said. ""Democrats are coming in. Independents are coming in, and, more important, people who have never voted before.""Still, by defeating Mr. Rubio on his home turf, Mr. Trump dashed the hopes of Republican leaders who saw the young, Cuban-American senator as their best messenger to broaden the party's appeal.Mr. Kasich, a two-term governor and former congressman, is left as the only representative of a GOP leadership wary of the combative Mr. Cruz and openly hostile toward Mr. Trump.Tuesday's muddled results will make it harder for Mr. Trump to earn the 1,237 delegates he needs to claim the nomination before the Republican convention in July.""What we all thought would never happen -- a convention fight -- now has a better-than-even chance of occurring,"" said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised a super PAC backing former candidate Jeb Bush. ""We haven't seen a presidential election like this before, and we're unlikely to see one like it again.""Mr. Kasich's win in Ohio was his first of the GOP race, and it offers him a tenuous lifeline.""The campaign goes on,"" he told supporters in Cleveland, the site of the GOP convention in July. ""We're going to go all the way . . . and secure the Republican nomination.""Mr. Rubio emerged shortly after polls closed to announce that he was ending his campaign. He said his campaign was ill-timed for a year dominated by anger and resentment. ""While we are on the right side, this year we will not be on the winning side,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""While this may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimistic message about our future, I remain hopeful and optimistic about America.""It was a day of reckoning for the GOP leadership, which had targeted the winner-take-all contests in Ohio and Florida as the best chance to slow the New York businessman's momentum. Anti-Trump groups have plowed more than $35 million into attack ads, with the biggest share, $16 million, airing in Florida, according to Federal Election Commission reports.Mr. Trump scored an early win on Tuesday in the Republican caucuses on the Northern Mariana Islands and was expected to earn all nine of the territory's delegates. More than half of the total delegates to the Republican convention will have been awarded once votes in Ohio, Florida, Missouri, Illinois and North Carolina are tallied on Tuesday.Before Tuesday's votes, Mr. Trump had earned 460 delegates, compared with Mr. Cruz's 370. Mr. Rubio was in third place with 163 and Mr. Kasich had 63.Florida will award Mr. Trump all of its 99 delegates, while Ohio will give Mr. Kasich its 66 delegates.Mr. Cruz aimed to upset Mr. Trump in Missouri, which has 52 delegates, and was positioned to pick up a share of the 72 delegates in North Carolina and 69 delegates in Illinois. He also campaigned in Ohio and Florida in recent days with the hope of siphoning votes from Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio, and landing a coveted one-on-one match-up against the New York businessman in the remaining primaries. Yet Tuesday's results likely mean the best Mr. Trump's rivals can hope for is a contested convention.In a speech to supporters in his hometown of Houston, Mr. Cruz said Rubio supporters should join his campaign now that their candidate had dropped out. ""Starting tomorrow morning there is a clear choice,"" he said. ""We welcome you with open and welcoming arms.""Meanwhile, Mr. Trump, with a Tuesday call to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), is sending signals he is ready to step into the role of presumptive nominee.""We had a good conversation,"" Mr. McConnell said. The senator said he raised the issue of physical violence at Mr. Trump's rallies and said he told Mr. Trump: ""It might be a good idea to condemn that . . . no matter what the source.""Mr. Trump's continued rise comes despite harsh condemnations from the last two GOP nominees, former Gov. Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain. The GOP establishment has appeared powerless in the face of the pro-Trump populist uprising. And a convention nomination fight could provoke a backlash from his supporters and deepen divisions within the Republican Party.""That could be very self-destructive for Republicans,"" said Bill Nojay, a New York lawmaker and leading Trump supporter in his own state. ""Do we want to waste time fighting among ourselves, or unify behind Mr. Trump and focus on what's important, which is beating Hillary Clinton?""""In a sign that some Republicans are resigned to Mr. Trump being the nominee, a new super PAC was launched Tuesday to try to protect GOP majorities in Congress at a time when Mr. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric is tainting the party's image, according to the group's founders.As voters went to the polls Tuesday, the Conservative Bridge super PAC began sending fundraising emails to millions of Republicans around the country. Unlike other groups formed in response to Mr. Trump's rise, Conservative Bridge is not trying to intervene in the presidential race. Instead, the group is acting preemptively to try to boost vulnerable Republicans in down-ballot races with an untested candidate like Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket.""We are operating on the assumption that Donald Trump will be the presidential nominee,"" said Arizona-based political consultant Bert Coleman, who is among four Republicans at the new group's helm.""We think the presidential campaign as a whole, in particular Trump's harsh rhetoric, has damaged the Republican brand, and the name of the game is now turning out Republican voters in November.""Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Kasich said that he plans to offer more detailed critiques of Mr. Trump's policies and conduct in the campaign.Mr. Kasich told reporters after voting Tuesday morning in his hometown of Westerville that he would be ""forced going forward to talk about the way this campaign has been run by some others, by one other in particular.""""But today is not the day to do that,"" added Mr. Kasich, who has avoided negative attacks.Mr. Kasich is scheduled to campaign on Wednesday in Pennsylvania, though a Rubio supporter is challenging his spot on the April 26 ballot in court. He is also planning to stump in Utah on Friday ahead of its March 22 caucuses.The face-off between Mr. Kasich and Mr. Trump in Ohio was a particularly pointed test of whether the 2016 GOP electorate could be persuaded to support an experienced, accomplished politician in spite of widespread disgust with party-establishment leaders.Mr. Kasich's victory came in spite of the fact that many constituents were attracted to Mr. Trump's anti-establishment siren call.""I'm sick of the establishment, both Democrats and Republicans, they're screwing the U.S. citizens, shipping our work overseas,"" said Trump voter Rex Bailey, 64 years old, a Mansfield, Ohio, resident who said he was laid off from his job as a telephone company engineer in January.""Kasich is OK, but he's still part of the establishment.""---Reid J.

"Election 2016: Straight Fight With Trump Eludes Cruz --- Senator solidifies position, but Kasich win deprives him of one-on-one contest",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773382335?accountid=12768,"Tuesday's presidential primaries solidified Ted Cruz's position as the most formidable competitor to front-runner Donald Trump. But the results kept the Texas senator from his goal of winnowing the field to a two-man race between himself and the New York businessman.With Ohio Gov. John Kasich winning the primary in his home state, he is sure to remain in the race for the foreseeable future. That deprives Mr. Cruz of the one-on-one contest with Mr. Trump that he believes would allow him to rally the anti-Trump vote that has been split in a multi-candidate field.Still, with Sen. Marco Rubio vanquished in his home state of Florida and driven from the race, Mr. Cruz is strengthened and will emerge from the day's voting with more delegates than anyone but Mr. Trump. But his hopes increasingly will have to rest on blocking Mr. Trump from clinching the nomination, rather than on clinching it himself, and then battling at a contested party convention. Even as he steadily accumulates delegates, Mr. Cruz faces a rapidly narrowing path to secure the 1,237 delegates needed to win.""It will be mathematically possible, but, to me, it would be highly improbable,"" said Steve Munisteri, the former GOP chairman in Texas and former adviser to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's presidential campaign. Mr. Munisteri estimated that, even with a good night on Tuesday, Mr. Cruz would have to win some 8 out of 10 delegates up for grabs in the remaining contests.The next two states to vote, Arizona and Utah on March 22, will be crucial tests of Mr. Cruz's argument that anti-Trump voters will increasingly rally behind his candidacy. Those two states -- and the vast majority of other states still to vote -- give Mr. Cruz one advantage: They limit voting participation to registered Republicans. Mr. Trump so far has fared better in states that allow independents and Democrats to vote in GOP primaries.But Arizona poses a stiff challenge for Mr. Cruz, because illegal immigration, Mr. Trump's signature issue, is a top concern there, and the businessman has won endorsements from the state's leading crusaders against illegal immigrants, former Gov. Jan Brewer and Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County.Utah is more promising for Mr. Cruz, because Republicans, in lieu of primary elections, meet in caucuses. That is a more time-consuming nominating process that, in other states earlier this year, has rewarded Mr. Cruz's organizational prowess. What is more, Utah's GOP Sen. Mike Lee has endorsed Mr. Cruz, the first fellow senator to back him.The political road beyond that is less friendly to Mr. Cruz's brand of evangelical conservatism than the Southern states that have dominated the calendar so far. The spring brings many primaries in Northeastern states that are in Mr. Trump's backyard, as a lifelong New Yorker, and more inclined to back less-conservative Republicans than Mr. Cruz.Jeff Roe, the Cruz campaign manager, acknowledges there are tough fights ahead in such delegate-rich states as Wisconsin, New Jersey and New York. But he said the campaign's goal remains to clinch the nomination, not just prevent Mr. Trump from doing so.""We believe we can still win in the battlefield, and that is what we intend to do,"" Mr. Roe said.Still, the Cruz campaign is quietly arming for a contested convention in Cleveland if Mr. Trump fails to nail the nomination in advance. It is systematically trying to influence local GOP delegate selection processes to ensure as many Cruz supporters go to the convention as possible.Even though most convention delegates are bound by their state's rules to vote for specific candidates on the first ballot, based on their primary results, the delegates are free to support others if no candidate at the convention secures a majority and a second ballot is taken.Even before the March 1 primary in Texas, the Cruz campaign encouraged supporters to prepare to attend the precinct and county meetings that are the early stages of naming the state's convention delegates. That could amplify Cruz supporters' influence if the convention is embroiled in a multiballot fight. ""We have an entire operation focused on this,"" Mr. Roe said.Credit: By Janet Hook",4/25/16
Trump Aims for Knockout,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773150304?accountid=12768,"In a whirlwind of events on the eve of Tuesday's primaries, Donald Trump aimed to sideline two Republican rivals on their home turf by adding a stop in Ohio to chase down Gov. John Kasich and scoring an endorsement from Florida's attorney general over home-state Sen. Marco Rubio.As polls show Mr. Rubio on the ropes in his own state, Mr. Trump stumped on Monday in a bellwether county with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, increasing the sting of what he hopes will be a knockout blow in the presidential primary.Mr. Trump also hustled on Monday to Ohio, the other winner-take-all primary, where a victory would speed his drive to win the GOP nomination.Florida and Ohio will allot 165 Republican delegates, a bounty that could give the front-runner an insurmountable lead on the way to the 1,237 needed to clinch the nomination. Mr. Trump currently has 460 delegates, compared with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's 370. Mr. Rubio is in third place with 163 and Mr. Kasich has 63.In the Democratic primary, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is leading in most state polls, also has the potential to put challenger Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the rearview mirror with big victories on Tuesday.With only a slim lead in Ohio polling, Mr. Kasich brought reinforcements Monday in the form of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, signaling the broader attempt by the political establishment to try to hobble the New York businessman.Mr. Cruz's five-stop campaign spree on Monday in Illinois -- which, along with North Carolina and Missouri, will proportionally dole out a total of 193 delegates on Tuesday -- reflected his strategy to siphon enough support to stay in second place. Mr. Cruz has targeted Missouri as his best chance for an upset.In response to a question from a voter in Tampa, Mr. Trump said he was looking forward to suspending his attacks against fellow Republicans and targeting Mrs. Clinton. ""If we win Ohio and if we win Florida, then everybody agrees, every one of these guys, that it's pretty much over,"" said Mr. Trump, who is scheduled to give a post-primary speech Tuesday at his private club in Palm Beach. ""Then I can focus on Hillary, because that's what I really want to focus on. The Republican Party has to come together.""Mr. Trump's opponents are blaming his rhetoric for inciting violence at his rallies -- including one in Chicago that was canceled -- but the New York businessman continued Monday to validate the ""anger"" of his supporters and fault the protesters. A Tampa rally was disrupted several times, including when a man rushed the stage, screaming, ""Donald, you're a fascist!""Outside the rally, protesters were swinging sticks at a pinata that looked like the GOP front-runner.Although Mr. Trump has run a campaign skewering the political establishment, he has picked up support from a small but growing coterie of figures.Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin attended the event in Tampa. ""What we don't have time for is all that petty, punk-ass little thuggery,"" Mrs. Palin told the crowd, referring to Trump protesters.Mr. Trump's rival-turned-surrogate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, joined him at all three campaign events on Monday.Messrs. Rubio and Kasich have recently hesitated over pledging their support to Mr. Trump if he is the nominee, in part because of his handling of the violent clashes at his rallies. Mr. Cruz, who stands the best chance to win over his supporters, set a higher standard for withdrawing his partisan loyalty on Monday.""If for example, he were togo out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, I would not be willing to support Donald Trump,"" Mr. Cruz said on MSNBC.In Ohio, Mr. Romney urged the audience at an airplane museum in Green, Ohio, to vote for Mr. Kasich, though aides to both men said the joint appearance didn't constitute an endorsement.Mr. Romney has emerged as one of the GOP's leading antagonists of Mr. Trump, though he didn't mention the New Yorker on Monday. That restraint dovetailed with Mr. Kasich's efforts to position himself as the most mature and positive candidate.""This country is about coming together . . . not about having fist fights at campaign rallies,"" Mr. Kasich said at an earlier event in Youngstown. ""That's not what America is. I'm not going to take the low road to the highest office in the land.""Both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio, however, are indirectly getting a boost from a multimillion-dollar television blitz by anti-Trump groups.One super PAC run by a former Romney adviser on Monday released a hard-hitting ad featuring women reading aloud offensive comments Mr. Trump has made about other women. The ad begins with ""bimbo,"" ""dog,"" and ""fat pig.""Fighting for his political survival, Mr. Rubio logged 350 miles Monday while making four stops across the state, ending in his hometown of West Miami.In Florida, more than 1.1 million Republicans -- roughly half of the votes expected to be cast overall -- have already voted. That total includes more than 100,000 GOP ballots cast in Mr. Rubio's home base of Miami-Dade County, where he needs to rack up an overwhelming margin to offset a double-digit deficit in statewide polls.""If he wins, it will be because of Miami-Dade,"" said Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Miami.Mr. Kasich is headed Wednesday to Pennsylvania, though a Rubio supporter is challenging his spot on the April 26 ballot in court. He is slated to arrive Friday in Utah.""You will see me pick up steam and have momentum,"" Mr. Kasich told reporters about the Ohio win he expects.---Arian Campo-Flores and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.Credit: By Beth Reinhard, Patrick O'Connor and Reid J.

Election 2016: Florida's Early Voting Points to Trump --- Republican turnout is strong in counties with strong anti- establishment streaks,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773136292?accountid=12768,"MIAMI -- Jeanette Morreal backed Republican Marco Rubio of Florida in his successful U.S. Senate run in 2010, but turned against him for his work on an immigration-overhaul billthree years later.Now, the 76-year-old retiree in Cape Coral, Fla., supports businessman Donald Trump in the GOP presidential race, drawn to his strong stance against illegal immigration and his ability to get things done. ""He understands what the voters feel,"" said Ms. Morreal, who cast a ballot for Mr. Trump last week during Florida's early-voting period and is volunteering for his campaign. ""Nothing is happening in Washington.""Ms. Morreal is part of a surge of early voters in Lee County, a conservative, mostly white stronghold in southwest Florida that could help Mr. Trump win on Tuesdayand boost his chances of securing the nomination.U.S. Census and early-voting data highlight some of the Florida counties worth watching on primary night for clues to whether Mr. Trump will notch the victory that polls are predicting. They include areas of southwest Florida with strong anti-establishment streaks, the central part of the state stocked with disgruntled retirees, and a swath of northern counties that are conservative and more economically challenged, analysts say.By late last week, 28% of the 179,000 registered Republicans in Ms. Morreal's Lee County had already voted, the second-highest rate in the state, according to an analysis by Daniel Smith, a professor at the University of Florida. By comparison, the statewide GOP average was about 15%, he said. Many of them are infrequent voters, a group among whom Mr. Trump has tended to perform well.Data compiled by Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist and expert on Florida politics, show that 27 of Florida's 67 counties were over-performing among GOP early voters as of the weekend, compared with the counties' share of the 2012 GOP primary vote. They include such southeastern counties as Miami-Dade and Broward likely to benefit Mr. Rubio, but also southwestern counties like Lee and Collier that could lift Mr. Trump.Blaise Ingoglia, chairman of the Florida Republican Party, cautions against reading too much into these tallies, because the increases can often be attributed to promotion of early voting by county supervisors of elections. But he said data indicating that large numbers of new or infrequent GOP voters are casting early ballots could benefit the billionaire businessman. ""A lot of it is attributable to Mr. Trump, but not all of it,"" Mr. Ingoglia said.The figures analyzed by Mr. Schale show that in 14 counties, more than half of the early voters didn't cast ballots in the 2012 GOP primary. In 29 counties, including some of the same ones, more than half are infrequent voters who haven't regularly cast ballots in recent primaries for congressional and other seats.One county with a big share of early voters who didn't cast ballots in the 2012 primary is Volusia, which includes Daytona Beach, on the eastern coast. The area is home to Nascar, whose chief executive officer endorsed Mr. Trump, and has many blue-collar workers.Another county featuring a large number of infrequent voters in the early balloting is Pasco, north of Tampa. Because the county typically mirrors the statewide outcome in GOP primaries and reports results quickly, Mr. Trump could have a good night if he is faring well there, Mr. Schale said.It is also worth paying attention to a stretch of counties in the northern part of the state, from Escambia, which includes Pensacola, to Duval, which covers Jacksonville, analysts say. They include many smaller ones that are economically distressed, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Census and economic data.---Dante Chinni contributed to this article.Credit: By Arian Campo-Flores",4/25/16
"Election 2016: Early Voting Likely to Boost Trump, Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768849747?accountid=12768,"Early voting in the Super Tuesday states is likely to give yet another boost to the candidacies of front runners Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to campaign veterans and political scientists.That's because of the characteristics of early voters. The most passionately committed supporters tend to cast their ballots early. African-Americans vote early in disproportionate numbers. And many early voters are wasted because candidates drop out after the voters have cast their ballots. So all the voters who cast absentee ballots for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- a fierce critic of Mr. Trump -- aren't available for other candidates to scoop up.Apply all these factors to the current race, experts say, and the edge goes to the front-runners.In the case of Mr. Trump, his supporters tend to be those who make up their mind early. According to entrance polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina, 58% of Mr. Trump's voters said they decided to cast their votes for him over a month before Election Day. In Nevada, 55% of Trump voters decided at least a week before the election.Early voting gives such voters a way to express their fealty, says University of Florida political scientist Daniel Smith, an early-voting specialist.""Donald Trump may be banking early votes through absentee ballots and early voting,"" he said. ""That's good for Donald Trump, especially if the anti-Trump forces start to coalesce and bring him down.""In Mrs. Clinton's case, her strength with black voters gives her an early-voting edge. On Friday, she spoke at a rally at Atlanta City Hall. After the event, her volunteers phoned voters to get them to cast their ballots that day, the last day of the early-voting period.Among the many unknowns, though, is whether the early votes that a candidate banks before Tuesday will add to the contender's totals or simply shift the day on which the candidate receives the votes he or she was already going to get.Among the Super Tuesday states, Virginia, Alabama and Massachusetts sharply restrict early voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. There, supporters can't cast votes early at a polling station and must provide specific reasons why they need to use absentee ballots. In the rest, residents can either show up and vote, starting a week or two weeks before election days or use absentee ballots without restrictions. In some of the states, voters can do either.The numbers who choose to vote early are large, especially on the Republican side.In Tennessee, nearly 400,000 ballots were cast in the early-voting period, including about 260,000 Republicans -- or roughly half the number of Republicans who voted in the 2008 and 2012 GOP primaries. In Georgia, about 417,000 people have already voted, topping the 2008 record of 271,000. Of those, about 260,000 were Republicans.In Texas, 1.1 million votes were cast in early voting, including about 660,000 Republicans. That is 44% of the 1.5 million GOP votes cast in 2012.Supporters of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz say his large voter-turnout organization can help blunt any advantageHope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said she is ""confident in our GOTV [get out the vote] efforts in Texas and beyond.""In Florida, which votes March 15, early in-person voting started Monday in some counties. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, like Mr. Cruz in Texas, is hoping his home-state advantage and political organization will help blunt Mr. Trump's momentum. But some, perhaps many, absentee ballots were cast for Mr. Bush, making such voters unavailable to Mr. Rubio.Rich Beeson, Mr. Rubio's deputy campaign manager, said he didn't think that would be a big problem. ""People are holding on to their ballots longer than before,"" he said.Credit: By Bob Davis",4/25/16
"Trump, Clinton Seize Leads --- Weekend wins give both the upper hand in amassing delegates in next state contests",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767034250?accountid=12768,"PAHRUMP, Nev. -- Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton emerged from a weekend of voting as the clear leaders in the fight for their parties' presidential nominations, with smoother potential paths to victory than seemed likely a few weeks ago.After winning the South Carolina primary, Mr. Trump should continue to benefit from a splintered Republican field that allows him to rack up convention delegates elsewhere in the South. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton's win in Nevada's caucuses has helped dispel doubts about her candidacy just as it heads on to favorable turf in the South, where she always figured to be stronger than her competitor Sen. Bernie Sanders.Both front-runners still face obstacles. Mr. Trump may soon be hit with more direct attacks, and, as the field winnows, a pair of winner-take-all primaries in March could allow a competitor to make up ground quickly. And Mrs. Clinton faces a rival who has a fervent base of support in some states that lie ahead, while she has lower levels of support than her campaign would like in some pockets of the Democratic electorate.In the short term, though, both will benefit from a primary map that is likely to give them some running room in the delegate hunt.Mr. Trump is expected to win Nevada's Tuesday caucuses, and the state's 30 delegates, and then 12 states vote on Super Tuesday, March 1. Seven of those states are Southern contests that are key to Sen. Ted Cruz's path to victory. But Mr. Trump's convincing victory in South Carolina has put the Texan's proposition that he will be the choice of the region's social conservatives on shaky ground.A total of 989 Republican delegates are at stake between March 1 and March 12, to be awarded proportionally, giving Mr. Trump a chance to build a significant advantage before the start of the winner-take-all primaries March 15. A total of 1,237 delegates are needed to secure the GOP nomination.""If Trump can't be stopped from taking a majority of Super Tuesday delegates it's hard to see how he's not going to be the nominee,"" said Walker Stapleton, the Colorado state treasurer who was co-chairman of Jeb Bush's campaign in Colorado. The former Florida governor dropped out of the race Saturday after a poor showing in South Carolina.A string of losses in the Southern states could be debilitating to Mr. Cruz, the Iowa caucus winner who is jockeying with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to become the primary alternative to Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubio took second place in South Carolina but is under growing pressure to show he can win a state. His home turf, Florida, holds a winner-take-all contest on March 15.Speaking to reporters here Sunday, Mr. Cruz predicted he would defeat Mr. Trump in a one-on-one matchup should the party choose him as the alternative to the businessman.""Donald Trump has demonstrated that he has a relatively high floor of support, but he's also got, I think, a ceiling,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""You've got nearly 70% of Republican primary voters that don't believe Donald is the right person to represent our party in the general election against Hillary Clinton.""Lying in wait outside of the South is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished in fifth place in South Carolina with less than 8% support after his surprise second-place showing in New Hampshire. His campaign is working Massachusetts, another March 1 state, and will need a strong showing in the March 8 Michigan primary to justify his candidacy.Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson took sixth in South Carolina but is remaining in the race.The longer the non-Trump vote is divided four ways, or even split between two candidates, the more delegates Mr. Trump will collect by winning with a plurality of the primary votes rather than a majority.Beyond the map, the rhetoric on the campaign trail has leaned Mr. Trump's way, with most rivals avoiding attacking him so as not to draw his fire.It is a stark difference from 2012, when after Newt Gingrich won South Carolina's primary, the rival Mitt Romney campaign launched a full-scale effort to take down the former House speaker in Florida, the next voting state. Romney surrogates, such as Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, trailed Mr. Gingrich at his events and attacked his record to reporters while the campaign and supportive super PAC peppered the airwaves with TV ads hitting Mr. Gingrich.No campaign has even attempted anything similar to attack Mr. Trump. Mr. Gingrich said Sunday it probably wouldn't work anyway.""You can't have the Romney effect this year,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Nobody can raise enough money, and furthermore, we don't know of any message that works"" against Mr. Trump.Of the roughly $215 million that super PACs have spent so far on advertisements, phone calls and mailers promoting or attacking candidates of both parties, just about $9 million -- or 4% -- has been spent opposing Mr. Trump, who has been leading national polls since July.The biggest hit was from Our Principles PAC, a group created by a former aide to Mr. Romney's 2012 campaign. The group has spent about $3.8 million attacking Mr. Trump, though $3 million of its fundraising has come from two donors: Marlene Ricketts, the wife of TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, and Wisconsin shipping executive Richard Uihlein, according to campaign-finance reports.Mr. Chaffetz, who backs Mr. Rubio, arrived in Nevada on Sunday. But he has no plans to attend Mr. Trump's Las Vegas rally Monday. Instead, the House Oversight Committee chairman drove to Pahrump, a retirement community near the California border, to ""provide oversight"" for Mr. Cruz outside a sports bar where the Texan appeared for a rally.Asked why he isn't trying to distract the front-runner, Mr. Chaffetz replied, ""I don't even know if that's possible with Mr. Trump . . . .If you're a Trump fan, you're a Trump fan.""Clinton campaign officials, for their part, believe the Nevada victory bodes well for the racially diverse set of states that come up next.""Nevada posed the first test for both campaigns in a diverse state -- the first test of whether Sen. Sanders could broaden his appeal. . . .And he came up short,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said.Mr. Sanders said on CNN Sunday that his campaign is gaining support among Hispanic voters. ""I think our message is resonating,"" he said.Delegates are awarded proportionally in the Democratic nomination fight, making it hard for one candidate to clinch the nomination early. But Clinton campaign aides are convinced the former senator and secretary of state is on a path to roll up an insurmountable lead by the end of March.Mrs. Clinton also already has a big lead among superdelegates, a group of Democratic Party officials who will make up about 30% of the total needed to win.One of Mr. Sanders's strengths had appeared to be states that hold caucuses, which typically inspire candidacies that fire up party activists, rather than primaries. Yet Mrs. Clinton has won the two caucus states.""When they articulate their path, when they talk about how they're going to compete for the nomination, they talk about caucus states. We're now 2-0 in caucus states,"" Mr. Fallon said.---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein and Peter Nicholas",4/25/16
America's Moment of Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766953113?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's convincing victory in South Carolina Saturday marks a moment of truth in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. The businessman is now the clear favorite for the Republican nomination, yet he is also the candidate most disliked by GOP voters and according to the polls the least likely to win in November. Are Republicans really going to jump off the cliff into the great Trump unknown?Perhaps so. About a third of GOP voters seem to be confirmed cliff-divers, as Mr. Trump won handily by rolling up a similar share of the vote he won in New Hampshire. He won again across most demographic and ideological groups, especially with those most fed up with Washington and GOP leaders. Mr. Trump should also send a thank-you note to the pope for attacking him, since he won 34% of evangelical Protestant voters who may have resented the Catholic pontiff's ill-conceived intervention.Mr. Trump now heads into Nevada and the March 1 southern primaries with momentum that would typically carry him to the nomination. The difference is that Mr. Trump engenders passionate support and also passionate opposition. His unfavorable ratings are the highest in the GOP field, with a net negative in the most recent WSJ/NBC poll of minus-31. Hillary Clinton is only minus-13.The blustery businessman also doesn't seem all that eager to expand his support. In his victory speech Saturday night, he offered a passing grace note to Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz for doing well but he was mostly self-referential and didn't mention Jeb Bush, who had earlier announced he is leaving the race. Mr. Trump declared that he is leading ""a movement,"" but for that to be true he will have to unify the Republican Party. It still isn't clear what his movement represents other than Mr. Trump's blunt persona, his family and ultimatums to various countries.---The question now is whether the anti-Trump GOP voters can rally around another candidate in time to defeat him. Ted Cruz called himself that candidate, but his third place finish had to be disappointing in a state made for his hard-edged conservatism.Marco Rubio edged him out for second place despite Mr. Cruz's negative ad assault on the Florida Senator. The Texas Senator remains a faction candidate with so far limited appeal across the GOP spectrum, and his Saturday speech (indulgently long as always) doubled down on that strategy. He must figure this is his path to victory in a three-man race.Mr. Rubio was the night's biggest surprise, coming back from fifth place in New Hampshire, and he now has the best chance to emerge as the main challenger to Mr. Trump. Unlike Mr. Cruz he has support across the GOP, and his message is the most likely to appeal to Mr. Bush's voters. Mr. Rubio's speech on Saturday was the shrewdest of the night in its pitch for a 21st-century conservatism that offers opportunity to Americans of all colors, education and income.Messrs. Trump and Cruz will assail Mr. Rubio as soft on immigration, but according to the exit poll some 53% of GOP voters in South Carolina favor a path to citizenship for illegals already in the U.S. Mr. Rubio can let Messrs. Cruz and Trump divide the anti-immigrant vote while he hunts for support with his aspirational message.In a typically classy move, Mr. Bush ended his campaign after finishing fourth and that should help Mr. Rubio. We'll leave the dissection of the Bush campaign to the kick-'em-when-they're-down caucus. Mr. Bush deserves credit for offering policy proposals that are by far the best in the field, but his misfortune was to run in a year when attitude trumps policy. More than a few conservatives may come to regret their gleeful dismissal of Mr. Bush if their nominee hits the rocks in November.The pressure will now build on Ben Carson and John Kasich to get out of the race as well. Mr. Carson can't win and should not want to look like this year's Ron Paul. Mr. Kasich has a strong record as Ohio Governor and is betting that he can break out as the campaign moves to the Midwest starting on March 8 in Michigan. But he has the Cruz problem in reverse: He hasn't shown he can win enough conservative support.---Messrs. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz hope that the GOP aversion to Mr. Trump is strong enough that the New Yorker won't be able to collect a delegate majority. The winner-take-all states don't begin in earnest until March 15, and each of the three thinks that if he can win some of those states he can make a dash for the nomination or deny a majority to Mr. Trump before the July convention.That's not impossible in this bizarre year, but it's more likely that by dividing the non-Trump vote they would abet his nomination. If the businessman can maintain his support in the 35%-range in a multiple-candidate race, he can carry those winner-take-all contests.Mr. Trump has also benefitted from being the target of so few political attacks. Only Mr. Bush took him on during debates, and Mr. Cruz figured that if he slip-streamed Mr. Trump on trade and immigration he'd inherit his voters when the New Yorker dropped out. That now looks like a giant miscalculation as Mr. Trump is trouncing Mr. Cruz as the outsider favorite.The best -- maybe the only -- way to stop Mr. Trump now is if the non-Trump votes consolidate behind a single alternative candidate. After South Carolina that may be Mr. Rubio, who showed resilience and tenacity after his New Hampshire stumble. But he will also have to show he can take on Mr. Trump one-on-one in a way he hasn't done so far.Hillary Clinton's win in Nevada Saturday suggests that in the end Democrats aren't going to indulge their inner socialist this year. They want to win. Republicans have a last chance to reconsider their Trump embrace, or dive head-first into who-knows-what.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Trump Is Overruning the Republican Party"" -- WSJ Feb. 29, 2016)",4/25/16
"Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Clinton Advances, Trump Redefines Normal for the GOP",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766945197?accountid=12768,"Regular order has begun returning for Democrats. Republicans still aren't sure whether their version of regular order even exists any longer.The one thing that was settled as voters spoke Saturday in two states -- Democrats in Nevada and Republicans in South Carolina -- is that there now is no doubt about the identity of the front-runners in the 2016 presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton has re-established herself, as she was always supposed to, as the Democratic favorite. And whether party leaders like it or not, Donald Trump now is indisputably the favorite to win the GOP nomination.Mr. Trump continues to remake both the Republican Party and what a winning coalition within it looks like. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, he enjoyed significant strength among blue-collar, non-college-educated voters in South Carolina. They used to be a GOP afterthought, but increasingly seem to be its core.Meanwhile, there is little consolidation in the anti-Trump lanes, and still too many of them to suit party establishment figures eager to stop Mr. Trump. This is at least a three-man race going forward, with Mr. Trump joined by Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. Technically, for now, it is actually a five-man race, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson hanging around.Only former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush took South Carolina's results as a signal to quit the race. Mr. Kasich should gird himself, though, for he is about to come under enormous pressure to do the same, to allow the anti-Trump vote to consolidate.By the end of Saturday night, the reality was simply this: It isn't clear who is the real alternative to Mr. Trump. South Carolina, with its large population of evangelical Christians, was supposed to be the ideal spot for Mr. Cruz, yet he failed to win. Mr. Rubio made a nice comeback from an embarrassing finish in New Hampshire, but he still hasn't shown that he can actually win anywhere.Big money and big establishment support will be flowing to Mr. Rubio in coming days; the establishment will effectively anoint him the alternative to Mr. Trump. In his post-South Carolina speech, he wrapped himself in the cloak of Ronald Reagan, and hit a generational-change note by declaring that he will lead the ""children of Reagan"" into a new era of conservative power. But it is far from clear that will be enough.For the Democrats, the situation is more simple. Mrs. Clinton didn't win Nevada's caucuses impressively, but she didn't have to. She just had to avoid raising new -- and damaging -- questions about her viability before Democrats vote in South Carolina next week.Mrs. Clinton should win big there, because of a big African-American vote that is the foundation of her candidacy. Her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, nearly conceded that state in his own concession speech.The problem for Mr. Sanders isn't so much South Carolina next Saturday as it is the road that follows. On March 1, Democrats move on to a series of Southern states that simply don't figure to be friendly territory for him. Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia all vote that day, and in each of them the African-American share of the population tops 15%. Texas also rolls in on March 1. A third of that state's population is Hispanic, and that also figures to be a friendly Clinton audience.Less obviously, Nevada suggested one other Clinton asset. Until now, being the establishment choice hasn't been a good thing for much of this election cycle. But it proved to be in Nevada; older, more moderate, mainstream Democratic voters were the ones who showed up in force there for her.Still, Mrs. Clinton continues to face the same problem she has had weighing her down since day one, which is voters' lack of confidence in her honesty and integrity. As Democratic pollster Peter Hart put it to the Journal this past week: ""She is running against herself.""Mr. Sanders has an army of energized supporters and a still-healthy bank account, and states he can win on March 1: Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota and perhaps even Oklahoma. So things are far from decided. But for the Democrats, unlike for Republicans, a return to something resembling normalcy at least seems possible.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",4/25/16
"Pope, Trump Spar on Immigration --- Pontiff says building a wall is 'not Christian;' Trump says questioning faith is 'disgraceful'",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1766256680?accountid=12768,"An extraordinary dispute between Pope Francis and Donald Trump broke out Thursday after the pontiff said the Republican presidential candidate's immigration stands make him ""not Christian,"" prompting Mr. Trump to retort that questioning his personal faith was ""disgraceful.""The exchange began when the pope, an outspoken supporter of immigrants' rights, weighed in on a debate that is at the heart of the Republican primary.In wide-ranging remarks during a news conference aboard his flight back to Rome after a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, the pope also touched on the sensitive topics of birth control and gay marriage. He said the use of contraception could be justified in regions hit by the Zika virus. And when asked if Catholic politicians must vote against same-sex unions, he said they should ""vote according to their well-formed conscience.""In response to a question about Mr. Trump's proposal to build a wall to keep illegal immigrants from entering the U.S., the pope said: ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian."" He added, ""We must see if he said things in that way, and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.""Campaigning in South Carolina before Saturday's primary, Mr. Trump said, ""For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful."" He also suggested the pope had been manipulated by the Mexican government -- a charge officials there denied.Later, in a televised event Thursday night on CNN, Mr. Trump called Pope Francis a ""wonderful guy"" and said ""I don't think this is a fight."" Mr. Trump added he would meet with the Pope ""anytime he wants.""Immigration has been the subject of some of the most heated rhetoric of the Republican campaign and debates, with Mr. Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio all calling for stronger security on the U.S.-Mexico border.In the 2012 general election, about 25% of U.S. voters identified themselves as Catholic, exit polls found. President Barack Obama won 50% of Catholic voters, who included many Hispanics, and 48% backed Republican candidate Mitt Romney.In South Carolina, the key GOP voting bloc is not Catholics but evangelicals, with about 65% of Republican voters identifying as born-again or evangelical in 2012 exit polls. This election cycle, Mr. Trump won the majority of evangelicals in New Hampshire and Mr. Cruz won them in Iowa.Joanna Horres, a homemaker who led the crowd in pro-Trump chants at the event in Kiawah Island, S.C., said she has backed him since he declared he would run for president, and she still does. ""It makes my opinion of him even stronger,"" she said. ""He's not afraid to speak up to anybody, even the pope. He's obviously a Christian who is secure in his salvation; he doesn't need the approval of the pope either,"" she said.Mr. Trump's opponents tried to steer clear of the controversy on the campaign trail on Thursday. ""Listen, that's between Donald and the pope. I'm not going to get in the middle of that,"" Mr. Cruz said, declining to take questions about the matter.Mr. Rubio said the U.S. has the right to control who comes into the U.S. and when and how people do that. ""There's a balance here between being compassionate and also being responsible, especially in a world where, today, radical jihadists are seeking to use the immigration laws of countries to infiltrate killers and fighters into foreign countries,"" Mr. Rubio said on CNN.Mr. Trump is no stranger to controversial comments, but his clash with the pope raises new stakes and moves both men into uncharted waters.John C. Green, an expert on religion and politics at the University of Akron, said the moment is unprecedented. Religious leaders sometimes criticize politicians' policies and ideas, but he said he couldn't recall a time when a leader leveled a personal broadside.""It's not that uncommon for religious leaders to argue with politicians over politics, where a Catholic leader might say so-and-so's position on abortion or climate change is not consistent with the church's teachings. But I've never seen anything like this,"" he said. Conversely, he said, when a politician comes in for criticism from a religious leader, he or she typically simply acknowledges a disagreement. ""It's not a confrontational reaction,"" said Mr. Green.In his comments Thursday, Mr. Trump told the crowd that he is a Christian ""and proud of it."" He suggested that the pope, whom he has previously called ""political,"" was unduly influenced by the Mexican government and saw only ""one side"" of the story. ""He said negative things about me because the Mexican government convinced him that Trump is not a good guy,"" Mr. Trump said.A spokesman for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said Mr. Trump's proposal for a border wall was not a subject that came up in talks between the pontiff and Mr. Pena Nieto.Mr. Trump, a Presbyterian, also re-aired a dire prediction he had made last year: that the Vatican is a top target for Islamic State terrorists, and he would be the best commander in chief to keep it safe.""If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which, as everyone knows, is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would've only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would've been president,"" he said Thursday.Mr. Trump has drawn particular ire from critics over his call for deporting millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and his labeling of Mexican immigrants as drug traffickers and rapists.In interviews after the rally, about a dozen Trump supporters said the businessman's forceful rebuke bolstered their support for him.Larry DiCenzo, a retired school principal who lives in Charleston, said he was shocked the pope would criticize Mr. Trump's religion. Mr. DiCenzo, a Catholic, said the feud wouldn't change the way he voted on Saturday.""I liked Trump's response, it was to the point, which is the reason why I like Trump, because he says it as it is, and he is truthful,"" Mr. DiCenzo said. ""It astounds me that [the pope] would say that and I disagree with him.""Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., a Trump supporter, told CNN on Thursday that the pope's comments went too far. ""Jesus never intended to give instructions to political leaders on how to run a country,"" Mr. Falwell said.Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, a Mexican immigrant who has publicly pushed for changes to U.S. immigration law, declined to comment on the pope's words or Mr. Trump's reaction, because he hadn't read the full transcript of the pope's remarks.But the archbishop said: ""If you follow the Bible, you have to be open to people migrating. The Bible says clearly you have to welcome the stranger.""Some Mexicans said they were grateful the pope spoke out. ""Is there a more hated person in the world right now than Donald Trump?"" asked Oscar Tello, 31, a tennis coach in Mexico City. ""I'm glad the pope pointed out that Mr. Trump is not acting like a Christian.""---Laura Meckler, Tamara Audi and David Luhnow contributed to this article.Credit: By Francis X.

Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Trump Bid Changing Philosophy of the GOP,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774739994?accountid=12768,"While focus shifts to whether Donald Trump can sew up the Republican nomination by the party convention in July, less attention is being devoted to a potentially bigger question: What will the party that gathers then actually stand for?Neither question will be easy to resolve. The efforts by some Republican leaders to block Mr.Trump continue apace, and he could fall short of winning enough delegates to claim the nomination by convention time. That would produce the much-discussed, potentially raucous contested convention.Yet the charge by Mr. Trump and his supporters isn't merely an attempt to win the nomination; it's also an effort to change what the party is about. It represents an attempt at a hostile takeover that, if successful, would change not only who leads the GOP, but also what it means to be a Republican.How, for example, would a party that traditionally has stood for free trade alter its position if its nominee has espoused punitive tariffs on imports from China? How does a party whose members have declared religious liberty a core issue square that belief with a nominee who has called for surveillance of mosques?These positions would require re-evaluation of some basic Republican doctrines. They represent changes that, as Mr. Trump has been saying, could draw new members into the Republican Party -- but also could drive away some Republicans who can't abide the new direction.The tension was on display Monday in Washington, as Mr. Trump met privately to woo a group of Republican officials. One way to grasp the significance of the moment is to stack Trump positions of today alongside those contained in the party platform that was approved at the Republicans convention four years ago.Party platforms aren't documents that people pay a lot of close attention to once they are written and approved. Still, they provide a useful baseline for the positions that define a national party.For example, Mr. Trump has in Republican debates emphatically defended the use of eminent domain -- the practice by which governments can forcibly take over private property to clear the way for public or private development projects. Indeed, he has defended his own real-estate company's use of the practice.Conservatives dislike the idea, though, and it will be hard to square fulsome support for eminent domain with this passage from the 2012 Republican platform:""The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment -- 'nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation' -- is a bulwark against tyranny; for without property rights, individual rights are diminished. That is why we deplore the Supreme Court's Kelo v. New London decision, allowing local governments to seize a person's home or land, not for vital public use, but for transfer to private developers.""Four years ago, the party stood behind what was then the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Pacific Rim nations.Today, Mr. Trump, along with some other Republican presidential contenders, has rejected the trade deal President Barack Obama completed, arguing that the U.S. has been taken to the cleaners not just in that deal but in other free-trade agreements as well. Meantime, Mr. Trump told the Washington Post and CNN on Monday that he questions whether the U.S. can afford the money it is spending for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance, which the 2012 platform said was important for the ""continued vitality"" of relations with Europe.The platform also is peppered with references to the importance of freedom of religion. In its opening section, for example, it says Republicans ""ask all to join us in rejecting the forces of hatred and bigotry and in denouncing all who practice or promote racism, anti-Semitism, ethnic prejudice, or religious intolerance"" and refers to ""our reverence for the religious freedom envisioned by the Founding Fathers of our nation and of our party.""That stands in juxtaposition with Mr. Trump's plan for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, his call for surveillance of some mosques in the U.S., and his statement that he would ""strongly consider"" shutting down some mosques.Mr. Trump has argued that, in an age of Islamic terrorism, positions and practices have to change -- and his many supporters emphatically agree. In other areas, such as abortion, Mr. Trump has adjusted his views to hew to Republican orthodoxy.More broadly, though, his positions on questions such as his call for expelling millions of illegal immigrants envision a powerful central government, in a party that has traditionally favored limiting federal powers.As such positions suggest, a Trump nomination would represent not just a change in leadership, but also a change in Republican philosophy.Credit: By Gerald F.

Election 2016: Trump Voices Israel Support --- GOP front-runner seeks to allay doubts over his backing for Jewish state,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774739993?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump sought to present a more sober and measured profile Monday, as he spoke before one of the largest pro-Israel groups in the U.S.""I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel,"" he told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. ""I'm a newcomer to politics, but not to backing the Jewish state.""Mr. Trump, who typically speaks off the cuff or from brief notes, read from a prepared text, and eschewed the harsh, sometimes profane rhetoric that he has often employed on the campaign trail.The New York businessman used his address -- drafted by his Jewish son-in-law -- to try to allay doubts about his support for Israel and about his mastery of foreign policy, addressing a group that included many skeptics not just of his foreign policy, but of his provocative campaign style.He launched a blunt critique of the U.S. nuclear deal with Iran. ""I know deal-making, and let me tell you this deal is catastrophic,"" he said.Despite threats of protests, the crowd appeared largely receptive to Mr. Trump, save for a few moments. He received several rounds of cheers, with some standing to applaud him, when he said that Israel would no longer be treated like a ""second-class citizen"" and when he criticized the deal with Iran.But he drew some titters when he said that no one had studied the Iran deal more than him -- ""believe me.""Having drawn fire last year for giving an ambiguous response on a key litmus-test issue, Mr. Trump also told the audience: ""We will move the American Embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.""Mr. Trump's prior insults to women and minorities had prompted protests from rabbis and other critics who threatened to walk out or boycott the address. Some attendees, wearing stickers that read ""Come together against hate"" -- a play off of Aipac's theme, ""Come Together"" -- planned to walk out before he began speaking, while protesters gathered outside.Daniel Burg, a rabbi from Baltimore who was attending Aipac this week for the ninth year in a row, was among the attendees who walked out. ""People are exercising their rights to not simply abide the presence of Mr. Trump and pretend that this election cycle is business as usual,"" he said. He called the real-estate billionaire's rhetoric ""so hateful, so misogynistic, so racist"" and said it had ""undermined the democracy that we believe in.""Rick Jacobs, a rabbi from New York City and president of the Union for Reform Judaism, helped author a letter to Mr. Trump requesting a meeting to discuss the community's concerns with the front-runner, citing his comments about Mexican immigrants, women, Muslims, and other groups.Mr. Jacobs said the campaign has said it is considering setting up a meeting later this week. ""It's not that we won't engage with this candidate,"" he said. ""We want to have a chance not just to listen -- we want to have a chance to speak.""Mr. Jacobs walked out ahead of Mr. Trump's speech and gathered with about 70 others outside the auditorium while Mr. Trump speaking. He said he saw hundreds leaving the stadium before Mr. Trump took the stage.Mr. Trump has also been making efforts to communicate with the GOP's more conventional power centers. Earlier Monday, he met with several members of Congress, most of whom already support his campaign but a few who haven't yet endorsed him.Also Monday, in an interview with the Washington Post editorial board, he unveiled a partial list of his foreign-policy advisers, a week after drawing criticism for saying he is his own best adviser when it comes to international affairs. The group didn't appear to belong to a specific camp within the foreign-policy establishment.In addition to Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama who has endorsed Mr. Trump, the team included Walid Phares, a Middle East expert and critic of President Barack Obama; Joe Schmitz, a former inspector general at the Defense Department; and Carter Page, a founder and managing partner at Global Energy Capital, a New York firm.In his Washington Post interview, Mr. Trump broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy on another front when he questioned the need for American involvement in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is often used against Russia as a unified defense coalition. Mr. Trump suggested that the U.S. contributed too much money to NATO and said that European countries should shoulder more of the cost.Oana Lungescu, chief spokeswoman for NATO, said the alliance doesn't comment on election campaigns in allied countries.In his Aipac speech, Mr. Trump, who promised at the outset that he hadn't come to ""pander to you about Israel,"" made several overtures to the audience. He concluded by telling them, ""My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby,"" and received a loud round of cheers.Credit: By Janet Hook and Rebecca Ballhaus",4/26/16
The Zero-Sum Worlds of Trump and Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774469619?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders might seem unlikely economic soul mates, but they share a mistaken reliance on zero-sum thinking and long-discredited economic policies.Mr. Trump's anti-immigration and anti-trade positions make him essentially a disciple of mercantilism -- a protectionist economic theory refuted by Adam Smith in 1776. Bernie Sanders proudly calls himself a socialist and advocates vast increases in taxes and government power. The history of the past century, from the Soviet Union's fall to the impending collapse of Venezuela, amply shows that a socialist economy isn't only ""rigged"" -- to borrow one of Mr. Sanders's favorite words -- it doesn't work.Messrs. Trump and Sanders have been led astray by zero-sum thinking, or the assumption that economic magnitudes are fixed when they are in fact variable.If the world is zero-sum, then the number of jobs is fixed, as is gross domestic product. In Mr. Trump's mind, if there are more Mexican workers in the U.S., then American workers must lose their jobs. In the real, positive-sum world where Mr. Trump doesn't live, Mexican workers also consume, thus increasing GDP and creating new jobs.Moreover, the reason that firms hire immigrant workers is to lower costs, and this leads to lower prices for consumers, allowing them to purchase additional goods -- adding new jobs to the U.S. economy. But in a fixed world prices do not change, so this effect is ignored.Similar arguments apply to Mr. Trump's analysis of Chinese imports. In a world of fixed GDP and prices, imports of goods from China merely replace goods that otherwise would have been produced by American workers. In the real world, imports reduce prices and increase GDP, so workers, who are also consumers, benefit from imports of lower-cost goods and increase their consumption of other goods.Mr. Sanders's economics is also zero-sum, although he emphasizes a different aspect of the fallacy. In a zero-sum world, taxes don't matter much because people work the same amount anyway, so there are no losses from reduced effort in response to higher taxes. Similarly, in a zero-sum world methods of production are given, so there are no responses to changing prices -- higher minimum wages don't lead to layoffs, for example. (In the real world, we saw Wal-Mart's recent store closings following wage increases.) In the Bernie Sanders universe, the size of the economy is fixed so there is plenty to redistribute no matter how misguided the economic policies.Zero-sum thinking persists because it is superficially appealing. Mr. Trump's policies would in theory benefit Americans and increase jobs. Mr. Sanders's policies would make the poor better off. In the actual, positive-sum world we live in, their policies -- building a fence along the Mexican border, disrupting labor markets by deporting millions of productive workers, huge tariffs on imported goods, much higher income taxes and minimum wages -- would, if adopted, lead to an economic depression that would make the 1930s look prosperous.---Mr. Rubin, an economics professor at Emory University and a senior fellow at the Classical Liberal Institute at New York University, is the author of ""Darwinian Politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom"" (Rutgers Press, 2002).(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Candidates' Zero-Sum Worldview Is Wrong"" -- WSJ Mar. 26, 2016)Credit: By Paul H.

Election 2016: Trump's Speech to Jewish Lobby Prompts Protests,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774469106?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Protests of Donald Trump's address to the country's leading pro-Israel lobby on Monday notably have little to do with his foreign policy, although that raises concerns, too.The opposition to the GOP presidential front-runner's speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington primarily focuses on his comments about women, immigrants, Muslims and the disabled.""To be honest, I am not sure anyone is sure whether he has a clear, coherent policy regarding the Middle East,"" said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism. ""We take deep offense over his discourse, which is at odds with our beliefs as a Jewish community and as Americans.""The group is among several scattered Jewish organizations, synagogues and student associations denouncing Mr. Trump before Aipac's conference. Hundreds of people plan to boycott Mr. Trump's speech, walk out after he is introduced or rebuke him.Mr. Trump's Republican challengers, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton are also scheduled to address Aipacon Monday. Mrs. Clinton's rival, Bernie Sanders, the only Jewish candidate, declined an invitation to speak.An Aipac spokesman said all active presidential candidates were invited and declined to comment on security surrounding Mr. Trump's speech or potential repercussions from any protests.Mr. Trump has repeatedly defended his inflammatory rhetoric -- including his description of Mexican immigrants as criminals and his call for a ban on Muslim immigrants -- as grounded in national-security concerns.He has also promoted himself as the most pro-Israel candidate in the Republican primary, an assertion disputed by Messrs. Cruz and Kasich. ""If people want to hear about Mr. Trump's vision to have strong relations with Israel, then they may want to stay and listen to his remarks at Aipac,"" said Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. ""Mr. Trump has a long record of supporting Israel.""But the protests have more to do with what critics see as Mr. Trump's xenophobia and bigotry. They alsoblame him for inciting violence at his rallies and threatening ""riots"" if he is denied the nomination at a contested convention.One new group of rabbis and other Jewish leaders, Come Together Against Hate, condemns ""the ugliness that Mr. Trump espouses"" and plans to distribute stickers and fliers.The group is encouraging people to skip the speech or to quietly walk out.Rabbi Jeffrey Salkin of Temple Solel in Hollywood, Fla., is urging people to simply avoid the speech so as not to be disruptive and risk being expelled from the lobbying group. ""Walking out would mean being ejected from Aipac, and it would add to Mr. Trump's narrative,"" he said.The last time Mr. Trump spoke before a major Jewish group he drew heckles.In that address, before the Republican Jewish Coalition in December, he was booed for refusing to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and questioning Israel's commitment to a peace deal. Jerusalem's status is a key sticking point in negotiations with the Palestinians. Israel proclaims Jerusalem as its capital but the U.S. and other countries have embassies in Tel Aviv.Mr. Trump also played to Jewish stereotypes, suggesting his audience was wealthy and praising them for their presumed negotiating prowess.Mr. Trump has drawn praise from white supremacists, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. He hesitated in television interviews last month when asked about Mr. Duke but later said he disavowed his support.At the Aipac conference, policy contrasts are expected between the Republican candidates. Mr. Trump's rivals have criticized him for saying he plans to be ""neutral"" while trying to negotiate a peace deal in the Middle East.""I don't think we need a commander in chief who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel,"" Mr. Cruz said in the latest GOP debate.Mr. Kasich said, ""Idon't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do.""Mr. Trump said he was the most pro-Israel candidate on the debate stage. ""I was the grand marshal, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day parade down Fifth Avenue,"" he said. ""I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK?""Credit: By Beth Reinhard",4/26/16
GOP Chief Sees Long Fight Over Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774469105?accountid=12768,"The head of the Republican National Committee braced the party faithful Sunday for what could be the first contested nominating convention in generations, suggesting increasing odds of a showdown this summer over Donald Trump's candidacy.While Mr. Trump has a big lead in convention delegates, many party elders and strategists, alarmed over his ascent, are redoubling efforts to deny him the nomination. At the least, they are seeking to force a battle at the July convention in Cleveland. In multiple television interviews Sunday, Reince Priebus, chairman of the RNC, raised the prospect of a protracted convention fight with multiple rounds of voting needed to determine the winner.""We're preparing for that possibility,"" Mr. Priebus said on ABC. That marks a shift from earlier this month, when Mr. Priebus told a gathering of conservatives that a contested convention was ""highly, highly unlikely.""The GOP chairman acknowledged a convention fight could lead to the selection of a nominee who fell well short in the primary voting, but he stressed there is ""nothing nefarious"" about that. Mr. Trump has warned against efforts to deny him the nomination.Mr. Priebus's efforts to tamp down unease over a convention fight come as the campaign moves into a much slower and more grueling phase. Voters will weigh in Tuesday in Arizona and Utah, and on April 5 in Wisconsin, but then the campaign will wait two weeks until the New York primary.Of the three remaining Republican candidates, only Mr. Trump has a feasible path to winning the nomination outright. And even that is a tough road. The New Yorker needs to win 57% of the remaining delegates to accrue the 1,237 needed for the nomination. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz must take 83% of remaining delegates, while it is mathematically impossible for Ohio Gov. John Kasich to clear the threshold.Through Sunday, Mr. Trump had 678 delegates. Mr. Cruz stood in second place with 423, and Mr. Kasich had 143.The front-runner will need to perform far better than he has to date in states that award delegates proportionally or become winner-take-all if a candidate wins 50% or more. Mr. Trump said Sunday he was confident he could win the nomination outright but said his supporters were key to the party's chances of winning in November.""The biggest story in all of politics are the millions of people that are coming out to vote for me,"" including Democrats and independents, he said on ABC. Should another candidate win the nomination, he said, ""you're going to have a lot of very unhappy people. And I think, frankly, for the Republicans to disenfranchise all those people, because if that happens, they're not voting and the Republicans lose.""At a campaign stop Sunday in Arizona, Mr. Cruz said Mr. Trump likely wouldn't pull in more than 40% of the vote in the remaining primaries and caucuses. He expressed confidence he could win enough of the remaining contests to clinch the nomination before the convention, despite trailing in delegate count.""With each candidate that has dropped out of the race, Donald's position has gotten weaker and our position has gotten stronger,"" Mr. Cruz said.The GOP last had a contested convention in 1976, when President Gerald Ford defeated Ronald Reagan on the first ballot. The last time the party needed multiple ballots to select a nominee was 1948, when New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey prevailed.It remains far from clear whether the myriad campaigns to stop Mr. Trump will gather sufficient momentum. Several super PACs and independent groups are running paid anti-Trump ads and are in regularcommunication, though there are scant signs so far of significant coordination.About two dozen operatives, elected officials, donors and Republican activists met in Washington last week to discuss how best to stop Mr. Trump. The group also considered the possibility of a third-party bid, though a person in the meeting said the consensus was to first try to stop him at the convention. Some officials believe a third-party candidate would only clear a path for the Democrat to win by splitting the GOP vote.""There are a number of people who are trying to identify what the best path is to stopping Trump,"" said Tim Miller, an adviser to Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump political-action committee, who previously worked for Jeb Bush's presidential campaign.The path for a new third-party conservative bid is exceedingly narrow:Any group would face a steep challenge to get on 50 state ballots.""Our best evidence was that unless you started by March 15, you weren't going to get on enough ballots,"" said Doug Schoen, an adviser to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who recently said he was giving up any thought of a 2016 presidential run.The search for ballot access has led some Republicans to look toward the Libertarian Party, which has gained access to 31 states and expects to be on all state ballots by the fall.""The interest in what we are doing has certainly grown,"" said Nicholas Sarwark, chairman of the party's national committee, adding that the Libertarian convention in May would be open and fully contested, though former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson appears to be the favorite.Still, Mr. Sarwark said he doubted that delegates at the party's convention would smile upon ""someone with a lot of money or name recognition"" trying to secure the Libertarian nomination at the last minute.Former Republican House SpeakerNewt Gingrich, who has praised Mr. Trump but stopped short of endorsing him, is one of many conservatives trying to tamp down any talk of a third-party candidate. ""If they want to form the 'Let's Elect Hillary Clinton club,' fine. But they ought to be honest about it,"" he said last week on Fox News.Both Messrs. Kasich and Cruz, meanwhile, are building their strategy around the possibility of a fight in Cleveland.Mr. Kasich said a contested convention would help the party choose the nominee best positioned to win in November. ""What's everybody so panicked about? Everybody needs to take a little chill pill,"" Mr. Kasich said on CNN.---Reid J.

Election 2016: Trump Could Take Stand in School Trial,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774293365?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and his real-estate school are headed toward a potentially unprecedented trial this year that could feature the Republican presidential front-runner taking the stand, barring a surprise ruling from a New York state judge or a last-minute settlement.Justice Cynthia Kern could decide in a hearing in April whether to hold a trial over allegations by the New York Attorney General that Trump University fraudulently bilked students out of a collective $40 million. Mr. Trump is a defendant in the case.The attorney general's office is preparing for the prospect of a trial this year, a person familiar with the matter said. If Justice Kern follows normal procedure, the trial would come later this year, say legal experts.Such a move could thrust Trump University, which political opponents have used to attack Mr. Trump, in the courtroom in the middle of a contentious presidential election. Mr. Trump is leading the Republican field of candidates.A fraud trial involving a major party's candidate for president during an election would be unprecedented. Raising the stakes further for Mr. Trump: The businessman is likely to be called to testify by the attorney general, according to a person familiar with the matter, a development that would pull him from the campaign trail to answer questions while under oath.A trial appears likely, but isn't certain. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has asked Justice Kern to rule on the case without a trial, arguing there are no factual disputes left to resolve. Justice Kern previously denied one such request from Mr. Schneiderman, but the attorney general renewed it after submitting additional evidence. The two sides could also reach a settlement, though Mr. Trump has said publicly that he won't settle.The judge has scheduled a hearing for April 26 to discuss Mr. Schneiderman's request. A trial, if it happens, would be without a jury. Justice Kern would determine the outcome.A lawyer for Mr. Trump didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has denied the allegations and has accused Mr. Schneiderman of ""gross incompetence"" and of ""wasting millions in taxpayer money"" with the probe.""We look forward to pursuing our claims against Mr. Trump in court on behalf of the people he defrauded,"" said Matt Mittenthal, spokesman for the attorney general.Mr. Schneiderman filed a civil lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump University in 2013 alleging that it exploited Mr. Trump's celebrity status to persuade people to enroll in expensive courses that failed to deliver on their promises. Trump University defrauded more than 5,000 students in New York out of thousands of dollars each, according to the complaint, by billing itself as a real-estate school and charging students as much as $35,000 without having proper licensing.Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, is the only attorney general to have pursued a case against Trump University. Greg Abbott, former Texas attorney general and now the state's Republican governor, investigated the school in 2010 for violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, according to a civil investigative demand sent to Trump University. Mr. Abbott never sued Mr. Trump. The office has previously declined to comment about the probe.Mr. Trump is also facing legal proceedings related to Trump University in a lawsuit in federal court in San Diego brought by former students who claim they were defrauded. The judge presiding over that case indicated in a hearing this month that he was considering delaying a trial until after the election. Mr. Trump's lawyers have said he couldn't get a fair trial in that case because of the ""poisoned"" environment, referring to the election.Justice Kern ruled in 2014 that Trump University never obtained licenses, holding him personally liable. She has yet to determine the damages Mr. Trump must pay. But she dismissed one of two fraud claims Mr. Schneiderman brought, ruling the statute of limitations had passed, and that a trial was needed on the other claim.A New York state appeals court this month reinstated the dropped claim, allowing Mr. Schneiderman to move ahead with both fraud claims.The attorney general could call Mr. Trump as a witness. Mr. Trump could invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself if his testimony had the potential to expose him to criminal charges, but Justice Kern could hold that against him in her deliberations, legal experts said.Credit: By Christopher M.

Clinton Coalition Takes Aim At Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774134751?accountid=12768,"Pro-Democratic groups are launching an orchestrated bid to weaken GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump ahead of a potential November showdown with Hillary Clinton, while her campaign readies a strategy of engaging the billionaire businessman on issues without trading insults.A coalition of 22 liberal groups -- including some that have endorsed Mrs. Clinton and others that back her Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders -- have united behind a campaign to stop Mr. Trump.Among their plans: anti-Trump demonstrations, possibly including protests at the Republican National Convention this summer in Cleveland, and marches in major cities.""So far, Trump has bounced around the country speaking to people in these stadium rallies, and we haven't seen massive marches outside the rallies,"" said Ben Wikler, Washington director for Moveon.org, which is leading the coalition.A spokesman for Mr. Trump predicted that such efforts would backfire.""What you find with Donald Trump is he's a counter-puncher,"" Corey Lewandowski, the Trump campaign manager, said in an interview on Thursday. ""Someone punches him and he punches back, and he punches back much harder. That's what the Republican field has come to realize.""Although Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton haven't clinched their parties' nominations, the two are on a path to face off in November, based on large leads in delegates. The former secretary of state has the clearest route, while Mr. Trump still faces obstacles in amassing enough delegates to clinch the nomination. Should he fall short, he also must confront the prospect of a contested Republican convention in July.A newcomer to politics, Mr. Trump has shown himself to be a skillful campaigner whose attacks on GOP opponents have helped fuel his rise.A Clinton aide said her campaign has carefully monitored how Republican rivals have sought to blunt Mr. Trump's momentum, veering from ignoring him to trading personal insults with him, never with much impact.The Democratic front-runner's aides are planning to keep her out of a war of insults, concluding that independent voters will recoil at Mr. Trump's heated rhetoric and reward her discretion. Their plan is to try to challenge Mr. Trump on substance, the Clinton aide said.""I think that she has to be above it all,"" said Alan Patricof, a Clinton fundraiser. ""To me, running against a bully, an egotist, a screamer, is a very difficult challenge, because you can't deal with a person like this in a normal fashion.""Mr. Trump's supporters often cite his demeanor as a refreshing change from scripted politics.Apart from the Clinton campaign itself, liberal activists, labor unions and pro-Clinton super PACS are girding to spend tens of millions of dollars to try to weaken Mr. Trump. After months spent digging into his business dealings and monitoring his speeches, these groups are stepping up plans to try to discredit him in the eyes of voters.One pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA Action, released a video on Wednesday that sought to cast doubt on Mr. Trump's foreign-policy acumen. The AFL-CIO this week put out ads on Facebook and Twitter that aim to weaken Mr. Trump's appeal to working-class voters, depicting him as a foe of organized labor.Major women's groups, including NARAL Pro-Choice America and Emily's List, are also plotting anti-Trump campaigns, in addition to pro-Clinton organizing that was in the works no matter who the Republicans nominate.A senior Democrat who has spoken with Clinton campaign officials and others in the party in recent days said the multi-pronged strategy under review includes enlisting the Muslim, Hispanic and gay communities in an effort to paint Mr. Trump as a divisive force in American politics.A pair of super PACs loyal to Mrs. Clinton have already accumulated a vast trove of research on Mr. Trump's business dealings. Using financial experts, Correct the Record and American Bridge have dug into his business career and pored over his personal-disclosure forms looking for material to exploit in a general election.The groups haven't released any of this research as the GOP primaries have unfolded. They didn't want to assist Mr. Trump's GOP rivals, whom they believed would give Mrs. Clinton a tougher challenge in November, according to a person familiar with their work. Now, they will look for an opportune time to try to put Mr. Trump on the defensive.Separately, Priorities USA has been preparing for a potential candidacy by Mr. Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz since the summer. The group has conducted focus groups and polling on Mr. Trump and other potential opponents.Having raised $50 million through January, Priorities USA is planning several lines of attack against the Republican front-runner. It will try to draw attention to his temperament, his treatment of women and his suitability as commander in chief, as well as his business dealings, said a person familiar with its plans.Taking aim at Mr. Trump's statements about women poses risks, as Mrs. Clinton discovered when she faulted his use of a vulgar Yiddish term in December. Referring to his remark that she got ""schlonged"" by Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump has ""a penchant for sexism."" Mr. Trump quickly invoked former President Bill Clinton's history with women, including his impeachment for allegedly lying about his affair with a White House intern. That retort ended the back-and-forth.""He punched back at her 10 times harder, and you don't hear that talk anymore,"" said Mr. Lewandowski. ""She understood that he was not, quote-unquote, a typical politician.""Mrs. Clinton's allies say they see no advantage in Mrs. Clinton taking part in a slugfest with Mr. Trump. Still, they say they are prepared to step into a fray.""There are things that a campaign won't want to do that need to get done,"" said David Brock, the founder of both Correct the Record and American Bridge. ""They'll need a lot of surrogates to say things you don't want the candidate saying.""Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler",4/26/16
Election 2016: Foreign-Policy Plans Get Sharper Focus --- Trump plays advisers close to vest; Cruz releases list of 23 security experts,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774134736?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsAlvin Krongard is a former executive director of the Central Intelligence Agency. An Election 2016 article Friday about Republican candidates' foreign-policy plans incorrectly called him a former head of the agency. Also, Sen. Jeff Sessions was incorrectly identified as a U.S. representative.(WSJ March 22, 2016)Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump continues to hedge questions about his foreign-policy team even as the advisers to his two challengers are coming into sharper focus.Meanwhile, some of Mr. Trump's stances on Russia and the Middle East are causing concern in a diplomatic corps stunned by his rise.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign on Thursday released the names of 23 national security advisers, including conservative veterans of U.S. and British foreign-policy circles. Among them: former Reagan White House adviser Elliott Abrams, former National Security Agency general counsel Stewart Baker, and former Missouri Sen. Jim Talent, who served on the armed services committee.Ohio Gov. John Kasich previously disclosed more than 30 national security experts consulting with his campaign, including former Nixon National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen and Alvin Krongard, a former head of the Central Intelligence Agency.Mr. Trump, by contrast, has announced only one national security adviser -- Alabama Rep. Jeff Sessions. On Monday, he said the person he counts on the most is himself.""I'm speaking with myself No. 1 because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things,"" he said in an interview on MSNBC. ""I talk to a lot of people and at the appropriate time I'll tell you who the people are.""Pressed on who was giving Mr. Trump advice, Mr. Sessions said Thursday, ""A lot of these are private conversations as other candidates are having. Does anybody know who Kasich's advisory team is or Ted Cruz's for that matter?""Mr. Cruz released the names of his team a few hours later. The list includes Frank J. Gaffney, identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as ""one of America's most notorious Islamophobes."" He served as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under President Ronald Reagan. The Cruz campaign didn't immediately return a request for comment.The candidates' foreign-policy views will face increased scrutiny next week when they address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Washington's most powerful pro-Israel lobby.Messrs. Cruz and Kasich are forming growing coteries of advisers as they woo supporters of two ex-rivals who emphasized their foreign-policy credentials. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who bowed out of the race Tuesday, and former Florida Sen. Jeb Bush, who quit last month, were backed by dozens of defense hawks who helped shape their views on Russia, China, Iran, and Israel in line with party orthodoxy.Mr. Trump's positions, many still unformed, often break with GOP tradition but appear to be resonating with voters who say U.S. diplomatic and trade agreements cater to foreign interests.He has proposed engaging in trade fights with Mexico and China, demanding higher payments for military protection from Japan, Germany, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, and taking oil from Iraq.He also has urged caution toward intervening in the Middle East, saying the U.S. shouldn't have supported the ousting of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. Mr. Trump has given mixed signals on whether U.S. ground forces should be sent to fight Islamic State.""Trump's instincts I think have been proven right,"" Mr. Sessions said Thursday at a forum sponsored by the American Council for Capital Formation, an economic and environmental policy group. ""I think his emphasis on a more realistic, pragmatic foreign policy is good.""Mr. Sessions defended Mr. Trump's call to reset relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I think an argument can be made that there's no reason for the U.S. and Russia to be at this loggerheads,"" Mr. Sessions said.But some diplomats in Washington are voicing concerns about what they view as Mr. Trump's xenophobic and contradictory remarks on foreign policy.European officials are raising questions about the fealty Mr. Trump has paid to Mr. Putin, while Arab diplomats are alarmed by Mr. Trump's statements that Islam hates America and his call for a ban on Muslim immigrants.A senior Arab official said Mr. Trump's comments have been offensive but the bigger surprise -- and disappointment -- is that he is winning.The U.S. and Russia have a strained, combative relationship stretching back decades.""In a fantasy world of foreign policy, we could be good friends with Putin,"" said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Principles get in the way of cozying up with dictators. So does information. But Mr. Trump has found a way around that. He simply has none.""---Jay Solomon contributed to this article.Credit: By Damian Paletta and Beth Reinhard",4/26/16

On Thursday the businessman demanded an apology after we -- ""the dummies at the @WSJ Editorial Board"" -- accurately noted that Hillary Clinton has received about a million more votes than he has. The truth hurts, though Mr. Trump would rather walk down Fifth Avenue shooting the messenger.Mr. Trump says his numbers can't be compared to Mrs. Clinton's because ""she had only 3 opponents -- I had 16."" Actually his rise has been cleared by the large and fractured GOP field. Of the 20.35 million GOP primary votes cast so far, he has received 7.54 million, or a mere 37%. Despite the media desire to call him unstoppable, Mr. Trump is the weakest Republican front-runner since Gerald Ford in 1976.After Reagan, George H.W. Bush in 1988, Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000 romped to nomination victories with only minor early setbacks. Mitt Romney and John McCain faced protracted challenges beyond Super Tuesday like Mr. Trump. The primary calendar and delegate allocation methods change from cycle to cycle, but at roughly the same stage of the campaign, both were performing far better.In 2012 Mr. Romney was in a three-way race with Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, with Ron Paul also nabbing votes. Yet by mid-March Mr. Romney had carried the popular vote in 21 states and won 57% of the allocated delegates, according to our calculation. Mr. Trump has 18 wins and 47% of allocated delegates. Mr. Romney swept the remaining primaries by convincing margins. Mr. Trump hasn't won 50% in any state.Mr. McCain in 2008 was even more of a consensus pick than Mr. Romney, whom he defeated that year. By this point the Senator had won 24 states and 59% of allocated delegates.Mr. Trump has fervent support but equally as passionate opposition, including among Republicans. Gallup reports his March 10-16 ""net favorable"" in the GOP is 22%, meaning the share of people with positive views minus those with negative views. Hard-fought campaigns tend to drive down everyone's approval for a time, but at this point Mr. Romney's net favorable was 28% and Mr. McCain's was 30%.The Real Clear Politics polling average shows twice as many adults have negative views (61%) than positive views (32.5%) of Mr. Trump. Gallup reports he ""has a higher unfavorable rating than any nominated candidate from either of the two major parties going back to the 1992 election when we began to track favorability using the current format.""Mr. Trump also tweeted Thursday that ""The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!,"" and we're glad he's such a loyal reader. We also aren't among those who think Mr. Trump is a sure loser in November, not least because Hillary Clinton's negatives are also historically high.But Mr. Trump has some major coalition repair work to do. The opinions he should care about are the 39% of GOP voters who said in Tuesday's exit polls that they would consider supporting a third-party candidate if Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are the nominees, or the 44% of non-Trump GOP voters who said they won't cast a ballot for him in November. As Mr. Trump likes to tweet, better be careful!",4/26/16
Trump's Accusers May See Him in Court Soon,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774104021?accountid=12768,"It is widely known that Donald Trump is being sued, including in class-actions -- by thousands of people who charge that he defrauded them of millions of dollars. But there seems to be public confusion about how these lawsuits might affect the presidential campaign. Despite what Mr. Trump says, it appears likely that he will be called to the witness stand before the November election.Trump University, a series of business courses that sold for up to $35,000, is the subject of three separate lawsuits, one in New York and two in California, all of which rely on the same general facts. One of these cases is likely to go to trial before the election, validating Sen. Ted Cruz's warning during the March 3 debate that ""if we nominate Donald, we're going to spend the spring, the fall, and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial.""Mr. Trump makes two arguments in rebuttal. First, he scoffs at the merits of the complaints, proclaiming that ""we will win in court."" Second, he suggests that nothing of importance will happen in the lawsuits until long after the election. During the same Detroit debate he admonished viewers to wait to ""see what happens,"" which he assured would be ""at the end of a couple years."" If Mr. Trump was implying that he would not be forced from the campaign to defend himself in court, the odds are that he is wrong.Two of the lawsuits are unlikely to be tried until after the election. The suit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is in the early stages of litigation and may not go to trial for years. The second case, Cohen v. Trump, a class-action pending in federal district court in San Diego, is closer to trial. That case involves claims that Mr. Trump's alleged frauds violated federal racketeering law. But court filings suggest it may not reach trial until late 2016 or even 2017.But the third lawsuit, Makaeff v. Trump University, also filed in federal court but with claims based upon state law, seems almost certain to go to trial this summer or fall, at the height of the 2016 campaign. The trial date won't be set before the final pretrial conference on May 6, but Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel already has signaled his intent. Last November he denied a request to consolidate Makaeff and Cohen for trial. A primary reason was that Makaeff was closer to being ready, and ""consolidating the cases presents a significant risk of further delays . . . with any trial not occurring until the early months of 2017."" In the same order, Judge Curiel declared that ""any factual findings made by the jury in any trial in Makaeff conducted in the spring or summer of 2016"" would be available for use later in Cohen.When the trial occurs, we can expect that Mr. Trump will testify. In a civil case like Makaeff, the plaintiffs can use a subpoena to force him to attend the trial as a witness. But one suspects that this will not be necessary. Lawyers for both the plaintiffs and Mr. Trump have already included him in their pretrial witness lists.If he testifies, Mr. Trump will be confronted with evidence that no candidate would like publicized during a campaign. Some of that evidence is common to all three of the pending lawsuits. For example, in promotional materials Mr. Trump promised prospective Trump University students that he would handpick their instructors and mentors. ""We're going to have professors and adjunct professors that are absolutely terrific. Terrific people. Terrific brains,"" Mr. Trump declared in one video. Then he added that ""these are all people that are handpicked by me.""Despite that promise, both Mr. Trump and the former president of Trump University, Michael Sexton, testified in depositions that Mr. Trump selected none of the instructors for ""live events"" or any of the students' faculty mentors. Plaintiffs might argue that deposition testimony establishes that Mr. Trump did not even know most of the instructors' names, faces or qualifications.Some of the claims Mr. Trump faces in Makaeff are specific to California law. For example, the plaintiffs claim that because some class members were over the age of 65 when they purchased Trump University products and services, Mr. Trump violated a California statute prohibiting ""financial elder abuse.""Mr. Trump undoubtedly will dispute these claims, perhaps by testifying that he knew nothing about the ages of Trump University customers. But this type of defense carries risks. It might bolster the plaintiffs' claims that he fraudulently promised to be directly involved with the students' educations when in fact he was not. Regardless of the ultimate success of these arguments, courtroom testimony by ""elder"" citizens that Mr. Trump defrauded them of their savings cannot be a happy prospect for a candidate.To avoid these political risks, Mr. Trump could try to settle the cases before they go to trial. But in recent public statements he has rejected that possibility, saying: ""This is a case I could have settled very easily, but I don't settle cases very easily when I'm right."" And: ""I don't get sued very often, because I don't settle, unlike a lot of other people.""Mr. Trump could also seek a postponement of the Makaeff trial until after the election, but such an attempt seems unlikely to succeed. He can hardly claim a lack of time to prepare. The class action was filed in 2010. Pretrial proceedings have been under way for years, and the probability of a trial this summer or fall has been apparent for months, if not longer.Even the enormous demands of a presidential campaign are unlikely to persuade federal judges to postpone the trial. Almost 20 years ago President Clinton sought to delay his testimony in the sexual-harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones until after his term was completed. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected that request, holding that the Constitution does not provide a sitting president with even temporary immunity from lawsuits over ""unofficial acts.""If a sitting president is not too busy to testify, one doubts that someone merely seeking that office is. Unless Mr. Trump settles the case, voters can expect to see him in court before the November election.---Messrs.

Election 2016: Debate Canceled As Trump Backs Out,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773764851?accountid=12768,"Plans to hold a 13th Republican presidential debate next week unraveled on Wednesday after two of the three candidates still in the race signaled they wouldn't participate, leading Fox News to announce the event's cancellation.GOP front-runner Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would skip Monday's scheduled debate in Utah in order to address a prominent pro-Israel advocacy group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.Later, an aide to Ohio Gov. John Kasich said the candidate would bow out of the debate if Mr. Trump didn't attend. Soon afterward, Fox News, which was to broadcast the event, said it had been canceled.A spokesman for Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign said that Mr. Trump was afraid to debate the senator, and that Mr. Cruz would use his Aipac speaking slot next week to push the businessman on his policies regarding Israel. ""Donald can't duck us for the rest of this campaign,"" the spokesman, Ron Nehring, said.Mr. Trump had previously expressed a lack of patience with the grueling primary debate schedule. He skipped a January debate in Iowa, and in an interview on CNN after the debate in Miami last week, Mr. Trump said that there had been enough Republican debates already.On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said he had committed to addressing Aipac awhile ago. The Republican National Committee announced on Feb. 20 that it had scheduled another debate for March 21.An Aipac official confirmed that Mr. Trump was to speak before the group on Monday, but said the timing of the speech by the businessman had yet to be determined.A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump's campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.""Donald Trump's decision to scuttle the Salt Lake City debate is disappointing, but not surprising,"" said Mr. Kasich's chief strategist, John Weaver.---Reid J.

Election 2016: Rust-Belt Senators Tread Carefully Around Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773764843?accountid=12768,"MILWAUKEE -- Six years ago, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin unseated three-term Sen. Russ Feingold in a GOP wave fueled by a backlash against government spending and President Barack Obama's signature health-care overhaul.This year he is in a rematch against Mr. Feingold. But instead of riding a wave, Mr. Johnson is navigating unpredictable currents stirred up by Donald Trump's drive for the Republican presidential nomination.The ability of Republicans to keep control of the Senate will depend on winning Rust Belt states such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois. And within those states, they will need strong turnout -- in particular the white, blue-collar voters who are plentiful in the industrial Midwest and have tended to vote Republican for years, but haven't always been motivated to get to the polls.This year, though, the Republicans' best shot for boosting that turnout is Mr. Trump, who has built his campaign around an anti-immigration and antitrade message designed to appeal to those who feel left out of the globalized economy.It is an agenda -- and a campaign tenor -- that the senators don't necessarily endorse.They also know that a Trump candidacy could energize young and minority voters for their Democratic opponents. All these factors are forcing them to tread carefully around their party's presidential front-runner.The four incumbents in these pivotal states, Mr. Johnson, as well as Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio, already have challenges of their own. Each comes from a state that voted twice for Mr. Obama.In each case, the state's other senator is a Democrat. And each represents a state whose manufacturing base has been decimated.The working-class voters who reside at the crossroads of these trends first aligned with Republicans in the 1980 Ronald Reagan revolution, but have been staying home in recent presidential races.In Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, whites without a college degree, a common definition of working-class, make up more than 50% of the electorate, census data show. But their turnout was low in the last two presidential elections.""They do feel left behind, particularly post-2008,"" said Steven Law, president of American Crossroads, a super PAC that helps Republican candidates and has been researching lower middle-income voters.Too proud to take government assistance, such voters are working multiple, part-time jobs, and didn't benefit from the stock-market rise fueled partly by low interest rates. They are less interested in blaming the rich than in trying to respond to upheavals triggered by expanded trade, the research found.This week, Mr. Trump demonstrated the breadth of his sway with working-class voters, winning those without a college degree in every primary state Tuesday, including Ohio and Illinois, exit polls showed. He came in second in Ohio, trailing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and won Illinois. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin Republicans go to the polls in April.With Mr. Trump now further on a path to win the Republican presidential nomination on the strength of his support among working-class whites, the senators' trick will be tapping into the energy he creates -- without totally disavowing their own records.Already the Republicans appear to be heeding the advice of party leaders to concentrate on local issues and run their races independently of the question of who will be at the top of the ticket. They have kept their distance from Mr. Trump, though Mr. Kirk, when asked by a local reporter, said recently he would support the New York businessman if he were the eventual nominee.Mr. Kirk has been drawing a contrast with his Democratic rival, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, who opposes a bill to pause the Syrian refugee program until government officials can certify that each refugee isn't a threat to the U.S. Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kirk favors the legislation.Mr. Johnson, who ran on an antideficit message in 2010, has since broadened his message. At a popular Milwaukee public-policy interview series last month, he stirred up a Republican crowd by saying that the science behind climate change was disputed, calling for quicker action to combat Islamic State, and highlighting his authorship of a bill to pause and overhaul a program to resettle Syrian and Iraqi refugees. He has also been localizing the race by talking about how the Supreme Court vacancy could be detrimental to gun-rights supporters -- who have benefited from a recent loosening of state gun laws -- unless the Senate remains in Republican hands.Mr. Toomey, whose Democratic opponent will be chosen in that state's primary April 26, is talking about his efforts to protect students by requiring background checks for school employees.In Ohio, Mr. Portman has been talking up a measure enacted last year to speed the federal permitting process for capital-intensive projects and thereby create jobs. He is also co-sponsoring legislation to combat drug overdoses.But history may not be on the side of the 11 first-term Republicans running for re-election. The last time so many first-term Republican incumbents were up, in 1986, Republicans lost control of the Senate -- one full Senate term after the Reagan revolution.Credit: By Siobhan Hughes",4/26/16
Election 2016: GOP Voters Divided on Immigration --- Primary electorate's varied views raise questions for Trump's hard-line stance,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773764760?accountid=12768,"Republican primary voters are deeply conflicted over whether to support immigration, despite GOP front-runner Donald Trump's hard line on the issue, raising questions whetherhis stance would help or hinder him in a general election.The New York businessman's immigration message has three parts: deport illegal immigrants in the country, build a wall along the Mexican border to keep them out, and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. With Republicans who support those positions, exit polls show, Mr. Trump is the clear winner.But the trouble for Mr. Trump is only about 10% of primary voters in the five states that held elections Tuesday identified immigration as the top issue in the campaign. Of that minority of voters in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri, he was the first choice by at least a 2-to-1 margin.Even in Florida, with its large population of Cubans and other Hispanic immigrants, only 12%of GOP voterssaid immigration was the top issue. Mr. Trump was the favorite of 60% of those voters, compared with 16% garnered by the second choice, Sen. Marco Rubio.On the issue of whether illegal immigrants working in the U.S. should be deported, a majority of the voters in all five states disagreed, choosing instead to offer illegal immigrants legal status. The margin favoring legal status ranged from 11 percentage points in Missouri to 18 points in Ohio.Again, of those who favored Mr. Trump's deportation policy, the businessman was the top choice by a solid margin over the number two.""Trump is talking to his chunk of voters,"" said Micah Roberts, a vice president at Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican pollster. ""He's got a very targeted message that's connecting to 30% to 40% of Republican primary voters.""It is unclear, though, if he can scale up that support in a general election. According to a February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters nationally say immigration helps the U.S. more than it hurts by a 53% to 38% margin.Republicans and Democrats sharply disagree on the issue, with GOP voters surveyed saying immigration hurts more than helps by a 63% to 30% margin, while Democrats say the opposite by a 70% to 22% split. Independents split 42%-42% on the question.Jeff Horwitt, a senior vice president at Hart Research Associates, a Democratic pollster that puts together the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll with Public Opinion Strategies, said Mr. Trump's stance is bound to alienate Latino voters. According to the poll, those voters say immigration helps the U.S. by a 71% to 20% split.""There are other issues [apart from immigration] that can resonate with Hispanics,"" Mr. Horwitt said. ""But if your nominee is out there saying, 'You'll build a wall and deport people who are here,' it's hard for [Hispanic voters] to hear anything else.""Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton hit hard on immigration in her Tuesday victory speech.""When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants and banning all Muslims from entering the United States. . .that doesn't make him strong, it makes him wrong.""Mr. Trump, speaking Wednesday on CNN, said he would be able to unify the country: ""There is a natural healing process once the battle is over, once the war is over.""Still, a part of Mr. Trump's immigration message matches well with GOP voters. By about 2 to 1, voters in the five states said they support banning Muslims temporarily from entering the U.S.Among those, Mr. Trump was first choice by between 9 and 41 points.Exit polls didn't quiz Democrats on immigration, or ask about Mr. Trump's wall plan on the Mexican border.In the Texas primary on March 1, won by Sen. Ted Cruz, GOP voters were quizzed on the wall and backed it by a 2-to-1 margin -- though Mr. Trump trailed Mr. Cruz as choice for president among those who wanted the wall. But those same voters said they backed legal status over deportation 47%-43%.Credit: By Bob Davis",4/26/16
Trump Keeps Up Pressure on Wary GOP,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773764758?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump moved Wednesday to claim the mantle of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and some once-wary members of the party are becoming resigned to that outcome.One day after Florida Sen. Marco Rubio dropped out of the race, Mr. Trump staked out a tough line on a possibly contested convention but said it was time for the party to heal.While some old-guard Republicans mounted resistance on Wednesday by lining up behind the remaining Trump rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, others were coming to grips with having the New York businessman at the top of the ticket.""It appears the efforts to stop Trump have failed miserably,"" said Scott Reed, political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""Republicans have a lot of thinking to do right now. The reality is that Trump had a really big night Tuesday,"" he said.Mr. Trump needs to win 57% of the remaining delegates to reach the 1,237 required for the nomination, a Wall Street Journal analysis found. That would be difficult, given Mr. Trump's margins of victory in states up to now, but not impossible.Mr. Cruz would have to take a daunting 83% of the delegates remaining. It is mathematically impossible for Mr. Kasich to win enough delegates to get to 1,237, so his only hope of gaining the nomination is to win it at the convention if Mr. Trump fails to amass a majority of delegates.Mr. Kasich, who fended off Mr. Trump on Tuesday in his home state, gained some support on Wednesday for his effort to force a fight over the nomination at the party's July convention in Cleveland.The Kasich campaign on Wednesday announced a team of campaign veterans and prior supporters of other GOP candidates to help him prepare for a possible convention fight.""The old-guard establishment will move his [Mr. Kasich's] way,"" said Tom Ingram, a prior supporter of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and one of the new Kasich advisers. ""I've gotten emails all day long from former Bush and Rubio supporters who want to know how to sign up.""But Mr. Trump warned that it would cause chaos in the party if he were denied the nomination -- even if he came to Cleveland shy of the 1,237 delegates needed.""I think you'd have riots,"" he said in a CNN interview. ""I'm representing . . . many, many millions of people. In many cases, first-time voters.""Florida Gov. Rick Scott, previously a fence-sitter, endorsed Mr. Trump and offered a similar warning Wednesday: ""With his victories yesterday, I believe it is now time for Republicans to accept and respect the will of the voters and coalesce behind Donald Trump. If we spend another four months tearing each other apart, we will damage our ability to win in November.""Members of Congress who backed Mr. Rubio were cautious on Tuesday after their favored candidate dropped out. Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) said he hasn't made a decision about whom to endorse now.""I'm not happy about Trump. I have concerns about him,"" he said, adding that he didn't know if a contested convention was the best move for Republicans.But South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, previously a Rubio supporter, endorsed Mr. Cruz on Wednesday.The three candidates are now heading into contests in 22 remaining states with 1,002 delegates left to allocate. The next electoral tests come March 22 in Arizona and Utah.In Arizona, which will award all 58 of its delegates to the winner, Mr. Trump enjoys important political advantages, because his anti-immigration message plays well there, and he has been endorsed by the state's premier critics of illegal immigration, former Gov. Jan Brewer and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.In Utah, Mr. Cruz hopes to win, because the state's Republicans meet in caucuses, contests where he has tended to do well, and because he has the backing of Utah Sen. Mike Lee.Former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who hasn't endorsed a candidate, said he thinks Utah could be friendly turf for Mr. Kasich, in part because he has had public support from Republican 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney.All three candidates will be battling in Wisconsin on April 5. Afterward, the calendar moves to Northeastern states, where the Kasich campaign is betting that local Republicans will give him a lift. Of course, that has also proven to be friendly territory for Mr. Trump, who took Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont.With the odds tilting in his favor, Mr. Trump's supporters say it is time for his rivals to see the writing on the wall. ""I don't think there will be a contested convention,"""" said Rep. Chris Collins of New York.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a former presidential candidate and fierce Trump critic who backed Mr. Bush until he dropped out of the race, too, said he believed Mr. Kasich would be the strongest candidate in the general election, but didn't see how he could win the GOP nomination.""I think John Kasich would be the most electable Republican, but it's clear Ted Cruz is outperforming everybody else, and that he is clearly the most viable alternative to Donald Trump,"" Mr. Graham said.Trump critics also face a tension between their desire to go with a nominee they consider more electable and the prospect of alienating Mr. Trump's many supporterswith a messy convention fight.""The purpose of a convention is to pick someone who can win, and the polls show Kasich has a much higher probability of beating Hillary Clinton,"" said Fred Malek, a GOP fundraiser who is neutral. ""But the risk is, there is severe blowback from people who voted for Donald Trump. There's a significant risk there's going to be some people who think the big guys have stolen the nomination.""In the meantime, Mr. Trump seems to be trying to pivot to general-election attacks on the Democrats' presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton. He also faces a series of tests of whether he can evolve from the provocative figure who holdsenormous rallies to one who can communicate in more measured ways.Mr. Trump began a more conventional bridge-building effort earlier this week by calling GOP leaders in Congress. And he has started trying to speak more pointedly about his desire to bring the party together.""I think there's a natural healing process,"" he said in the CNN interview. ""Once the battle is over, once the war is over, I think there really is a natural healing process.""---Siobhan Hughes, Rebecca Ballhaus and Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook and Reid J.

How Trump Can Raise His Game,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773724075?accountid=12768,"The Ides of March was kind to Donald Trump. He swept five of six contests and passed an important milestone, capturing 40% of the votes cast. Still, he's not a lock for the nomination.Mr. Trump holds 673 of the 1,463 delegates selected so far, meaning he must win nearly 56% of the 1,009 delegates left to secure a majority. That may not happen, especially since only 217 of those remaining delegates are in winner-take-all states. The primary may end in the chaos and drama of an open convention.Mr. Trump claims that he must be nominated since he will go to Cleveland with the most delegates. Yet Lincoln entered the 1860 Republican convention trailing William Seward. Yes, the party could blow up if the celebrity hotelier isn't nominated. Then again, it could be sundered if he is.The Donald is in a commanding position. But watch out: This is when some candidates slack off and make mistakes. Here are ten bits of unsolicited advice for the GOP front-runner:1. Change your tone. Nothing justifies the disruptions at your rallies by protesters from MoveOn and Black Lives Matter. But before you again urge your fans to ""knock the crap out of them,"" ask yourself if any president you admire would say that.2. Work to unify the GOP. Realize that while you've received 7.5 million votes, 37% of those cast so far, your competitors have won 12.8 million. You haven't carried 50% in any state, a mark that every previous nominee has hit much earlier. The party is deeply split, and you cannot simply claim it is time to unite. Having supported John Kerry in 2004, applauded Nancy Pelosi's speakership, and given money to Hillary Clinton in 2008, you must now earn your skeptics' confidence.3. Pay attention to party regulars. This fight has two theaters: Delegates' support is apportioned through primaries, but most of the delegates themselves are selected in party conventions.If the national convention is contested, 57% of delegates will become free agents after the first ballot, and 81% after the second. To win a convention battle, you'll need their support.4. Figure out how to parry the attacks. Your bankruptcies, fraud lawsuit, failed ventures and misogynistic statements are fair game -- and you need better responses. Effectively answering these attacks now will make you stronger when Democrats come after you.5. Stop being a one-man band. Surround yourself with experts who reassure voters that you can build the strong team needed to govern. Voters are drawn to you as an outsider, so find other business leaders to play active roles in your campaign.6. Take a breather, and make good use of it. The pace is slowing: There have been more than 30 contests in the past six weeks; there will be 13 in the next six weeks. Use the break to study the issues. Your knowledge of policy is a millimeter deep. Stop depending on cable TV shows for information. Instead, have actual experts brief you.7. Go after swing voters. They are different from primary voters, and they aren't buying your act. To them, your answers suggest that you don't know what you're talking about. When in a recent Fox News debate Chris Wallace showed that the numbers from your spending cut don't add up, your response was embarrassing.You may scoff, having gotten this far on banalities. But if you don't fix this, you could lose big. Your negatives are sky-high with voters up for grabs this fall. Understand why they are concerned and do something to change their attitudes.8. Keep the focus on Hillary Clinton and President Obama. Criticize what they have done by explaining what you would do -- specifically and concretely. Catchphrases won't cut it.9. Write a new stump speech. Your canned lines have gone stale. Introduce new material, maybe examples of what needs to be changed that play to your strengths as a businessman. Self-deprecating humor is good. You did it Tuesday to fine effect, joking about how negative ads aimed at you popped up on the TV screen last weekend while you were entertaining clients at your golf club.10. Please stop talking about polls. You sound like a pundit, not a president. And oh-by-the-way, most all the polls show you trailing Hillary.You've gotten much further than anyone, maybe even you, anticipated. But you're not the nominee yet. If you don't raise your game, you could suffer the fate of William Seward.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",4/26/16
Trump's Unification Tour,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1773722034?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is the likely GOP presidential nominee, but he still hasn't won over enough reluctant Republicans he'll need to get 1,237 delegates and win in November. His unity tour is off to an odd start.Mr. Trump started it Wednesday on ""Fox and Friends"" by declaring that he's done with debates. ""We've had 11 or 12 debates -- I did really well in the last one, I think I've done really well in all the debates,"" he said. ""But I think we've had enough. How many times can the same people ask you the same question?"" Fox News then canceled the debate scheduled for Monday. So the man who so easily conquered his opponents now thinks he's above engaging them.Next he traveled to CNN, where he said he is entitled to the nomination even if he doesn't reach a delegate majority. ""I think we'll win before getting to the convention, but if we didn't and we're 20 votes short, or we're, you know, a hundred short, and we're at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400, cause we're way ahead of everybody, I don't think you can say we don't get it automatically. I think you'd have riots."" He added that ""if you disenfranchise those people . . . I think you would have problems like you've never seen before."" Riots?A GOP convention can't steal something Mr. Trump doesn't own. Since 1860 the rules have required a candidate to have a delegate majority to win on the first ballot -- not a mere plurality. If a candidate fails, the rules allow delegates to support someone else. If Mr. Trump can't win a majority of Republicans, he can't win a majority of Americans in November. By the way, Hillary Clinton's primary vote total so far is 8,646,551, according to the Real Clear Politics count. Mr. Trump's is 7,533,692.Mr. Trump also visited MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" where Mika Brzezinski asked about foreign affairs and ""who are you consulting with consistently so that you're ready on day one?""""I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things,"" Mr. Trump replied, invoking a book he published in 2000 that riffed on Osama bin Laden. ""So I know what I'm doing, and I listen to a lot of people, I talk to a lot of people, and at the appropriate time I'll tell you who the people are. But I speak to a lot of people, but my primary consultant is myself, and I have, you know, I have a good instinct for this stuff.""Richard Nixon forgot more about foreign policy than Mr. Trump has ever known, and he still brought in Henry Kissinger. George H.W. Bush, a former Vice President and CIA director, had James Baker and Dick Cheney. All Presidents need trusted lieutenants who have thought about the world. On stage with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump will have to do more than point to his real-estate deals as a qualification for negotiating with China's Xi Jinping.Maybe Mr. Trump figures he can keep blustering his way to the White House. But the anti-Trump coalition could grow if voters see a front-runner who won't debate, threatens riots if he doesn't win, and whose foreign-policy brain trust consists of one brain.",4/26/16
Trump Leaves Trail Of Outsized Lawsuits,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772650359?accountid=12768,"When Donald Trump thought planes were flying too close to one of his luxury South Floridar esorts, he sued Palm Beach County for $100 million in an effort to change the flight path.When a series of concerts at the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City didn't come off as he wanted, the real-estate magnate filed a lawsuit alleging, among other things, that the band Earth, Wind & Fire wasn't A-list talent. He sued a Miss USA contestant for disparaging the beauty pageant on social media and elsewhere. He sued one of his own law firms for using his name in its marketing.Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, has faced hundreds of lawsuits during his long business career. A Wall Street Journal analysis of federal and state court filings shows that he and his companies also have filed a multitude of lawsuits against others when things haven't gone their way -- or to help them get what they want.The lawsuit over the Palm Beach airport is continuing. The suits over the concerts and against the law firm were dismissed; it isn't clear whether they were settled beforehand. Mr. Trump won his case against the beauty-pageant contestant.Litigation isn't unusual for resolving business disputes or enforcing contracts, particularly in the real-estate industry. It is difficult to determine whether Mr. Trump files more lawsuits than others with similarly broad business interests.The Republican Party has long argued that excessive litigation in the U.S. increases the costs of goods and services and limits job creation. Republican leaders have pushed, in particular, for medical-malpractice changes, to reduce fraud in the asbestos-claims process and to cut down on what they see as frivolous litigation in general.Mr. Trump's political opponents have cited his pattern of litigiousness to buttress their contention that he isn't a true conservative.""Trump clearly has an affinity for filing lawsuits, partly because he owns a lot of businesses,"" said James Copland, director of legal policy atthe Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank that is seeking to overhaul the legal system. Most troubling, he said, is ""where he is using litigation as a bullying tactic"" against individuals.""For the massive size of Mr. Trump's many companies, he is not litigious at all,"" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. ""When he is sued, however, he rarely settles the suit."" He doesn't like to settle, she said, ""because if he did, he would be sued much more often. This is the kind of mentality our country needs -- fight back and win.""The Wall Street Journal conducted a review of hundreds of court cases involving Mr. Trump and his businesses in federal and state courts since the 1980s.In the bulk of the cases, Mr. Trump or his companies were defendants. But in more than 50 lawsuits, ranging from contract disagreements to fights over his brand, Mr. Trump or one of his companies was the plaintiff. Some of Mr. Trump's lawsuits involve disputes over real-estate deals and financial transactions. Others center on Mr. Trump's public image or wealth.Mr. Trump's reputation for using the court system to advance his business interests has followed him on the campaign trail. Jeb Bush attacked him during a debate in February for using a lawsuit in the 1990s to ""try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City"" for a limousine parking lot -- an effort that ultimately failed. Mr. Trump said in the debate that although ""it's not that I love it,"" eminent domain is ""a necessity for our country.""Mr. Trump subsequently threatened to sue Texas Sen. Ted Cruz over the veracity of a TV campaign ad.""You have been threatening frivolous lawsuits for your entire adult life."" Mr. Cruz said in a news conference.""Even in the annals of frivolous lawsuits, this takes the cake.""The Republican Party has long favored overhauling the U.S. legal system to cut down on what it views as frivolous lawsuits. Nearly four of five Republican voters want Congress to approve a law to ""reform"" the legal system, according to a 2014 poll commissioned by the Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform.In the 1990s, Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit against Jay Pritzker, whose family was a part-owner of the Hyatt hotel chain, over the management of the Grand Hyatt in New York, one of Mr. Trump's signature early projects. The suit alleged mismanagement of the hotel and sought $500 million. The two men reached a confidential settlement in 1995.Often the stakes are smaller.Mr. Trump currently is pursuing a lawsuit in Florida centering on hotel workers who said they weren't paid for working a 10-day event related to Passover at the Trump Plaza Doral Hotel in Miami in April 2014. The total wages sought by 57 servers, cooks and managers: $139,067.25According to the lawsuit, the workers were hired by a staffing company, which didn't pay them. Toget paid, the workers sued Mr. Trump's hotel, a catering company and the tour company that organizes the annual Passover event at his hotel.When some of the defendants settled their case with the workers, Mr. Trump's hotel sued the co-defendants to make sure that the hotel wasn't stuck with the bill. Mr. Trump's hotel also is seeking to recoup its legal fees. The lawsuit is ongoing.Some of Mr. Trump's lawsuits relate to his image or brand. A 2011 lawsuit from one of Mr. Trump's companies alleged, among other things, that a business partner breached a licensing agreement involving the marketing of ""Trump Vodka"" in Israel. That case was dismissed the same year.Mr. Trump also has filed cases against individuals and media organizations over claims he considered wrong or derogatory.In 1984, he sued the Chicago Tribune for $500 million after its architectural critic wrote that one of Mr. Trump's planned hotels wouldn't be taller than the Sears Tower. Mr. Trump said the statement made it hard for him to find investors. Lawyers for the newspaper and its critic said the statements were matters of opinion that were protected under the First Amendment. A judge agreed and dismissed the case. The building was never built.Mr. Trump recently sued a labor union for what he said was an ""attempt to damage the reputation"" of the Trump Hotel Las Vegas by asserting that Mr. Trump himself refused to stay there during a campaign event last year.In a lawsuit filed last October, Mr. Trump said members of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 distributed a flier at a campaign event that said Mr. Trump stayed at the rival Treasure Island Hotel.In the lawsuit, Mr. Trump states the flier ""communicated to the public that the quality of the accommodations of Trump Hotel Las Vegas was not 'good enough' for Mr. Trump.""Lawyers for the labor union countered that the flier didn't disparage the quality of Mr. Trump's hotel, but stated that workers at Treasure Island are unionized, while Mr. Trump's hotel workers aren't. The case is pending.Mr. Trump's remarks on the campaign trail have contributed to more litigation. His disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants led the Spanish-language TV company Univision Communications Inc. to cancel the broadcast of a Trump-owned beauty pageant. Mr. Trump sued Univision for $500 million. The case settled in February. Terms weren't disclosed.Credit: By Brody Mullins and Jim Oberman",4/26/16
"Information Age: Donald Trump, Celebrity Politician",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772649462?accountid=12768,"Americans are divided between those wondering how Donald Trump could possibly be a leading presidential candidate and those wondering how others can wonder why. Both camps would benefit from Daniel Boorstin's ""The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America,"" which in 1961 explained the Trump candidacy.Writing the year after the first televised presidential debate, between JFK and Nixon, Boorstin predicted that new media technologies would transform politics -- and not for the better. He coined ""pseudo-event"" to describe photo-ops, presidential debates and other staged events whose relationship to the ""underlying reality of the situation is ambiguous."" Today he might have included provocative social-media posts.""Pseudo-events thus lead to emphasis on pseudo-qualifications,"" he wrote. ""If we test presidential candidates by talents on TV quiz performances, we will, of course, choose presidential candidates for precisely these qualifications."" Most earlier presidents would have failed, ""but our most notorious demagogues would have shone.""Boorstin defined celebrities as ""human pseudo-events,"" people known for ""well-knownness."" Another observation applies especially well to Mr. Trump: ""A sign of a celebrity is often that his name is worth more than his services."" Mr. Trump's financial disclosure shows that much of his claimed net worth is from licensing his name for buildings, resorts and menswear, not from businesses he runs.""Our national politics has become a competition for images or between images, rather than between ideals,"" Boorstin warned. Mr. Trump burnished his brand by appearing for a decade on ""The Apprentice,"" a reality-TV show. The show is a manufactured competition leading to the dramatic moment when Mr. Trump declares, ""You're fired!"" -- perhaps the ultimate example of how pseudo-events can build celebrity.Mr. Trump's campaign has obliterated whatever line remained between politics and entertainment. Polls suggest his supporters aren't troubled by vague, inconsistent or even authoritarian policy positions. He probably did himself no harm with supporters when MSNBC recently asked if he has foreign-policy advisers and he replied: ""Yes, there is a team. Well, there's not a team. I'm going to be forming a team.""But Mr. Trump's know-nothingness is anything but unknowing. ""I play to people's fantasies,"" he wrote in ""The Art of the Deal,"" his 1987 best seller. ""People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole.""This means voters can't be sure whether his pledges to build a border wall, ban Muslim immigration and launch trade wars -- and his rationalizing of Vladimir Putin and Tiananmen Square -- reflect his real opinions or instead are so much hyperbole intended to support a tough-guy image. His vulgar comments either reflect his character or define a character he has chosen to play.The media Mr. Trump claims to abhor enable his celebrity. The head of CBS, Les Moonves, told a recent investor conference that the Trump-dominated campaign ""may not be good for America,"" but ""it is damn good for CBS. . . . The money's rolling in and this is fun. . . . Bring it on, Donald. Keep going.""Mr. Trump's defenders could object that he is not the only candidate famous for being famous. Hillary Clinton is most famous for being a Clinton, as Mr. Trump is for being a Trump. She was a mediocre senator and as secretary of state pursued Obama administration policies that undermined U.S. influence around the world. Mr. Trump's supporters could also ask which is worse: Mr. Trump's let-it-all-hang-out personality or Mrs. Clinton's setting up private email to evade disclosure laws.Celebrities aren't likely to make great presidents. As Boorstin warned: ""The hero was distinguished by his achievement; the celebrity by his image or trademark. The hero created himself; the celebrity is created by the media. The hero was a big man; the celebrity is a big name.""It wouldn't surprise Boorstin that Mr. Trump's opponents haven't been able to stop him. ""Strictly speaking, there is no way to unmask an image,"" Boorstin wrote. ""An image, like any other pseudo-event, becomes all the more interesting with our every effort to debunk it.""Boorstin -- a conservative who served as librarian of Congress from 1975 through 1987 and died in 2004 -- encouraged Americans to protect the country's core values despite the new allure of image: ""Of all the nations in the world, the U.S. was built in nobody's image. It was the land of the unexpected, of unbounded hope, of ideals.""Voters looking for a candidate to confront Washington might consider whether a manufactured image is resilient enough to sustain leadership. A candidate with deep principles and considered policies could still trump Mr. Trump's image of a celebrity politician.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Plato and the Modern Celebrity Politician"" -- WSJ March 28, 2016)Credit: By L.

"Election 2016: Poll: Kasich Leads in Ohio --- Governor's home state votes on Tuesday with Florida, where Rubio is seen far behind Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772649426?accountid=12768,"TAMPA, Fla. -- The fortunes of Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Marco Rubio appear to be heading in opposite directions on the cusp of must-win primaries for both, a new poll finds.Mr. Kasich narrowly leads the Republican field in his home state of Ohio ahead of a winner-take-all primary on Tuesday, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll shows. The governor is the preferred pick of 39% of likely primary voters, followed by businessman Donald Trump at 33% and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 19%.The prospects aren't quite so rosy for Mr. Rubio in Florida, the state he has represented in the Senate for five years. He trails Mr. Trump by 21 percentage points.Mr. Trump has 43% support in Florida, well ahead of Mr. Rubio, who draws 22%. Mr. Cruz, with 21%, is essentially tied with Mr. Rubio.The poll results represent something of a mixed blessing for Mr. Trump's Republican detractors, who are trying to slow his march to the nomination. With a win in Ohio, Mr. Kasich can complicate the front-runner's ability to collect the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the nomination.But Mr. Trump is well positioned to claim the day's biggest prize, Florida's 99 delegates. Like Ohio, Florida will award all its delegates to the winner of the statewide vote.In Illinois, Mr. Trump leads the field as the top choice of 34% of likely Republican primary voters, followed by Mr. Cruz, at 25%, and Mr. Kasich at 21%. Mr. Rubio is in fourth place, with 16% support, but remains in the hunt for delegates under Illinois' delegate-selection process.The three states are among five that will hold primaries on Tuesday, allocating more delegates than any day on the nominating calendar except for March 1. Missouri and North Carolina also vote on Tuesday.The new Journal/NBC/Marist poll suggests that Tuesday is shaping up to be a good day for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, following her surprising loss to Sen. Bernie Sanders in last week's Michigan primary. The former secretary of state leads the Vermont senator by 61% to 34% among likely Democratic primary voters in Florida, the poll finds. Her lead is 20 points in Ohio, 58% to 38%.The race is closer in Illinois, the state where Mrs. Clinton was born. She leads Mr. Sanders by 6 percentage points, 51% to 45%.In addition to his traditional edge with younger voters and the party's most liberal voters, Mr. Sanders leads Mrs. Clinton among Latinos in Illinois by more than a 2-1 margin. That is more exception than rule in the primaries so far, as Mrs. Clinton typically dominates among nonwhite Democrats.""We should know whether Hillary Clinton has regained her momentum,"" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said of the contestson Tuesday. ""We should also have a better sense of whether Donald Trump is on the path to his party's nomination, or whether the GOP is staring at a contested convention in this unprecedented election cycle.""The poll, which was conducted March 4-10 in all three states, includes some warning signs for Mrs. Clinton in a general election. In test match-ups against some of the remaining Republicans, she trails Mr. Kasich by more than 20 percentage points among registered voters in Ohio, one of the largest battleground states. Mrs. Clinton also narrowly trails Mr. Cruz in Ohio. In Florida, she beats Mr. Cruz and runs even with Mr. Rubio.The picture is different when Mrs. Clinton is matched against Mr. Trump: In the hypothetical races, she beats the Republican front-runner in all three states. Her margins, however, are in the single digits in Florida and Ohio.Mr. Sanders beats Messrs. Trump and Cruz in all three states, the poll found.A loss in his home state would presumably end Mr. Rubio's candidacy.If the Republican race became a three-man contest afterTuesday, fault lines familiar from the voting so far would remain the same, the new poll suggests.Mr. Cruz typically beats Mr. Trump among the most conservative voters, while Mr. Kasich depends on more centrist Republicans, college graduates and women to build his support in the states where he has been able to get a serious look.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",4/26/16
Election 2016: Trump Effect on Numbers Debated --- Evidence is uneven that businessman is bringing new voters to the Republican Party,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772649422?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump delivered the message at both the opening and close of last week's Republican debate: The primary race had brought new voters to the GOP ""by the millions,"" enough to ""win us the election, and win it easily."" These voters, he said, ""want to see America be great again.""Mr. Trump called for the party to rally behind him. ""Be smart, and unify,"" he said, arguing he could draw new supporters, in a rebuttal to those who say he is driving voters away with his polarizing style.But evidence that Mr. Trump is bringing new voters to the Republican Party is uneven. While turnout has jumped substantially in Republican primaries and caucuses this year, the Democratic Party has gained more members than the GOP recently in some states that will be important in November.Of six battleground states surveyed after Mr. Trump's comments, two reported a bigger increase in Democratic than Republican voter rolls in recent weeks, while two reported a bigger increase for the GOP. In the two remaining states, membership gains were essentially equal.In the aggregate, Republican turnout in the primaries and caucuses through March 5 was up 40% from 2012, an analysis by Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies found, while Democratic turnout was down from the party's last competitive primary, in 2008.Some 3.2 million more people voted in GOP nominating contests than in Democratic contests this year through March 5, and 1.2 million more independents voted in Republican contests this year than in 2012, the analysis suggests.In another sign of enthusiasm for the GOP, some states are reporting that large numbers of Democrats are moving to the party. In Pennsylvania, more than 49,800 Democrats switched affiliation to the Republican Party this year through March 7, state records show, while about 25,400 Republicans switched their alignment to the Democrats.While that may suggest a GOP boon, the fuller picture is more complicated. In Iowa, the Republicans appeared to benefit from the most party-switching. And yet Democrats, not Republicans, picked up the most new members this year by a small margin, as independents changed affiliation and new voters entered the pool.A survey of several swing states showed a mixed picture of membership gains for each party. In Pennsylvania, the GOP has picked up 27,000 more new members in aggregate than the Democratic Party since early November. That includes people changing parties and those newly registered to vote. In North Carolina, the GOP's net advantage between December and mid-February stood at 11,000. Both are big states with lots of Electoral College votes.At the same time, the Democratic Party in Colorado has gained 22,000 more members since December than have Republicans, state figures show. Democrats also saw the bigger gains in New Hampshire.Voter-registration numbers give only a partial view of recent trends, as states vary in how they report data.Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, noted that the share of GOP primary voters without college degrees was 4 percentage points higher in last week's Michigan primary than in the GOP contest four years ago. Republicans without college degrees have tended to back Mr. Trump.But it isn't clear whether these voters were new Republican Party members, he said. And even if he is drawing new voters, Mr. Trump appears to be alienating others.""There's anecdotal evidence to suggest some former Democrats and independents are voting in Republican primaries and are enthusiastic about Trump,"" Mr. Rothenberg said. ""Other anecdotal evidence is that there are upscale, suburban, normally Republican, reliable voters who are horrified by Donald Trump's success and probably won't vote for him if he's the nominee.""Asked where Mr. Trump was seeing new GOP voters, Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, said by email: ""Look to states like Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, where it has been reported tens of thousands of Democrats have registered as Republicans to vote for Mr. Trump.""Massachusetts officials said they presumed that Mr. Trump and the lively GOP primary race were the reason that a large number of people were switching affiliation to the Republican Party. At the same time, there were calls in the state for independent voters to take a Republican ballot on primary day in order to vote against Mr. Trump.---Carol E.

"Election 2016: Vote Is Key for Kasich -- and GOP Race --- If governor doesn't beat Trump in Ohio, nomination battle may wind down",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772081134?accountid=12768,"Ohio is emerging as a key state for Republicans in next week's big-state presidential primary contests, representing a make-or-break moment for home-state Gov. John Kasich and a key indicator of whether the GOP nomination battle will be extended or start winding down.The two-term governor has bet his candidacy on winning at home and in states that come later in the primary contest, creating a new path to the White House.The outcome of his quest may determine whether front-runner Donald Trump has a new and potentially serious challenger, especially now that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio appears to be fading and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will soon be forced to compete outside his Southern comfort zone.With such stakes, Mr. Kasich has more than a dozen Ohio campaign stops in the next four days. He is blanketing the state's airwaves with TV ads and announced Thursday an endorsement from the most popular man in the state: Ohio State University football coach Urban Meyer.""Come to Ohio and we'll see!"" Mr. Kasich told a crowd in suburban Chicago this week. ""I'm beginning to surge.""If Mr. Kasich can ride his Ohio-or-bust strategy to the Republican nomination by stringing together victories in big Midwest and Western states, he will have created a new primary map that isn't anchored in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.A Fox News poll released Wednesday had the governor leading in the state with 34%, compared with the New York businessman's 29%.Mr. Trump's campaign will begin a $1 million Ohio TV advertising buy on Saturday, and it bought an additional $340,000 in the Cincinnati, Dayton and Toledo markets on Thursday, according to a person tracking media buys in the state. Mr. Trump is planning campaign stops Saturday in Dayton and Cleveland.Mr. Kasich's strategy of cherry-picking states later in the primary calendar has been tried before to little success, particularly when Rudy Giuliani in 2008 banked his campaign on winning Florida. He finished third and dropped out the next day.Mr. Kasich took lessons from Mr. Giuliani's experience and adapted. The former congressman skipped Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses, focusing his attention on New Hampshire, and then has competed only in states where his centrist politics were a good fit.He placed second in New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts, basically tied for second with Mr. Cruz in Michigan, came in third in Virginia and barely competed anywhere else.He left his rivals to fight over Deep South states, and then waited for them to come to his friendlier turf. Ohio would be his first victory.""Whenever we get to the Midwest, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, we're rocking and rolling at that point,"" Mr. Kasich said in a January interview on his campaign bus.Of course, Mr. Kasich might not be able to compete in all of those states. His campaign might not have submitted enough signatures to appear on the Pennsylvania ballot -- the issue is in the hands of a state judge, who is weighing a challenge from a Rubio supporter.Winning Ohio is vital for Mr. Kasich not only because it is his home state, but because his allies in the state GOP last fall engineered a change of state party rules to make it a winner-take-all state. All 66 of its delegates will go to whoever places first.If it is Mr. Kasich, he would more than double his delegate count, from the 54 he has won in the 24 nominating contests to date, leaving the governor in a distant fourth place behind Mr. Trump, with 458 delegates, Mr. Cruz, with 359, and Mr. Rubio, who has 151.Mr. Kasich has little hope of amassing enough delegates to win the 1,237 required to clinch the GOP nomination. Instead he is pinning his hopes on stopping his rivals from amassing delegates and forcing a contested convention in Cleveland, where he would have something of a home-court advantage.---Ben Kesling contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

Election 2016: Trump Donates Land for Tax Breaks --- Conservation easements allow the GOP front-runner to claim deductions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772045010?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump might be scoring millions of dollars in federal tax breaks by promising to limit development on some of his properties.The self-described ""ardent philanthropist"" donated development rights for some of his most valuable properties to conservation groups and local governments, protecting songbirds and big brown bats, and giving himself the ability to claim federal tax deductions, according to land records.Last year, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination pledged not to build on 74% of his Westchester County, N.Y., estate, and in 2014, he promised not to construct houses on a driving range in California, according to the records. He previously donated so-called conservation easements on his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., and his Bedminster, N.J., golf course. The land restrictions are legally binding and permanent.Mr. Trump's campaign in a news release described him last year as a ""major contributor"" to charities, citing donations of ""valuable parcels of land throughout the country."" The campaign said he had donated $102 million over five years, far exceeding reported gifts to his foundation.The campaign hasn't provided a detailed list of donations and didn't respond to requests for comment.Because Mr. Trump has so far declined to release his tax returns, citing continuing audits, it is impossible to tell what he deducted, how he valued the donations and whether the Internal Revenue Service challenged him. The 2015 easement would appear on tax returns for that year. Federal law prohibits the IRS from discussing individual taxpayers' returns.Each easement includes specific prohibitions on what Mr. Trump can do with the property, and each gives him certain rights, such as the ability to run a golf course or a private club. At his Westchester estate, for example, Mr. Trump can install solar panels or wind turbines, build picnic shelters and fire pits and ""construct a reasonable number of wildlife hunting or observation stands"" under the supervision of a land trust. But he can't erect any significant building, introduce non-native plants or excavate.To get a tax break, Mr. Trump would need an appraisal before and after the easement. He could then deduct the difference from his federal income taxes.The tax break is a valuable tool for protecting open spaces and habitats that has bipartisan supportin Congress.In 2012, 1,114 taxpayers donated a total of $972 million in conservation easements, according to the most recent IRS data.The break can besusceptible to abuse by wealthy landowners through inflated appraisals and tenuous definitions of conservation. The IRS routinely fights taxpayers over the tax break in audits and court cases, and the government often looks skeptically at easements ongolf courses. The developers of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in New Orleans and the National Golf Club of Kansas City have both landed in court with the IRS over their easements.The Westchester donation is the latest twist in Mr. Trump's 20-year ownership of theSeven Springs estate, once owned by the late Eugene Meyer, a former Federal Reserve chairman. It follows other attempts by Mr. Trump to develop the 213-acre property, which rests on a hilltop above Byram Lake.Years before he claimed the conservation donation, Mr. Trump proposed a golf course for the site, enraging neighbors, particularly those in Mount Kisco, which gets its drinking water from Byram Lake. Mr. Trump dropped the golf project, but his next plan -- high-end housing -- landed him in a second spat with residents and alawsuit.He made his Westchester donation on Dec. 11. On his federal disclosure form, Mr. Trump said Seven Springs is worth more than $50 million.The 158 acres Mr. Trump pledged to protect contain the homes of brown bats, potential habitats for mountain dusky and spring salamanders, and ""mature mixed hardwood forests"" that ""are valuable in terms of removing CO2 from the atmosphere,"" according to the document Mr. Trump signed in December. In September, he said he didn't believe in climate change.""It is a great piece of work to conserve this land,"" said Stephen Johnson, president of the North American Land Trust, the Chadds Ford, Penn., group that accepted the donation.Mr. Trump has donated easements at three other properties, which his financial disclosure says are each worth more than $50 million. Before the launch of his campaign in June, Mr. Trump and the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancyannouncedan 11.5-acre easement that prevented the construction of 16 houses on the driving range of the Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles. He signed the donation in December 2014.In 2004, Mr. Trump signed an easement detailing how he would protect the natural habitat of the bobolink, a grassland bird, at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.At Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Trump hosted his Super Tuesday victory party, he pledged in 1995 to maintain the historic site and protect its critical features. In 2002, Mr. Trump further clarified the easement to prevent more single-family homes being built on the property. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, which holds the easements, said the terms have been followed and the historic attributes of the property are well-maintained.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Richard Rubin",4/26/16
Misreading the Trump-Evangelicals Link,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772037120?accountid=12768,"Of all the bizarre aspects of the 2016 presidential campaign, none has been more puzzling to many observers than the embrace of Donald Trump by evangelical Christians. After losing the evangelical vote (and first-in-the-nation caucuses) to Ted Cruz in Iowa, Mr. Trump won a plurality of evangelical votes in a string of primaries. He did so again in Michigan and Mississippi this week, and a Fox News poll shows him with a 17-point lead among evangelicals ahead of the March 15 Florida primary. Mr. Trump would not be the Republican front-runner today without his ability to compete for evangelical votes.The vision of Jerry Falwell Jr. and Sarah Palin endorsing the twice-divorced Manhattan real-estate developer while evangelicals pack arenas to cheer his unique brand of politics-as-performance-art has caused some jaws to drop. For the chattering class, the odd alliance is like a plot twist from ""Elmer Gantry,"" offering an irresistible opportunity to bash the Republican front-runner and the party's evangelical base.New York Times columnist Frank Bruni recently faulted evangelicals for supporting a man who ""personifies greed"" and ""radiates lust,"" proving ""how selective and incoherent the religiosity of many in the [Republican] party's God squad is.""This consternation is shared by more than a few evangelicals. Former George W. Bush White House aide Pete Wehner has bemoaned his coreligionists' joining Mr. Trump in an angry politics of grievance that seeks ""scapegoats to explain their growing impotence."" Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore offered a simpler, half-in-jest explanation in a Washington Post op-ed: Many evangelicals ""may well be drunk right now.""But something larger and more interesting than resentment (or spirituous liquor) explains Mr. Trump's performance among evangelicals.First, a reality check: Mr. Trump is currently winning about one-third of evangelicals -- about the same share of self-identified evangelicals who supported the primary campaigns of Sen. John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. An impressive performance for Mr. Trump in a crowded field, to be sure, but hardly a majority. If the race narrows to Messrs. Trump and Cruz, expect a fierce, neck-and-neck battle for voters of faith.Mr. Trump benefits from an issue mix custom-made for an outsider businessman promising toughness on the international stage. After the Great Recession of 2008 and the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino late last year, Americans desire a strong leader who will revive the economy and protect the homeland. This is true for evangelicals too.Despite what liberal pundits imagine, they don't vote solely based on abortion and gay rights. A February Quinnipiac University survey found that the top issues for evangelical voters in the Republican primary were the economy (26%), terrorism (21%) and immigration (9%). Only 6% listed abortion.Second, evangelicals don't cast ballots based only on a candidate's religiosity (or lack thereof). They backed Ronald Reagan, a former Hollywood actor and the first divorced man to occupy the White House, over Southern Baptist Jimmy Carter. Reagan, while he was a deeply spiritual man, rarely attended church and eschewed the label ""born again."" But evangelicals admired him because he was pro-life and cast the Cold War in starkly moral terms. Those stands trumped Mr. Carter's piety.Similarly, Mr. Romney, a devout Mormon, drew 78% of evangelicals' votes in the 2012 election, despite their profound disagreement on theology.Some view this political eclecticism as spiritual dissonance. The media lacerated Mr. Trump for mangling a quote from ""2 Corinthians"" and referring to Holy Communion as ""the little cracker."" But evangelicals are less judgmental than the common stereotype suggests. They also take seriously the Constitution's prohibition on a religious test to serve in government, in part because it could someday be used to exclude them. This is a sign of civic health, not hypocrisy.The deepest crack running through the GOP electorate shaping Mr. Trump's constituency may be class, not religion. Journalist Ron Brownstein, writing in the Atlantic magazine in February, showed that Mr. Trump's strongest support comes from white voters without a four-year college degree, especially blue-collar evangelicals. Mr. Trump speaks to their economic anxiety when pledging to bring jobs back to the U.S. and stop illegal immigration.Yet Mr. Trump's message is not about bread alone. He has condemned the Supreme Court's Obergefell decision last year on same-sex marriage, saying the matter should be left to the states. Mr. Trump professes to be pro-life. In a recent interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, he vowed to repeal the prohibition on political speech by pastors and churches that has threatened their tax-exempt status and led to IRS harassment.Rather than condemn Mr. Trump's evangelical supporters as bigots or the Bible-toting booboisie, we would do better to understand what animates them. Are they disillusioned by Republicans promising to appoint judicial conservatives to the Supreme Court, only to see a Republican-appointed majority on the court uphold Roe v. Wade and redefine marriage? Are they tired of a party that seeks their votes but often treats their concerns as a liability? Perhaps. Evangelicals are not immune to the sense of betrayal by party elites that prevails at the grass roots.Mr. Trump may not worship at the same church or share the theology of most evangelicals. But he is a voice and vehicle for the disenchantment they feel toward Washington, and their yearning for a strong leader to transform it. Republicans would be wise to figure out how to harness this force in a positive -- and winning -- direction before it runs them over.---Mr. Reed is founder and chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: The Evangelicals Are Voting For a President, Not a Pastor"" -- WSJ March 22, 2016)Credit: By Ralph Reed",4/26/16
The Polls Trump Hasn't Won,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771795027?accountid=12768,"The rules of political proportionality can be kind, as they were Tuesday to Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Vermonter's margin of victory over Hillary Clinton in Michigan was slight, 49.8% to 48.3%. But because his vote was spread over more congressional districts, he walked away with 65 delegates to her 58. Still, Mrs. Clinton expanded her lead by winning Mississippi 82.6% to Mr. Sanders's 16.5%, netting 29 delegates to his four. She now holds 760 elected delegates to his 546.On the Republican side, Donald Trump took a plurality of the delegates available Tuesday, winning 71. Sen. Ted Cruz came away with 56, Gov. John Kasich 17, and Sen. Marco Rubio zero. Mr. Trump now has 458 delegates. His opponents' delegates, plus those who are uncommitted to a candidate, total 598.In the lead with 34.9% of the votes cast so far, The Donald is increasingly talking about the general election, claiming he's ""won many polls, as you know, against Hillary Clinton."" That's not true. In the Real Clear Politics average of national head-to-head matchups, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump by 6.3 percentage points, winning 47.3% to his 41%. In the 49 national polls since the beginning of last May, he led her in five, was tied in two, and lost 42.Mr. Trump is the only remaining GOP candidate who has never led Mrs. Clinton in the Real Clear average. By comparison, Mr. Kasich is ahead by 7.4 points, 47.7% to 40.3%; Sen. Marco Rubio is up by four points, 48% to 44%; and Sen. Ted Cruz leads by 0.8 points, 46.2% to 45.4%.Polls suggest the celebrity hotelier would have difficulty in critical battleground states. In the Real Clear average, Mr. Trump trails Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire by 7.5 points and North Carolina by one point. Worse, the latest polls suggest his position may be deteriorating. He loses North Carolina by six points in a Feb. 17 survey by Elon University; Virginia by 17 points in a Jan. 26 Roanoke College survey; and Iowa by 8 points in a Jan. 7 poll by NBC/The Wall Street Journal/Marist.The Republican front-runner does have some bright spots. In Florida he's tied with Mrs. Clinton in the Real Clear average. In Ohio, he leads Mrs. Clinton by two points in a Feb. 20 Quinnipiac survey, and in Colorado by 11 points in a Nov. 18 Quinnipiac poll.Could The Donald offset losses in traditional battleground states by winning blue-collar states that Democrats carried in recent elections? There is reason to doubt it.Despite his primary victory Tuesday in Michigan, Mr. Trump trails Mrs. Clinton in the Real Clear head-to-head average there by 7.8 points. Similarly, in Wisconsin he's behind by 10 points in a Feb. 21 Marquette University poll.He might have a shot at Minnesota, where he trails in Real Clear's head-to-head average by only 2.3 points. He could win Pennsylvania, where he led by two points in an Oct. 11 poll by PPP (a Democratic firm) but trailed by two in an Oct. 5 Quinnipiac survey. However, even if Mr. Trump carried these two states, their combined 30 electoral votes would not offset the loss of the 38 electoral votes of Virginia, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Iowa.Mr. Trump suggests those numbers will improve when he begins attacking Mrs. Clinton in the general election: ""I haven't even started on her yet."" Then again, neither have Democrats started on him.They will pummel him over his bankruptcies, this summer's Trump University fraud trial, his crude and misogynistic statements, his nativism while hiring foreign workers, his imperious manner. These things may not matter to Mr. Trump's die-hard Republican primary supporters; they will matter to swing voters in a general election.The GOP contest will arrive at its most critical moment next week. If Gov. Kasich wins Ohio, Sen. Rubio wins Florida and Sen. Cruz wins North Carolina, no one is likely to go to the convention with a delegate majority. On the other hand, if Mr. Trump wins Florida and Ohio, he'll arrive in Cleveland in a strong position to become the party's standard-bearer.At this stage, stopping Donald Trump from winning the nomination will require Republicans to vote strategically, casting ballots for the non-Trump candidate best positioned to win each state. That's easy to suggest; it's a lot harder to pull off.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the 1896 Election Still Matters"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",4/26/16
Trump Shifts His Position on Torture,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770472777?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said Friday he wouldn't order the U.S. military to break international laws -- an attempt to tamp down criticism by military and legal experts that his policies on torture and killing terrorists' family members would violate the Geneva Conventions.The clarification was one of two Mr. Trump made after Thursday night's raucous presidential debate. The second concerned his position on visas for highly skilled immigrants. He appeared in the debate to strike a new position favoring them, but after the debate said he still opposed a visa program that many businesses use to bring in those workers.The shifts come as the campaign has moved to a new phase, in which Mr. Trump is attempting to position himself better for a potential general-election campaign, while also coming under pressure to flesh out his sparse policy positions.In Thursday's debate, he came under such pressure from both of his main rivals, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who as part of their escalating attacks on the GOP front-runner demanded more policy specifics from him.Mr. Trump, in a statement to The Wall Street Journal about his views on harsh interrogation of terror suspects, said he would ""use every legal power that I have to stop these terrorist enemies. I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters.""He added, ""I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.""That appears to be a reversal from Thursday night's debate in Detroit, when Mr. Trump stood by his earlier promise to do things that were a ""hell of a lot worse"" than waterboarding to terrorist suspects, and also to authorize the military to kill family members of terrorists.When he was asked Thursday night about making military officers obey orders on harsh interrogation methods, which they might consider illegal, Mr. Trump said, ""I've always been a leader. I've never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they're going to do it. That's what leadership is all about.""Former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden said last week the military would flatly refuse to obey orders to commit torture or kill family members of terrorists. Under U.S. and international law, soldiers can be found guilty of war crimes if they obey an unlawful order.Michael Schmitt, director of the Stockton Center for the Study of International Law at the U.S. Naval War College, said in an interview that ordering the military to torture terror suspects would violate Article 17 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and that people who participate in torture -- as well as their superiors and even the U.S. government -- could face war-crimes charges for such behavior.Ordering the military to kill the family members of terrorists falls under the legal definition of ""collective punishment,"" which is prohibited under the laws of war. ""You may punish an individual for his or her violations of the laws of war, but you may not in any way harm others,"" Mr. Schmitt said.Mr. Trump's new position Friday came after months of insisting that he wouldn't back down on the issue of torture.The Geneva Conventions address the treatment of prisoners of war, civilians in occupied areas, and similar issues.The U.S. is also bound by the Convention Against Torture, signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988, which says, ""No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.""The convention also provides that an ""order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification of torture.""In 2002, then-President George W. Bush declared that al Qaeda and Taliban detainees weren't protected by the Geneva Conventions. At the time, secret Justice Department memos stipulated that U.S. personnel wouldn't be violating the law if they used extreme interrogation methods to protect national security.At Thursday's debate, when asked to name people he trusts on foreign policy, he cited Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and retired Gen. Jack Keane, chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, describing them as ""excellent.""Both men said Friday they wouldn't endorse Mr. Trump or any other candidate, preferring to stay impartial in the race and provide briefings to candidates who ask. Gen. Keane said he had never discussed policy with Mr. Trump, and Mr. Haass said he has briefed him just once.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's remarks on visas for skilled workers, known as H-1B visas, enmeshed him in controversy on his signature issue of tightening immigration into the U.S. He appeared to retract his long-held opposition to such visas after the debate moderators pressed him on inconsistencies during his campaign.""I'm changing. I'm changing,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We need highly skilled people in this country . . . One of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges . . . [and] as soon as they're finished, they'll get shoved out.""But an hour after the debate, the Trump campaign issued a statement clarifying his position. Mr. Trump wasn't speaking about the H-1B guest-worker program, which ""is neither high-skilled nor immigration,"" the statement read. ""I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program . . . No exceptions.""His support for allowing more foreign graduates of American universities to stay in the U.S. is a position closer the GOP's business wing and the technology industry, whose support he would want as he moves toward a general-election campaign. But it could put him at odds with anti-immigration groups that have been among his most ardent backers.Credit: By Damian Paletta and Nick Timiraos",4/26/16
Election 2016: Trump Run Splits New York GOP --- Candidate's home- state support is in the spotlight as state party holds convention,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770472568?accountid=12768,"BUFFALO, N.Y. -- As Donald Trump ascends on a path toward becoming the first GOP presidential nominee from New York in many decades, the Republican Party in his home state -- already weakened from years of Democratic reign -- is torn over his rise.Many Republican leaders in New York, especially those from the socially liberal and economically prosperous downstate region, are skittish about or outright opposed to his candidacy. But even some like Rep. Peter King, who endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, see at least the possibility of gains for the party in the state with a Trump general-election candidacy, saying he could ""cut into disaffected Democrats"" in the state.""It's really debatable,"" Mr. King said. ""He could make so many mistakes and offend so many people that we could be ruined for a generation. We've never had a candidate with the potential for such significant gains and for such catastrophic losses.""Last month, Mr. Trump predicted that in a general election against Democratic front-runner and former New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, he could win their home state, even though Democrats outnumber Republicans by 3 million registered voters and a Republican hasn't won any statewide office since 2002.Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski dismissed any findings that showed the businessman would be weak in New York, calling it ""hyperbole"" advanced by his critics. ""This guy is the premier GOP candidate,"" he said.Mr. Trump was a hot topic on Friday at the state party's convention here. Susan McNeil, the Republican chairwoman for the region surrounding Albany who attended the convention, said she endorsed Mr. Trump and expects other county chairs to do so soon.""We are fed-up upstate,"" Ms. McNeil said. ""The leaders aren't listening at the top. We are all frustrated.""Supporters have started a phone bank to recruit volunteers, and Ms. McNeil said she has had grocery clerks and other strangers in her home in Fulton County pledging their support after she made her presidential pick known.There is a desire by some to see a Republican nominee with strong New York ties, despite misgivings about the particular demeanor and politics of Mr. Trump.""There's the concern that you never know what's going to come out of his mouth,"" said Nicole Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman who is the New York chairwoman of Mr. Rubio's campaign, ""but Donald is a respected businessperson and he's a New Yorker, so people have mixed feelings about him.""Many Republican leaders expressed concern that Mr. Trump would further drive women and minorities from the party and into the arms of Democrats.Gerald Benjamin, a professor of politics at the State University of New York in New Paltz and a former Republican official in upstate Ulster County, said that Mr. Trump will end up boosting turnout in New York for Mrs. Clinton if they capture the nominations for their respective parties. That result, he said, could hurt Republicans running in the fall for re-election to the state Senate, where the GOP holds a razor-thin majority.""I'm hoping for a brokered convention,"" Mr. Benjamin said.But Mr. Lewandowski argued that Mr. Trump will encourage new voters to register as Republicans. He also dismissed the premise that Mr. Trump would hurt other Republican candidates in New York in the fall if he becomes the GOP's nominee.""This notion from the political elites that Donald Trump is going to hurt the down-ballot, show me the empirical data?"" he said.Another challenge for Mr. Trump is that New York party leaders know better than any other groups of Republicans his political history, which hasn't always been favorable to the local GOP. ""He's supported the Democratic Party as much or more than the Republicans,"" said Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb. ""He's never made a donation to the Assembly Republicans,"" he said.In addition, Mr. Kolb suggested, Republicans in New York may resent Mr. Trump for toying with their expectations when he flirted with a gubernatorial run against Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2014.""These people were very enthused about his campaign, and he got them all fired up and then left them standing at the altar,"" Mr. Kolb said.Added Mr. King: ""I don't remember him being involved after 9/11. I don't see him at Mets games, Yankees games. . . . There's nothing distinctively New York about him.""Credit: By Erica Orden and Heather Haddon",4/26/16
Election 2016: Suit Against Trump Program Can Advance,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769404735?accountid=12768,"A fraud allegation against Donald Trump's education program can move forward, a New York state appeals court said Tuesday in a ruling likely to fuel controversy over an issue Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican presidential primaries have seized on in recent weeks.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued the now-defunct Trump University in 2013 for $40 million, alleging it was a sham that exploited Mr. Trump's celebrity status to persuade people to enroll in expensive courses that failed to deliver on their promises.Trump University defrauded students by billing itself as a real-estate school and charging students as much as $35,000 without having official accreditation, Mr. Schneiderman alleged.In 2014, a judge dropped one of two fraud claims made by Mr. Schneiderman against Trump University, while also ruling that Mr. Trump hadn't complied with licensing requirements.On Tuesday, a four-judge panel in New York City reinstated the dropped fraud claim, allowing Mr. Schneiderman to move forward with both fraud claims. The panel ruled that the lower-court judge had misapplied New York law on fraud and on the statute of limitations governing the claims.""Today's decision is a clear victory in our effort to hold Donald Trump and Trump University accountable for defrauding thousands of students,"" Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We look forward to demonstrating in a court of law that Donald Trump and his sham for-profit college defrauded more than 5,000 consumers out of millions of dollars.""Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, said the company disagreed with the ruling and would appeal.""We believe that the decision is internally inconsistent,"" he added. ""The court, by its own admission, contradicts not just one, not just two, but three of its very own prior rulings.""Mr. Trump has denied the allegations and accused Mr. Schneiderman of ""gross incompetence"" and of ""wasting millions in taxpayer money"" on the investigation. Mr. Trump's attorney filed an ethics complaint against Mr. Schneiderman in 2013 with two state bodies, alleging that the attorney general leaned on the Trump family and a top adviser for donations while the prosecutor's office was investigating the education company.Mr. Schneiderman denied any wrongdoing. New York's ethics commission said it wasn't taking any action on Mr. Trump's complaints in August.Trump University launched in 2004, billing itself as a path for aspiring real-estate investors to learn about asset management, real estate and other business-related fields from faculty who were handpicked by Mr. Trump himself. According to the attorney general, Mr. Trump didn't have a role in choosing instructors and tried to take advantage of people who enrolled in the increasingly expensive programs.Students could take a free introductory course, and then sign up for three-day seminars at a cost of $1,495. They were then encouraged to buy advanced training programs for about $35,000.The institution dropped the ""university"" tag in 2010 and rebranded itself as the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative. It informed the New York State Department of Education that it had ceased operation in 2010, according to court documents.The former Trump University also faces a class-action civil suit filed against it in California.Credit: By Christopher M.

"Trump, Clinton Pile Up Victories --- GOP front-runner wins Super Tuesday contests, but Cruz takes two states, Rubio one, guaranteeing bruising race will continue",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769404665?accountid=12768,"New York businessman Donald Trump won Republican primaries Tuesday from the Deep South to New England, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took his home state and Oklahoma, ensuring that the race for the GOP nomination will stretch into the spring.The Republican front-runner won contests in at least seven states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia -- bolstering his claim on the nomination. Still, the pockets of resistance in others gave a glimmer of hope to detractors desperate for another candidate to take on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who also rolled to a series of victories on Super Tuesday.The problem for Mr. Trump's rivals -- as it has been since the voting began -- is that there are too many of them for voters to coalesce behind a single alternative to the New York billionaire. In the past week, opponents have dramatically intensified their attacks on Mr. Trump after he steamrolled rivals in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.Tuesday's results, however, reinforced Mr. Trump's argument that he is building a durable coalition of GOP primary voters fed up with politics as usual that may bolt the party if he isn't the nominee. ""We have expanded the Republican Party,"" Mr. Trump declared Tuesday night at a rally at his resort Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. ""I am a unifier.""He promised that he would work with some of the same GOP leaders in Congress, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have been skittish about his rise. ""I'm sure I'm going to get along with him, and if I don't, he's going to pay a big price,"" Mr. Trump said of the Wisconsin lawmaker.Mr. Trump's victories Tuesday are all the more impressive because, for the first time in the race, he faced concerted attacks from his chief Republican rivals. He continues to defy the laws of presidential politics, courting controversies that few other politicians could survive.Republicans who appreciate his candor continue to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt even when he lands in hot water, as he did over the weekend when he seemed reluctant to reject the support of a former Ku Klux Klan leader""I know Donald's going to make some mistakes when he gets to Washington, but who hasn't?"" said Ducky Wall, 77, a retired golf pro from Georgia who voted for Mr. Trump. ""I think he can shake things up.""But a handful of close contests Tuesday exposed some fissures in that support, as rivals, elected officials and some of the party's most prominent donors ganged up on the Republican who has spent much of the race insulting influential figures in the party. An anti-Trump group hosted a fundraising call Tuesday that drew some of the party's biggest donors, including hedge-fund titan Paul Singer, a supporter of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.Tuesday's results give Mr. Cruz new grounds to argue he is the leading alternative to Mr. Trump, beating the front-runner in Oklahoma and the Lone Star State, a month after his victory in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. The wins reinforced Mr. Cruz's argument that he is the only Republican who can topple Mr. Trump. But Mr. Rubio did win one state, topping Messrs. Cruz and Trump in the Minnesota caucuses.""After tonight we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump,"" Mr. Cruz said at his victory party.Mr. Cruz benefited from voters skeptical about Mr. Trump. ""I'll weep, if he is the nominee,"" said Cruz supporter Julie Earl, of McKinney, Texas, referring to Mr. Trump. Added Terry Sauls of McKinney, ""He's a Democrat in Republican boots.""Tuesday marked the first chance for the remaining GOP contenders to test their strength across different segments of the electorate. Roughly 60% of Republican voters in Virginia graduated from college and support legal status for immigrants in the country illegally. In Alabama, 54% of GOP primary voters said undocumented immigrants should be deported.The rules of the GOP nominating contests could muddy the results because most of Tuesday's states divide delegates proportionality. The rules differ in each, but candidates that clear certain thresholds will qualify for delegates. And no candidate had yet to clear the 50% threshold in statewide balloting to claim the bulk of any one state's delegates. The complex delegate math made it too tough to determine the exact total each candidate won Tuesday.The race now turns to a pair of swing states that are home to two of Mr. Trump's remaining rivals-Mr. Rubio in Florida and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Mr. Trump may be able to knock either from the race by beating them on their home turf.Questions arose late Tuesday about the viability of Messrs. Kasich and Rubio's campaigns. On Tuesday, Mr. Rubio's campaign manager told donors in Washington, D.C., that they were committed to going all the way to the Republican convention in Cleveland in July.For the first time in this race, Messrs. Cruz and Rubio over the past week took on the front-runner at the same time. The two senators, along with Mr. Kasich, are trying to outlast each other to set up a head-to-head match up with Mr. Trump. Time is dwindling for a candidate other than the former reality TV star to collect enough delegates to win.Mr. Trump's February winning streak triggered a backlash from his rivals and other elected GOP officials petrified by the prospect of the brash billionaire topping the ticket. His detractors are desperately trying to hatch strategies to deny him the nomination, including a bruising convention fight that could alienate his supporters.No Republican has been more vocal than Mr. Rubio. After spending much of the past year trying to avoid direct confrontations with his rivals for the nomination, Mr. Rubio has resorted to calling Mr. Trump a ""con artist,"" questioning his wealth and even suggesting the front-runner urinated on himself during the most recent candidates' debate last Thursday night.Mr. Trump has responded to the broadsides by referring to Mr. Rubio as ""Little Marco"" and dismissing his digs as a feeble attempt to claw his way back into the race. In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Mr. Trump called on Mr. Rubio to exit the race. ""I think he has to get out,"" he said.Mr. Trump found himself embroiled in a potentially more serious controversy over the weekend when he hesitated to disavow the support of David Duke, a former Grand Wizard in the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Trump eventually rejected Mr. Duke's support and blamed his initial response on a bad earpiece during his CNN interview.But the episode underscored Republicans' fear that Mr. Trump may imperil GOP candidates at every level of the ballot, if primary voters make him the nominee.On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton used the David Duke episode to tell a Minneapolis crowd she was ""very disappointed"" Mr. Trump didn't immediately disavow the former Klan leader's support. ""I'm just speaking out against bigotry and bullying wherever I hear it,"" she said. ""And I hear a lot of it from the Republican candidates.""Mr. Trump's Republican detractors have grown louder and more strident as the front-runner gets closer to clinching the nomination. A pair of retiring GOP congressmen -- Reps. Reid Ribble of Wisconsin and Scott Rigell of Virginia -- joined South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford and Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo in vowing not to vote for Mr. Trump, even if he becomes the nominee. They followed former Republican National Committee Chairmen Mel Martinez and Ken Mehlman, among other current and former elected and party officials.""Trump is a bully, unworthy of our nomination,"" Mr. Rigell wrote his constituents on Monday night. ""To live with a clear conscience, I will not support a nominee so lacking in judgment, temperament and character needed to be our commander-in-chief.""Credit: By Patrick O'Connor and Janet Hook",4/26/16

""They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on people's prejudices; we appeal to their highest ideals.""Mr. McConnell added his voice to the roiling intraparty crisis, saying, ""It's very important that the American people understand that the Republican Party condemns in the strongest possible language David Duke, the KKK and everything they stand for.""Mr. Trump had rejected Mr. Duke's support at a Friday news conference, but then declined to do so in a CNN interview Sunday. He later blamed a faulty television earpiece for his hesitation and in subsequent interviews disavowed the backing of Mr. Duke.The episode stirred in Republican lawmakers a public anxiety and frustration they had been hesitant to display. The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, said ""the vulgarity and just the lack of basic decency in the discourse is just really harmful.""Others warned that Mr. Trump could drag down vulnerable Republican incumbents -- possibly flipping control of the Senate to Democrats -- and still others openly discussed strategies for separating candidates down the ballot from the potential presidential nominee.In denouncing the comments, though, most Republicans stopped short of saying they wouldn't back Mr. Trump if he were the party's nominee. Neither of the leaders, for example, referred to Mr. Trump by name, reflecting the line establishment Republicans must walk: They can't appear to be dismissing the many voters Mr. Trump has rallied to the polls. The year is a critical one for Senate Republicans -- they are defending 24 seats to the Democrats' 10, and control of the body could flip if the Democrats pick up a net of four seats and win the presidency.Some lawmakers worked hard to parse their positions on the Trump phenomenon; others were less cautious.""Most of us are sort of tired of building our political career around what we should say about Donald Trump,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who dropped out of the presidential race in December. He suggested Republicans had made a mistake by failing to consolidate around an alternative, and that the outsider candidate was ""very close"" to reaching ""a critical mass.""While a handful of congressional Republicans have endorsed Mr. Trump, most notably Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, others said they wouldn't back the party nominee if it were Mr. Trump. At least four House Republicans, including Reps. Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Carlos Curbelo of Florida, said they couldn't tolerate backing Mr. Trump. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska is leading that charge in the Senate, saying in a television interview Tuesday, ""I don't think this guy has any more principles than a Kardashian marriage,"" a reference to the celebrity family.Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said the Republican establishment, by being quiet about Mr. Trump for so long, had only itself to blame. ""They're afraid the Trump millions will stand up against the people who are whispering in their offices and are afraid to say anything public,"" Mr. Reid said.Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, who is seeking to unseat Republican Sen. John McCain, on Monday released an advertisement pointing to comments from the veteran senator that he would support Trump if he became the nominee. Mr. McCain doubted his opponent could tie him to the New York businessman. ""Trump has attacked me,"" said the Vietnam prisoner of war who was last year portrayed by Mr. Trump as at fault because he was captured. ""Maybe she missed that.""Sen. John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota, tried to calm tensions by saying his colleagues must run their own races because ""you can't control"" what is ""happening above you."" He said he hoped the nominee is ""someone that can unify Republicans.""Pressed on whether Mr. Trump could be that nominee, Mr. Thune said, ""It remains to be seen.""---Reid J.

Politics & Ideas: The Trump Test for Principled Republicans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769330664?accountid=12768,"The seemingly inexorable rise of Donald Trump has created an existential crisis for many lifelong Republicans, not the least for principled conservatives. They are asking themselves whether they can go along as their party tacks toward protectionism, nativism and xenophobia; whether they are willing to be led by a man who proposed a religious test for immigration policy and threatens to round up and deport 11 million immigrants unlawfully present in the U.S.They wonder whether they can accept as president a man who threatens a free press with libel laws redolent of the 1798 Sedition Act (which nearly destroyed the American republic in its infancy), openly advocates war crimes as an instrument of state policy, approvingly tweets a quotation from Benito Mussolini, and embraces Kremlin thug Vladimir Putin as a kindred spirit.There is abundant evidence that Mr. Trump is, as Sen. Marco Rubio pungently puts it, a con man. But suppose we give Mr. Trump more credit than he deserves and take him at his word. It is abundantly clear that no Mexican leader or government would ever agree to pay for his border wall. What then? He would lack the legal authority to impose tariffs on countries such as China and Mexico that run persistent trade surpluses with the U.S. What then? He has proposed a massive tax cut and other programs that, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, would add between $11.7 trillion and $15.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. This plan, which would be ruinous if enacted, would not be adopted, and candidate Trump has no other economic agenda. What then?Tom Coburn, a conservative Republican who retired from the Senate last year, said in a statement Monday supporting Sen. Rubio's candidacy for the Republican nomination that Mr. Trump is ""perpetuating a fraud on the American people. His empty promises, bullying and bloviating rhetoric will only deepen the frustration and disillusionment that gave rise to his campaign. He simply lacks the character, skills and policy knowledge to turn his grandiose promises into reality.""If you think the American people are angry and mistrustful now, imagine how they will feel after three months of (God forbid) a Trump presidency.Then there is the way Mr. Trump has chosen to conduct his campaign, which has degraded democratic discourse and made the U.S. a global laughingstock. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that the New York billionaire is doing ""everything . . . we teach our kids not to do in kindergarten."" In recent days, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a rising young Republican star, blasted Mr. Trump's ""relentless focus . . . on dividing Americans, and on tearing down rather than building back up, this great nation.""And what can one say about Mr. Trump's repeated refusal on CNN over the weekend to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's praise, followed by the candidate's claim that he couldn't hear the host clearly through his earpiece? Longtime Republican strategist Stuart Stevens cut to the heart of the matter: ""To support Trump is to support a bigot. It's really that simple.""In a stinging rebuke, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman -- who was Chris Christie's campaign finance co-chairwoman until the New Jersey governor dropped out of the race -- said on Sunday that ""Donald Trump is unfit to be president. He is a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears. Trump would take America on a dangerous journey."" As for Mr. Christie's Trump endorsement last week, she said: ""For some of us, principle and country still matter.""Principled Republicans have choices in the general election other than supporting their party's nominee. They can sit out the contest. They can write in the candidate of their choice. Or they can organize an alternative. Asked whom he would support in a Trump/Clinton contest, Sen. Sasse replied, ""Neither of them,"" adding: ""If Donald Trump ends up as the GOP nominee, conservatives will need to find a third option.""A reasonably well-funded effort on behalf of an independent conservative candidacy could surmount ballot access and other technical issues. If such an effort doesn't come to pass, it will be because no one cared enough to try, not because it couldn't be done.No doubt some would object that an independent candidacy would hand the election to Hillary Clinton. It might well. Republicans who care about the integrity of their party, or about principled conservatism, will have to decide whether that is the worst-case outcome.Kevin Madden, a veteran Republican operative, told the Feb. 28 Washington Post that ""for many Republicans, Trump is more than a political choice. It is a litmus test for character.""Indeed it is, and Gov. Christie has already flunked it. In the next few weeks, it will be revealing to see how many leading Republicans emerge from this test with their honor intact.Credit: By William A. Galston",4/26/16
Trump Voters Need a Mirror,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1769330066?accountid=12768,"Trump supporters are disappointed in America's leadership elites.They have this feeling even if they lack clear thoughts. Yet this late moment is not too late for some political types to insist that Trump voters must be understood, even though Trump voters have been easy to understand all along. Indeed, a whiff of fear enters the air as Mr. Trump progresses toward the nomination. These disappointed-with-elites people are in charge! They are powerful. I'd better scramble over to their side.But the relevant point has always been ""yes but."" One reason to care about Mr. Trump's past, his statements, his vulnerabilities is because, on the way to office and once in office, politicians face opposition.The opposition will use his peccadilloes and indiscretions against him. Can he withstand the onslaught and rally a coalition? Can he enact a program? Is the program any good? Would he be a wounded, embattled and ultimately failed (and probably absentee) president from the moment he took office?To be honest and impolitic, the Trump voter smacks of a child who unleashes recriminations against mommy and daddy because the world is imperfect.The blaming of elites has gone too far. The American voter has a big hand in his own disappointments. His retirement system has been a conspicuous demographic Ponzi scheme for at least two generations, yet he keeps voting for unfunded benefits. The Obama administration complains in its latest economic report about declining state and local investment because all the money is going to the unfunded pension promises negotiated by public-sector employees (i.e., voters) without also negotiating the taxes to make good on them.Yet voters have welcomed being gulled with talk of lockboxes and trust funds while their payroll taxes are diverted to unrelated, voter-pleasing spending and the alleged trust funds are filled with IOUs by the government to itself.Voters stood idly by or cheered as politicians loaded up our economy with regulations and growth-killing institutions that undermine productivity.Yet Trump voters, like children, now say, But you promised!My colleague Bill McGurn on Tuesday described the failure of another populist conservative celebrity, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to conquer the establishment in California. That's right, because voters sided with the establishment to defeat impeccably reformist, Arnold-backed ballot measures to curb the power of public-sector unions and end legislative gerrymandering.In D.C., voters decisively sided with teachers over students in ousting Mayor Adrian Fenty and his reformist schools chancellor Michelle Rhee.Or read Robert Dewar's ""A Savage Factory"" about life in a Ford plant. Read the Journal's own reporting years ago about worker sabotage of GM's Saturn experiment or its California plant until Toyota took it over. Who is busy ruining the American university at the moment but the students privileged to study there, many of them heavily subsidized by taxpayers.America's fix is not unique by any means. Similar problems define the moment in Western Europe and Japan. The polarization and bitterness of our politics can be exaggerated, but there's a reason for the souring mood. Handing out goodies to voters is more pleasant than taking stuff away and makes for a lot more bipartisan conviviality.The deepening strife comes not because we are being victimized by immigrants, plutocrats, Chinese trade negotiators, institutional racists or other scapegoats proffered by the scapegoat peddlers.We've run out of the ability credibly to promise ourselves more goodies than a non-growing population in a non-growing economy can supply. The resources aren't available because we don't produce them -- either because we can't or won't work productively enough or because we decline to labor under high enough tax rates.It turns out government cannot spare us collectively from having to adapt and compete in an economy. It can't suspend the reality principle. Not the biggest lie of the electoral season but a characteristic one is Bernie Sanders's claim that huge sums will be discovered by taxing ""Wall Street speculation."" Guess what? Many of the transactions his ""speculation"" tax aims to tax won't take place if taxed. There will be no gusher of revenues with which to continue the expansion of government goodies.One party, the Democrats, wants to keep winning by offering free things -- free health care, free college. Their bet is they can extract satisfactory political rents from being the go-to party for groups seeking to protect their spending.The other party, the Republicans, is stuck being the reform party -- if it has the nerve, which is highly doubtful.Mr. Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again"" lacks an acting noun. Apparently the Chinese and Mexicans can bestow concessions that will make us great again -- or something. Until Mr. Trump and his fans show otherwise, he seems but the latest vessel of denial for voters who don't want responsibility, they want mommy and daddy.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: We Don't Need a Mirror, We Need a Leader"" -- WSJ Mar. 9, 2016)Credit: By Holman W.

"Trump Rivals Turn Up Heat --- As Super Tuesday vote looms, Rubio and Cruz intensify attacks on GOP front-runner",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768525567?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's rivals launched last-ditch efforts Sunday to derail the Republican presidential front-runner's campaign, intensifying the competition ahead of voting Tuesday in 11 states that could all but seal the race's outcome.Sen. Marco Rubio charged that Mr. Trump failed to denounce white supremacists, expanding his fevered pitch that the New York businessman is unfit to be the GOP standard-bearer.""We cannot be a party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Mr. Rubio told hundreds of cheering supporters at Patrick Henry College, a Christian school in Purcellville, Va. ""Not only is that wrong, it makes him unelectable. How are we going to grow our party?""Mr. Trump said earlier Sunday on CNN that ""I don't know anything about David Duke,"" a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard who flagged his support for Mr. Trump last week. Hours later, Mr. Trump tweeted, ""As I stated at the news conference on Friday regarding David Duke -- I disavow.""Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump's other main rival, chimed in on Twitter: ""You're better than this. We should all agree, racism is wrong, KKK is abhorrent.""Mr. Cruz also attacked Mr. Trump for declining to release income tax records, saying on NBC that the real-estate developer had something to hide, possibly a connection to organized crime.""There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported.""Mr. Trump has said he wouldn't release his tax records because he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Asked about Mr. Cruz's mafia comments, Mr. Trump, through a spokeswoman, said, ""Lying Ted Cruz is grasping at straws because he is so far down in the polls. He is a nervous wreck.""Mr. Rubio's attack, made in a state central to his bid to gain momentum in Super Tuesday voting, illustrated his new willingness to confront Mr. Trump. But it also highlighted the quandary Mr. Rubio faces.The Florida senator is emerging as the favorite of the party's elected leaders and top GOP activists, yet with the anti-Trump vote fractured, Mr. Rubio can't seem to pull off a victory or deprive Mr. Trump of one.Mr. Trump -- who won three of the last four contests -- appears headed for a near-sweep in the states awarding delegates Tuesday. He gained an important endorsement Sunday from Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a leader of the Tea Party movement and staunch foe of illegal immigration.To slow down the New York billionaire, one or two of the three remaining top candidates must abandon their quest. Yet none seem willing to do so because each sees an advantage in the primary calendar that is tantalizingly close.Mr. Cruz aims to win his home state of Texas on Tuesday, which could boost his delegate count; Mr. Rubio is fighting to take Florida on March 15, where the winner will pocket all the delegates.The trouble is, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has embraced the same strategy with his state's primary, also March 15, where the winner likewise will secure all the delegates.If no one backs down, Mr. Trump could slip past them all -- and may defeat a couple of them on their own turf. The outlook is putting major Republican donors, party leaders and elected officials in states ranging from panic to depression.""A lot of Republicans are feeling resigned to the notion that Trump will be the nominee and then go down in flames in the general"" election, said Al Hoffman, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee who supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before he quit the race. ""It will be all over on March 15 when Trump wins big time in Florida.""Mr. Rubio's top allies are taking a one-day-at-a-time approach, while suggesting that Messrs. Cruz and Kasich should stand down.""People who were supporting Cruz and Kasich are starting to switch their votes to Rubio because they see it's a two-person race and they want a Republican to win the White House,"" said Rep. Barbara Comstock, who represents the district that includes the college where Mr. Rubio spoke.Mr. Rubio, who has taken to mocking Mr. Trump's tweets, cast his decision to go negative as a last resort to prevent a ""con artist"" from taking over the Republican Party and conservative movement.The Cuban-American senator noted that the GOP field includes another Hispanic, Mr. Cruz, and an African-American, Ben Carson, implicitly drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and disparaged Mexican immigrants.""We are the party of diversity,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""We are going to grow this party and we are going to unify it.""Mr. Rubio's general-election-like argument came in the first of four appearances Sunday in a state that has swung back and forth between the two parties. Virginia voted for President Barack Obama twice and elected Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, but has backed Republican majorities in the state Legislature.A big part of Mr. Trump's success has been his domination of free media through both television interviews and Twitter postings. Mr. Trump also drew attention Sunday for re-tweeting a quote from the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini: ""It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.""Asked on NBC if he wanted to be associated with a fascist, Mr. Trump bragged about his unprecedented reach in the GOP field on social media.""I want to be associated with interesting quotes,"" said Mr. Trump, who has 6.4 million followers on Twitter. ""Hey, it got your attention, didn't it?""Voters backing Mr. Rubio are divided about his anti-Trump offensive. Lauren Stevens, a 17-year-old high school senior in Ashburn, Va., said she is excited to cast her first presidential vote for Mr. Rubio but that he shouldn't ""stoop to Trump's level."" Vicky Quick, 48-year-old owner of a graphic design firm, said, ""I think it's about time he stood up and said something. Trump has changed the game, and he's got to get in the ring and fight or Trump is going to trample him.""---Janet Hook contributed to this article.Credit: By Beth Reinhard",4/26/16
"Election 2016: Polls Point to Big Gains for Trump, Clinton",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768525548?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton hold leads in key states up for grabs in Super Tuesday's nominating contests, suggesting the front-runners are poised to pull decisively ahead of their rivals.Mr. Trump is ahead of his nearest rival by 18 percentage points in Tennessee among likely Republican voters, and by seven points in Georgia, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll taken between Feb. 18 and 25.Mrs. Clinton has commanding leads in Tennessee and Georgia, as well as in Texas, where she has 59% of the vote, compared with 38% for rival Bernie Sanders.Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is emerging as Mr. Trump's strongest competitor on Tuesday, leading in the poll with support of 39% of likely voters in Texas -- the state with the most delegates at stake on Tuesday -- compared with 26% for Mr. Trump. The Texas senator is hoping that a strong win in his home state will bolster his argument that he is the only Republican with the support necessary to take on Mr. Trump.The polls of three Super Tuesday states point to contests that are entering a critical new phase, in which Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have the potential to cement early gains. Given those stakes, both are drawing a battery of attacks from rivals determined to stop them from winning all of the 11 states awarding delegates on Tuesday.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has picked up the support of much of the Republican establishment since former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush left the race, is neck and neck with Mr. Cruz in both Georgia and Tennessee. Mr. Rubio had the support of the 23% of the vote in Georgia, matching Mr. Cruz, the poll found. The Florida senator had the support of 19% of likely voters in Tennessee, compared with 22% for Mr. Cruz.But the polls, which have a margin of error of between 3.8 and 5 percentage points, found that Mr. Trump was easily ahead of both men, with the support of 30% of voters in Georgia and 40% in Tennessee.Two other GOP candidates -- retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- each have support in the single digits in the three states.In the Democratic contest, Mrs. Clinton is dominating the field, based in large part on commanding margins among African-American voters. She leads Mr. Sanders by 34 points in Georgia, where black voters make up a majority of the likely Democratic voting pool, and by 26 points in Tennessee, where African-Americans make up almost a third of the Democratic electorate.The strengths Mr. Sanders has carried in prior nominating contests are apparent in the new poll. He wins among independent voters who say they'll participate in Democratic primaries in the three states, and carries voters under age 45 in Tennessee and Texas. Those groups helped propel him to a big win in New Hampshire and what essentially was a tie in Iowa.The Texas poll also shows that Mr. Sanders has made some inroads in the Latino community, with support among 47% of likely Latino voters compared with 52% for Mrs. Clinton.The polls were conducted before Mr. Trump was endorsed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and before Thursday's GOP debate, in which Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz challenged Mr. Trump's business ethics, conservative credentials, and policy positions.Credit: By Byron Tau and Siobhan Hughes",4/26/16
An Airwaves Strategy to Beat Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768525118?accountid=12768,"David McIntosh has been fighting for economic freedom for 30 years, and he is convinced the battle has reached a hinge moment. ""The stakes really are that high,"" says the president of the Club for Growth. ""If we don't do this, it's all at risk. This is the moment.""By ""this"" he means denying Donald Trump the Republican presidential nomination. The club is one of America's most effective free-enterprise advocacy groups, and for months it has tried to alert voters, often without much other support, to the risks of a Trump nomination.With the primary race now at a decisive moment, Mr. McIntosh is trying to rally support for a sustained anti-Trump push leading up to the winner-take-all primaries on March 15. With Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz finally confronting the front-runner, Mr. McIntosh is convinced that the billionaire can still be defeated with the help of a sustained TV and social-media assault.""We've got people on our side still saying, 'Let's wait and see.' Or 'maybe we can fix this in a brokered convention,' "" says Mr. McIntosh. ""My message is that's too late. It's got to be now.""When Mr. McIntosh took over the Club for Growth presidency more than a year ago, the former Indiana congressman had no idea his first real fight would be trying to stop a TV celebrity from hijacking the Republican Party. The club usually plays in House and Senate campaigns, and it is backing no presidential candidate. ""We're neutral on the other candidates. We've said that both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are gold standards -- either would be great on economic issues. This is about stopping Trump.""The Club for Growth has warned about Mr. Trump for months, even as others slumbered. The group produces white papers on every presidential candidate, parsing records and policies on taxes, trade, spending and entitlement reform. The summaries on most candidates this year are either complimentary or mixed. The one on Mr. Trump began, ""Donald Trump is not a pro-growth conservative.""Mr. McIntosh's concern escalated as the billionaire rose in the primaries even as polling showed that Mr. Trump would lose in November. ""He loses the general. But his presence on the ticket also loses us the Senate,"" he says. With the recent death of Justice Antonin Scalia, he adds, ""that means we lose the Supreme Court too. And that's the most devastating. You can win back the Senate in two; you can compete for the White House in four; but the court, you lose every issue for a generation.""The Club for Growth believes voters must be educated about Mr. Trump's long history of progressive economic views. But those views must also be seen as a function of Mr. Trump's commercial interests -- that is, that he has a political character problem.The group produced two such ads in Iowa that it says hurt the candidate who had otherwise brushed off criticism. One focused on Mr. Trump's support for the Supreme Court's Kelo decision that let government seize private property for developers. The ad said: ""Trump can make millions. We lose our property rights.""A second Iowa ad recounted Mr. Trump's past calls for higher taxes, government-run health care and the Wall Street bailout, and argued that he is conning voters. It ends: ""Trump. Just another politician.""The club spent $1 million on those ads from Sept. 15 through Oct. 5. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Mr. Trump peaked in Iowa around Sept. 21, with 28% of the vote, then began a slide to 22% by Oct. 6 -- where he stayed for nearly a month after the ads came down. He finished second with 24%.Mr. McIntosh's group skipped New Hampshire, where Mr. Trump dominated and no one took him on. The club did put up ads in South Carolina. Mr. Trump won, though Mr. McIntosh believes that the ads helped cut a 20-point lead to 10. ""The message of all those ads was: 'He's playing us for chumps.' And it resonated,"" he says.The plan now is to apply this strategy across the key remaining primary states. The club has already raised enough money to run anti-Trump ads in two states that vote Tuesday: Oklahoma and Arkansas. The goal is to soften up Mr. Trump enough to let his competitors win a state or two. ""This part is about showing that he can be beat,"" says Mr. McIntosh. The Super Tuesday states allocate their delegates on a proportional basis, so a stronger Rubio or Cruz showing would limit Mr. Trump's delegate lead.The main targets are the first winner-take-all primaries on March 15 -- Florida, Ohio, Missouri and Illinois. The club is producing new ads that will focus on the victims of Mr. Trump's business practices -- his bankruptcies, Trump University, eminent domain. ""They'll show that when Trump is in charge, real average people get hurt -- that he's dangerous, that he's not who he says he is,"" Mr. McIntosh says.The club president knows that Mr. Trump's core supporters won't be moved. The ads are aimed instead at the 10% to 15% of the GOP electorate who are intrigued by the billionaire's brashness but peel away when they learn more about his past. If the club can diminish Mr. Trump, then other candidates might be able to win those states, and Mr. Trump will have a harder time getting a delegate majority.Mr. McIntosh is also pleased that Messrs. Cruz and Rubio have picked up the club's strategy. Mr. Rubio is hitting Mr. Trump's business past and Mr. Cruz is hammering the point that Mr. Trump ""takes advantage of the little guy."" This is a theme, Mr. McIntosh says, ""that can work.""Mr. McIntosh must raise enough money to mount a sustained campaign, and he admits some donors have been reluctant to join the fight. Some still hold the fantasy that Mr. Trump will implode, while others want their favorite candidate to attack the other non-Trumps and be the last one standing.Others worry about becoming a Trump target. The billionaire recently tweeted about a donor who had given money to a separate anti-Trump effort: ""I hear the Rickets [sic] family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!"" Cubs owner Tom Ricketts said his family will continue to ""stand up for what we believe in,"" but others have been intimidated.Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the Club for Growth for its ads and has demanded Mr. McIntosh's resignation. Mr. McIntosh called the club's board chairman, Steve Stephens, to warn him: ""I said, 'Trump's calling for me to be fired.' And he was great. His response was: 'Just go get him.' And that's what we've all got to do.""---Ms. Strassel writes the Journal's Potomac Watch column on Fridays.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",4/26/16
Declarations: Trump and the Rise of the Unprotected,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768288054?accountid=12768,"We're in a funny moment. Those who do politics for a living, some of them quite brilliant, are struggling to comprehend the central fact of the Republican primary race, while regular people have already absorbed what has happened and is happening. Journalists and politicos have been sharing schemes for how Marco parlays a victory out of winning nowhere, or Ted roars back, or Kasich has to finish second in Ohio. But in my experience any nonpolitical person on the street, when asked who will win, not only knows but gets a look as if you're teasing him. Trump, they say.I had such a conversation again Tuesday with a friend who repairs shoes in a shop on Lexington Avenue. Jimmy asked me, conversationally, what was going to happen. I deflected and asked who he thinks is going to win. ""Troomp!"" He's a very nice man, an elderly, old-school Italian-American, but I saw impatience flick across his face: Aren't you supposed to know these things?In America now only normal people are capable of seeing the obvious.But actually that's been true for a while, and is how we got in the position we're in.Last October I wrote of the five stages of Trump, based on the Kubler-Ross stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Most of the professionals I know are stuck somewhere between four and five.But I keep thinking of how Donald Trump got to be the very likely Republican nominee. There are many answers and reasons, but my thoughts keep revolving around the idea of protection. It is a theme that has been something of a preoccupation in this space over the years, but I think I am seeing it now grow into an overall political dynamic throughout the West.There are the protected and the unprotected. The protected make public policy. The unprotected live in it. The unprotected are starting to push back, powerfully.The protected are the accomplished, the secure, the successful -- those who have power or access to it. They are protected from much of the roughness of the world. More to the point, they are protected from the world they have created. Again, they make public policy and have for some time.I want to call them the elite to load the rhetorical dice, but let's stick with the protected.They are figures in government, politics and media. They live in nice neighborhoods, safe ones. Their families function, their kids go to good schools, they've got some money. All of these things tend to isolate them, or provide buffers. Some of them -- in Washington it is important officials in the executive branch or on the Hill; in Brussels, significant figures in the European Union -- literally have their own security details.Because they are protected they feel they can do pretty much anything, impose any reality. They're insulated from many of the effects of their own decisions.One issue obviously roiling the U.S. and Western Europe is immigration. It is the issue of the moment, a real and concrete one but also a symbolic one: It stands for all the distance between governments and their citizens.It is of course the issue that made Donald Trump.Britain will probably leave the European Union over it. In truth immigration is one front in that battle, but it is the most salient because of the European refugee crisis and the failure of the protected class to address it realistically and in a way that offers safety to the unprotected.If you are an unprotected American -- one with limited resources and negligible access to power -- you have absorbed some lessons from the past 20 years' experience of illegal immigration. You know the Democrats won't protect you and the Republicans won't help you. Both parties refused to control the border. The Republicans were afraid of being called illiberal, racist, of losing a demographic for a generation. The Democrats wanted to keep the issue alive to use it as a wedge against the Republicans and to establish themselves as owners of the Hispanic vote.Many Americans suffered from illegal immigration -- its impact on labor markets, financial costs, crime, the sense that the rule of law was collapsing. But the protected did fine -- more workers at lower wages. No effect of illegal immigration was likely to hurt them personally.It was good for the protected. But the unprotected watched and saw. They realized the protected were not looking out for them, and they inferred that they were not looking out for the country, either.The unprotected came to think they owed the establishment -- another word for the protected -- nothing, no particular loyalty, no old allegiance.Mr. Trump came from that.Similarly in Europe, citizens on the ground in member nations came to see the EU apparatus as a racket -- an elite that operated in splendid isolation, looking after its own while looking down on the people.In Germany the incident that tipped public opinion against Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal refugee policy happened on New Year's Eve in the public square of Cologne. Packs of men said to be recent migrants groped and molested groups of young women. It was called a clash of cultures, and it was that, but it was also wholly predictable if any policy maker had cared to think about it. And it was not the protected who were the victims -- not a daughter of EU officials or members of the Bundestag. It was middle- and working-class girls -- the unprotected, who didn't even immediately protest what had happened to them. They must have understood that in the general scheme of things they're nobodies.What marks this political moment, in Europe and the U.S., is the rise of the unprotected. It is the rise of people who don't have all that much against those who've been given many blessings and seem to believe they have them not because they're fortunate but because they're better.You see the dynamic in many spheres. In Hollywood, as we still call it, where they make our rough culture, they are careful to protect their own children from its ill effects. In places with failing schools, they choose not to help them through the school liberation movement -- charter schools, choice, etc. -- because they fear to go up against the most reactionary professional group in America, the teachers unions. They let the public schools flounder. But their children go to the best private schools.This is a terrible feature of our age -- that we are governed by protected people who don't seem to care that much about their unprotected fellow citizens.And a country really can't continue this way.In wise governments the top is attentive to the realities of the lives of normal people, and careful about their anxieties. That's more or less how America used to be. There didn't seem to be so much distance between the top and the bottom.Now it seems the attitude of the top half is: You're on your own. Get with the program, little racist.Social philosophers are always saying the underclass must re-moralize. Maybe it is the overclass that must re-moralize.I don't know if the protected see how serious this moment is, or their role in it.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: The 'Unprotected' Flock to Donald Trump"" -- WSJ Mar. 5, 2016)Credit: By Peggy Noonan",4/26/16
"Christie Embraces Trump --- As former Republican rival joins billionaire's team, front-runner and challenger Rubio trade insults",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768288051?accountid=12768,"The hard-fought 2016 Republican presidential campaign hit a new level of intensity on Friday, capped by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie endorsing Donald Trump amid an exchange of biting personal insults between Mr. Trump and rival Sen. Marco Rubio.Mr. Trump's strong momentum ahead of Super Tuesday on March 1, when 11 states will award 595 delegates, prompted Mr. Rubio to suggest that half of the Republican Party would abandon the New York developer if he wins the nomination.But Mr. Trump signaled that he is trying to fuse his anti-establishment coalition with the political mainstream by appearing with Mr. Christie, a former Republican rival and the Republican Governors Association's president.For Mr. Trump, Mr. Christie's endorsement represents the first significant figure with ties to the political establishment to join his campaign. It also shifted attention from Thursday's debate, when Mr. Trump found his business record the subject of sustained attacks from both Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Mr. Rubio.Mr. Christie ended his own presidential campaign after his sixth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary. Since returning to New Jersey, Mr. Christie had been considering an endorsement privately, people familiar with the governor's thinking said.He had intended to wait to officially endorse until after Super Tuesday or the mid-March primaries, but changed his mind after Mr. Trump asked him to breakfast Thursday morning in New York City to talk over the matter, the people said.Mr. Trump asked for an earlier endorsement to help him shore up additional establishment support before Super Tuesday, including Southern governors with whom Mr. Christie had formed relationships, one of the people said.The endorsement came after a day in which Mr. Rubio continued his newly aggressive tack against Mr. Trump. Asked in Oklahoma City if he would support Mr. Trump if he is the nominee, Mr. Rubio replied: ""He's not going to be the nominee. The Republican Party will be split apart if he became the nominee.""Underlining the back and forth between the Trump and Rubio camps were two acts of political insult theater.Mr. Rubio suggested Mr. Trump urinated on himself during Thursday's Houston debate and accused him of being a ""con man"" who employs illegal immigrants to write his tweets.Mr. Trump responded by calling Mr. Rubio a ""nervous Nellie,"" a ""lightweight"" and a ""choker."" On stage with Mr. Trump in Fort Worth, Texas, Mr. Christie chimed in, calling Mr. Rubio ""desperate.""And in what may encapsulate the 2016 Republican primary better than any other moment, both Messrs. Rubio and Trump mocked the way the other applies makeup.Mr. Rubio's late offensive against Mr. Trump serves as his likely last chance to stop the billionaire from running away with the party's nomination with a series of victories on Tuesday.The sharp exchanges also framed Mr. Rubio as the front-runner's chief antagonist and alternative, a position for which he has been battling Mr. Cruz in recent weeks.Still, it comes late in the process, well after Mr. Trump has established himself as the undisputed GOP leader, and having gone nine full months without facing sustained attacks from any of his viable opponents in the field.For the first time in the campaign, Mr. Rubio offered an extended attack on Mr. Trump directly and by name from his campaign stage. In a merger of social and traditional media, Mr. Rubio read misspellings from Mr. Trump's Twitter feed in a rally broadcast live on cable television.""He called me Mr. Meltdown,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""Let me tell you something. Last night, during one of the breaks, two of the breaks, he went backstage. He was having a meltdown. First, he had this little makeup thing, applying like makeup around his mustache, because he had one of those sweat mustaches. Then he asked for a full-length mirror. I don't know why, because the podium goes up to here, but he wanted a full-length mirror. Maybe to make sure his pants weren't wet, I don't know.""Mr. Christie, who eviscerated Mr. Rubio during a New Hampshire debate earlier this month, said he backed Mr. Trump because he would run an unconventional campaign that would surprise Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. ""The best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November on the stage last night is undoubtedly Donald Trump,"" Mr. Christie said.After announcing Mr. Christie's endorsement, Mr. Trump slammed Mr. Rubio as unprepared and incapable of being tough enough to be president.""I watched a part of his little act, and he's a desperate guy,"" Mr. Trump said at a press conference in Fort Worth, Texas. ""He is not presidential material -- that I can tell you. Doesn't have the demeanor. He is a nervous Nellie. I watch him backstage. The guy is a total mess.""Establishment GOP figures, who for months have privately pleaded for a candidate to attack Mr. Trump, cheered Mr. Rubio's offensiveon Friday, even as they bemoaned the increasingly nasty politics that are ensnaring the party.""I am excited to see Marco Rubio try to expose the fraud that Donald Trump is,"" said Jack Oliver, who served as national finance co-chairman for the Jeb Bush campaign. ""The problem is that this is an American election with global consequence, and every time I turn on the television, I feel like I'm watching a reality TV show.""Meanwhile, Mr. Cruz found himself largely blacked out from Friday's nonstop cable news coverage that carried the Rubio and Trump events and press conferences live.Campaigning in Nashville, Tenn., Mr. Cruz warned that if Mr. Trump, who has won the last three contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, does well in theMarch 1states, there will be nothing between him and the GOP nomination.Mr. Cruz, who has placed third in three states in a row after winning Iowa's caucuses, insisted that he is still relevant in a Republican race increasingly focused on Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio.""I don't doubt that the media will do everything they can to frame the race as anybody but the proven conservative with a conservative record"" versus Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz said.---Janet Hook and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

Election 2016: Trump Resists Calls for Tax Data,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768288008?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is resisting calls to release his tax returns as his chief rivals prepared to disclose theirs as soon as this weekend.Mr. Trump, the New York real-estate developer and reality-show star, insisted he wouldn't release his returns while he was being audited, as he said he has been every year for more than a decade.""Nobody would ever put out their returns that's under an audit,"" Mr.Trump said in a CNN interview after Thursday night's debate.""You're in the midst of negotiating and talking to the IRS.""There is no legal rule that would stop a person from releasing tax returns while under audit, said Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen, who said he was prohibited from commenting on any individual case.Mr. Koskinen also said it was unusual for anyone to be audited repeatedly in back to back years.""Usually when there's an audit, and it's cleared up, if there are no other issues, it's a number of years, two or three at least, before you hear from us again, unless something in your next return pops up,"" Mr. Koskinen said Friday at a taping of C-SPAN's ""Newsmakers"" in Washington, which will air on Sunday. ""As a matter of just formal auditing, it would be rare.""There are perils for Mr. Trump in releasing his returns now.A release could effectively translate into crowd-sourcing his audit as reporters, tax lawyers and accountants plunged in and raised issues the IRS might have overlooked.""Why not release some older returns not under audit?"" saidJoe Thorndike, a historian who tracks presidential tax returns and noted that former candidate Jeb Bush released 33 years of filings. ""Couldn't Trump do a half-dozen at least?""Aides to Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio said they were planning to release their tax returns as soon as this weekend, putting additional pressure on Mr. Trump.There also are political risks for Mr. Trump.His tax returns could suggest that he is less wealthy than he claims or that he is able to report little or no taxable income through borrowing, aggressive use of deductions or other maneuvers.Mr. Trump has built his campaign around his business success and his claim of a $10 billion fortune.Independent estimates peg him as a billionaire, but not as rich as he says.Tax returns could puncture that image. Then again, he has survived more campaign controversies in a year than most politicians encounter in a lifetime.He already hinted that his tax returns might not show much income.""Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/someone's net worth,"" he said on Twitter on Thursday.The current spat echoes 2012, when Mitt Romney released a tax return in January while under pressure from his Republican competitors. He then spent the general-election campaign defending his 13.9% tax rate and fighting unsupported allegations from Sen. Harry Reid (D., Nev.) that Mr. Romney hadn't paid taxes for 10 years.This time, Mr. Romney is playing the role of antagonist, warning of a ""bombshell"" in Mr. Trump's tax returns and urging him to release them.Credit: By Richard Rubin",4/26/16
Election 2016: Candidates Shift Media Tactics --- Trump's free coverage spurs changes as other presidential hopefuls attempt to capitalize,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768287987?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has steamrolled Republican rivals who have spent far more on television ads, banking on his star power and mastery of the media to drown them out with free news coverage.The monthslong media blitz is a big reason Mr. Trump won three of the first four nominating contests and built big leads in many of the 11 states that award delegates this coming week on Super Tuesday.This shift away from traditional campaign ads has forced rivals to retool their own operations to be smarter about maximizing media they don't buy. The other Republicans can't rival Mr. Trump's celebrity, but they are looking for smaller ways to generate coverage that will reach their voters.In the most prominent example, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign relies on thick binders compiled by a team of data analysts to maximize the share of targeted voters the candidate reaches with every interview on cable- or local-television news.The data dictated which South Carolina television station scored the first joint interview with Mr. Rubio and Gov. Nikki Haley after she endorsed his presidential bid.The numbers also help explain why Mr. Rubio appeared on NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" the week before the Iowa caucuses and why he generally avoids ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC. The data also drove the campaign's decision to schedule one-on-one interviews with the ABC and CBS affiliates in Dallason Friday.The Florida senator took an even bigger leap this past week by ratcheting up his attacks on Mr. Trump during a Texas debate Thursday night and then repeating and broadening them at a rally Friday. His feisty performance was aimed at driving the news coverage heading toward one of the most important voting days of the primary.The 2016 White House race has upended one of the basic tenets of presidential politics: that the candidate with the most money controls the airwaves and campaign narrative.Instead, Mr. Trump has rewritten that playbook by relying on free media, or traditional news coverage, more than the rest of the field combined. So far this year, his brash talk and celebrity status have led to him being featured on the networks' evening newscasts nearly three times as much as his next-closest rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, according to the Tyndall Report, which logs network news.Campaigns and their outside allies spent $209 million on television ads in the run-up to the South Carolina primary, according to figures compiled by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. But the top spender -- former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, along with an aligned super PAC -- fell flat despite outspending Mr. Trump by 8 to 1. Mr. Bush dropped his bid after a disappointing fourth-place finish in South Carolina.It is hard to put a price tag on what this free media coverage has meant to the Trump campaign. Most of his appearances are broadcast live on cable news, and his remarks regularly result in additional coverage. A single 40-minute press conference on Feb. 15 translated to what would have cost $2.8 million in cable-news coverage, according to the team at Optimus, a data firm working with the Rubio campaign.The analysts at Optimus arrived at that figure by multiplying the time each major cable outlet covered the event with the average cost to advertise on each at that specific time of day. Coverage of the press conference itself exceeded $1 million, but the real value was that all three cable networks replayed snippets of his appearance throughout the day, driving up the value of the question-and-answer session for his campaign.On the Rubio side, a team of data analysts, fueled by Red Bull and Red Vines, huddle over computers in the Optimus office in downtown Washington, D.C., running every conceivable set of numbers about the 2016 presidential race. Their binders contain detailed data on polling, delegate math and which TV stations in, say, Atlanta or Nashville reach the largest share of voters Mr. Rubio is targeting in the primary.Those numbers shape tactics at Mr. Rubio's campaign headquarters a few miles away. His press team reviews the data every time they schedule an interview with the Florida senator. He did ""The Today Show"" on NBC the morning of the Iowa caucuses because it reaches, on average, 12,200 likely caucusgoers, far more than any other network.That same morning, he did ""Good Morning America"" on ABC because the local affiliate in Manchester, N.H., commands the biggest audience of likely primary voters. Mr. Rubio did an exclusive interview on ABC's ""This Week"" theSundaybefore the New Hampshire primary and let ABC correspondent Jon Karl ride on his bus with his family for the same reasons.""The numbers change with each state, and you have to readjust the focus, but efficiently managing Sen. Rubio's time in a crowded field is a key competitive advantage,"" said Mike Morgan, an analyst at Optimus who devised this technique with partner Brian Stobie.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",4/26/16
Trump Agonistes,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768287983?accountid=12768,"The Republican presidential race entered its blitzkrieg phase Thursday as Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz finally turned their fire on Donald Trump instead of playing for second place. The brawling was entertaining if often ugly, but the debate was important in surfacing the vulnerabilities that Democrats are sure to exploit if Mr. Trump is the GOP nominee.The debate marked the first competitive vetting of the businessman, who had remained untouched as the other candidates vied to become the last non-Trump standing. Or as Mr. Trump would put it, ""losers."" Messrs. Rubio and Cruz had to take on Mr. Trump, and now we'll find out if the New Yorker can take the same mockery he dishes out.---Start with his policy knowledge, which is thinner than topsoil and not as rich. Mr. Rubio challenged Mr. Trump to go beyond his stock line that he'd replace ObamaCare by allowing competition across state lines, which is a good idea but hardly sufficient as a reform. Yet Mr. Trump couldn't come up with another specific idea to expand private health coverage.This is typical of Mr. Trump, who told us in November that the voters don't care about policy details. But Americans want a President to know something about the biggest problems, and Hillary Clinton wouldn't let him get away with a simple soundbite. The exchange revealed that Mr. Trump doesn't like to work all that hard to learn anything new. He gets by on instinct and insult.Speaking of which, in Texas Friday Mr. Trump took his attacks on the press corps to a new level by promising to change the libel laws. ""We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected,"" he said, sounding like Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Ripping the press is old political hat, but it's not every day that a potential President promises to use government power to punish critics. This follows his attack earlier this week on the Ricketts family of Chicago for donating to a Super Pac that has criticized him. ""They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!"" he tweeted. Does he plan to sic the IRS on them?Meanwhile, Mr. Trump for the first time invoked the IRS as his reason for not releasing his tax returns. ""For many years, I've been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me,"" he said in the debate. ""I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years.""So is it 12 years of audits, or only two or three? And no matter the years, an audit doesn't mean he can't release his returns. The IRS explains on its website that ""most audits will be of returns filed within the last two years"" and ""if a substantial error is identified, the IRS will not go back more than the last six years.""So even if Mr. Trump wanted to keep his returns confidential during an audit, he could still release returns from the last decade. His resort to the IRS -- an agency most conservatives loathe -- is a political excuse and diversion. This reached almost comic proportions when he told CNN that he might be audited so much because he's ""a strong Christian.""Messrs. Rubio and Cruz said they plan to release more of their tax returns in the coming days. But Mr. Trump will delay releasing his as long as he can and then only snippets. He doesn't want voters to see how wealthy he really is -- or isn't.Most surprising perhaps was Mr. Trump's stumble on what is supposed to be his signature issue, illegal immigration. For months Mr. Trump has railed about illegals for committing crimes and stealing American jobs. Well, Mr. Trump doesn't practice what he's now preaching.According to a New York Times report, some 300 Americans have applied or were referred to work at Mar-a-lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, but 94% were turned down. The resort filled the slots with foreign guest workers. Mr. Trump explained there aren't enough ""qualified"" Americans to go around, especially in season, and that without these foreign workers ""you hurt your business."" Wait a minute. That's our argument for immigration reform and more legal immigration. Mr. Trump fails his own immigration test.Sen. Rubio also brought up the illegal Polish workers Mr. Trump brought in to demolish the New York building replaced by Trump Tower. Mr. Trump has said he didn't know these workers were illegal, and that he wouldn't settle the legal claim against him on principle. But settle he did, in an agreement that remains under seal.---Mr. Trump realizes the debate might have done some damage, which you can tell from the ferocity of his counterattack. On Friday he called Mr. Rubio a ""lightweight choke artist,"" a ""liar,"" and ""a little boy on stage."" He also rolled out an endorsement by Chris Christie, who immediately attacked Mr. Rubio.The New Jersey Governor's talk as a candidate about the importance of ""executive"" experience would suggest he'd support Ohio Governor John Kasich. But Mr. Christie must have concluded that Mr. Kasich can't win, and he shares Mr. Trump's ideological, er, flexibility.All of this drama comes late in the race, and it's possible none of it will stop Mr. Trump's momentum. But it's important for Republicans to hear this record because they certainly will hear about it from Democrats if the GOP makes Mr. Trump their standard-bearer.",4/26/16
Election 2016: Trump's GOP Foes Face Tough Test,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768102884?accountid=12768,"The best hope Donald Trump's three nearest rivals have of slowing the billionaire businessman's march toward the Republican presidential nomination lies with the voters who know them best.Sen. Ted Cruz has to beat him in Texas on Tuesday, followed by March 15 victories for Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida and Gov. John Kasich in Ohio. If they each fail to win their home states, the delegate math suggests Mr. Trump may be impossible to stop in the race to collect the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the GOP nomination. In the latest polls, Mr. Trump is leading in Florida and Ohio, and trailing in most polls in Texas.The New York developer figures to win a host of the smaller states up for grabs now. If his margins are large enough, he can deny his rivals from scoring any delegates in those states. That happened in South Carolina. While the rules called for distribution of delegates based on the proportion of votes going to the candidates, Mr. Trump's win was so broad that he collected all 50 of the state's convention representatives.Riding high after victories in the last three contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, Mr. Trump is the polling leader in states across the country set to voteMarch 1, including Massachusetts, Georgia and Alabama. Five of six Texas surveys conducted this week showed Mr. Cruz ahead, though the margin in the polls varied from 1 percentage point to 15. In a sixth poll, Messrs. Cruz and Trump are tied. ""It feels like a freight train,"" said GOP election lawyer Ben Ginsberg, who was counsel to the Mitt Romney 2012 campaign.Adding to the problems for Mr. Trump's challengers: The billionaire's strength in the first four states has left them arguing about their own viability and trying to deflect his insults, rather than breaking through with an issues-based pitch to voters.In the so-called Super Tuesday contest next week, each of 11 states set their own rules, and nine of them require a candidate to garner between 10% and 20% of the vote to qualify for delegates. There are 595 delegates at stakeon March 1.Mr. Kasich, according to the latest public polling, would meet the qualifying threshold for delegates only in Massachusetts. Mr. Rubio would miss winning any delegates in Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Texas and Vermont. Mr. Cruz would get no delegates in Alabama and Vermont. Mr. Trump would win delegates in every state, according to the polling.Mr. Cruz is handicapped by his own state's delegate allocation rules, and that means he not only needs to win -- his victory must be overwhelming.Texas awards a portion of its delegates, 47, based on who wins the state. A candidate can qualify for a share of the remaining delegates if he meets a 20% threshold of votes. The final 108 delegates are then awarded by congressional district, with three at stake in each of the state's 36 districts. If a candidate wins 50% in any district, he would take all three delegates.South Carolina has similar rules -- and Mr. Trump won every congressional district and statewide.Public polling suggests Mr. Cruz isn't likely to reach the 50% statewide threshold to take all 47 statewide delegates. The Real Clear Politics average shows him at 34% statewide, with Mr. Trump at 27% and Mr. Rubio at 18%, putting the Florida senator in danger of being shut out of the statewide delegates. Reliable public polling by congressional district isn't available.Messrs. Kasich and Rubio, if they can survive toMarch 15, have the advantage of their states holding winner-take-all contests, making it far easier to make up ground against Mr. Trump. Florida offers 99 delegates for the statewide winner and Ohio is worth 66.Both the Rubio and Kasich teams have expressed confidence they will carry their states. But both trail Mr. Trump in Quinnipiac University surveys releasedWednesdayandThursday. Mr. Trump leads Mr. Kasich in Ohio by 5 percentage points and Mr. Rubio in Florida by 16 points.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein",4/26/16
"Election 2016: Rubio, Cruz Take On Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768101208?accountid=12768,"HOUSTON -- With time running out to snap Donald Trump's winning streak, Republican rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz turned on the front-runner Thursday with attacks aimed at undercutting his signature claim to be the toughest candidate against illegal immigration.The last debate before SuperTuesday'sdelegate bonanza featured some of the harshest and most personal blows against Mr. Trump, who has won three of the last four nominating contests. He is favored to carry most of the 11 states awarding delegateson Tuesday, potentially tightening his grip on the nomination and further rocking the Republican political establishment he loves to skewer.Messrs. Rubio and Cruz sought to undermine Mr. Trump's credibility with conservatives on a range of issues, including health care, the national debt, the Supreme Court and foreign policy toward Israel.They also badgered him to release his tax returns, a demand Mr. Trump rebuffed because he said he is being audited, and questioned his Republican fidelity based on prior donations to Democrats. The tax questions came after the last Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, inserted himself into the race by calling on Mr. Trump to release his returns. ""He doesn't want to do it because presumably there's something in there that is bad,"" Mr. Cruz said.Mr. Trump responded that he has been audited every year for about a dozen years. ""I will absolutely give my return, but . . . I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.""The big question from the debate is whether the barrage of attacks came too late to derail Mr. Trump. There were hardly any new charges but they were distilled into a two-hour bazaar of shouting.Mr. Rubio, who had mostly avoided directly confronting Mr. Trump previously in his campaign, led the charge by reviving a decades-old charge that has gotten little attention in this campaign: a settlement for hiring 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make way for a Trump Tower in New York City.""You're the only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally,"" Mr. Rubio said.The New York businessman shot back: ""I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anyone.""The Florida senator also slammed Mr. Trump for hiring hundreds of foreign guest workers at his private Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. The New York Times reportedThursdaythat 300 U.S. residents have applied for jobs at the club since 2010 but only 17 have been hired. Meanwhile, the club has sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers in that time.Mr. Trump said he hired foreign workers in Florida because ""you could not get help"" from Americans for part-time, seasonal jobs.In the first debate aimed directly at a Hispanic audience, Mr. Trump didn't moderate his tone or walk back his proposal to force Mexico to build a wall to keep out illegal immigrants.Thedebate was broadcast simultaneously in English on CNN and in Spanish on Telemundo. Earlier Thursday former Mexican President Vicente Fox said flatly: ""I am not going to pay for that f---ing wall.""When reminded of that vow, Mr. Trump became defiant. ""The wall just got 10 feet taller,"" he said.A better prepared Mr. Rubio kept pouncing:""If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he will be using illegal immigrant labor to do it."" After Mr. Trump said he would be open to starting a trade war with Mexico, Mr. Rubio quipped, ""Your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.""Mr. Cruz also railed against Mr. Trump not only for hiring illegal immigrants but for contributing to Democratic candidates who backed a 2013 bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to earn citizenship. ""And in 2013, when I was fighting against the ""gang of eight"" amnesty bill, where was Donald?"" Mr. Cruz demanded.

Harry Reid's Trump Tax Defense,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768100986?accountid=12768,"To understand how much Democrats want to run against Donald Trump this November, follow Harry Reid. The Senate Minority Leader attacked Mitt Romney on Thursday for raising prudent questions about Mr. Trump's refusal to release his tax returns.This is the same Harry Reid who claimed in 2012 that he had heard from an ""anonymous source"" that Mr. Romney hadn't paid taxes in 10 years. The claim was almost surely a lie, and Mr. Romney later released his returns, albeit later than he should have in his presidential run.Mr. Romney, having learned from hard experience, was doing Republicans a favor this week when he told Neil Cavuto on Fox Business that Mr. Trump should release his tax returns as soon as possible lest we learn only after he is the GOP nominee that the businessman is hiding something.""The reason that I think that there's a bombshell in there is because every time he's asked about his taxes he dodges and delays and says, well, we're working on it,"" Mr. Romney said. ""Hey, we're not talking about the taxes that are coming due this year. Of course they're working on those. They won't be ready for months. We're talking about taxes already filed -- back taxes.""Mr. Romney added that ""I think there's something there. Either he's not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is or he hasn't been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay, or perhaps he hasn't been giving money to the vets or to the disabled like he's been telling us he's doing,"" he added.Mr. Trump responded with his usual Twitter insults and fury, which is what he also did to us when we said he should release his tax returns. Then Mr. Reid, of all people, came to Mr. Trump's defense by mocking Mr. Romney for raising the tax issue. ""Ha, ha. [Mr. Romney] never gave us his tax returns. Who was the brainchild that got him to do that? He gave us a summary,"" Mr. Reid said, according to Politico.That's another distortion, but note that Mr. Reid has nothing to say about Mr. Trump's taxes. That will come later -- after the New Yorker has the GOP nomination. Then Democrats will do the vetting on Mr. Trump that his Republican competitors have failed to do. This will include demanding to see his taxes and lying about them if he doesn't disclose them, long media exposes of his business bankruptcies, tearful TV ads starring the Trump employees who lost their jobs (complete with Mr. Trump saying ""you're fired!""), his many unsavory business partners, and so much more.For all of his Twitter rage, Mr. Trump knows his taxes are a legitimate political issue. That's why he keeps promising to release his returns even as he never gets around to it. On Thursday Mr. Trump tweeted ""Signing a recent tax return -- isn't this ridiculous?"" along with a photo of himself with a pen next to a yard-high stack of papers.Here's what's really ridiculous: Republicans handing the nomination to a candidate without knowing what they're buying.",4/26/16
Trump Is the Ultimate Insider,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1768100938?accountid=12768,"There's an old saying that ""to catch a fish, you need to think like a fish."" And there's a modern translation of that for today's GOP: To beat a Donald, you need to think like a Trump voter.We don't know if Mr. Trump is unstoppable, because nobody has actually gone after him. To the extent his Republican rivals have nipped at his heels, they've done it in obvious, conventional ways. They've argued he's not a real conservative. They've pointed to his lack of policies. They've worried about his temperament and electability. Those arguments probably do resonate with the 50% or 60% of the primary electorate who -- obviously and conventionally -- care about principles, and winning.But those arguments don't speak to Trump supporters. The Nevada entrance polls show the billionaire won voters who are angry with the federal government, who want an ""outsider"" in the office and who want ""change."" They don't care about policies. They want someone to ""stick it to the man.""And therein lies Mr. Trump's vulnerability. Because, you see, Donald Trump is the man. An outsider to the elite society that Washington inhabits? An avenging angel of a faltering working class? Laugh. Out. Loud. This is the man who was born to a silver spoon, who self-selected a life strictly in the company of the rich and powerful, and who built a fortune by using his connections and sticking it to the little guy.Of all the Republicans on the stage, he is the only insider. Ted Cruz is not to be seen regularly in the company of hotel and casino magnates, movie producers, celebrity athletes and others with privileged access to Washington brokers. Marco Rubio did not have Bill and Hillary Clinton at his wedding. John Kasich would have to beg for an audience with people who jump to return Mr. Trump's calls.It was amusing in the CBS debate on Feb. 13 to hear the titan complain that the audience was stacked with ""special interest"" donors. He'd know. He likely recognized them from lunches at his golf clubs. This is a guy so disconnected from and uninterested in the average American that he refers to his voters in generic stereotypes. ""I love the poorly educated,"" he gushed after the Nevada caucuses. You can almost picture him, like Felonius Gru in ""Despicable Me,"" surveying his crowds of identical Minions. Though at least Gru knew that one is named Kevin.Nor is Mr. Trump outside of, or even slightly opposed to, Washington business as usual. It's how he does business. Americans are angry at Beltway back-scratching, logrolling and backroom agreements. This is the art of the deal. In explaining his $100,000 contribution to the Clinton Foundation, Mr. Trump bragged: ""When they call, I give. And you know what, when I need something from them . . . I call them. They are there for me.""Where are the ads playing that tape? Where are the ads questioning whether a President Trump would turn down that buddy who asked to keep his federal Nascar-track-owner tax break? Or asking what he'd barter away in an ObamaCare ""reform"" deal? Mr. Trump will get stuff ""done"" in Washington, all right. He'd put today's backroom Beltway culture on steroids.And all the angry little people won't be Mr. Trump's concern. They never have been. His rivals have made much of the billionaire's attempt to use eminent domain to build a limousine lot -- knocking him on property rights. But the better version of the tale is of how the billionaire used city officials to condemn the house of an average American, further underwriting his casino business.This is a repeating theme. Mr. Trump likes to claim it was only ""killer"" lenders who lost their shirts in his Atlantic City casino bankruptcies. But state lawmakers have claimed that local, small- and medium-size business owners also got stiffed and hundreds more lost their day jobs. Mr. Trump by contrast sucked out his money and boasted about his ""great timing"" in ditching the investment.Or how about the thousands of average folk who poured their savings into Trump University, to attend what some participants, who are now suing, describe as sham real-estate seminars. (A Trump attorney has insisted ""no one was defrauded."") The Atlantic in 2014 reported on a 41-page ""playbook"" for Trump University, which directed school staffers to ""Set the hook"" and convince attendees to sign up for additional courses, like the ""Trump Gold Elite"" package at $34,995.You can bet all this is directly related to Mr. Trump's unwillingness to release his tax returns. The billionaire likes to suggest that release will be about proving he has lots of money. More interesting will be how he made and kept it. How many exclusive tax breaks and shelters and write-offs are nestled within? How many get-rich schemes? Who lost so that Mr. Trump could be a winner?In the rural America in which I grew up, conservatives like to apply a basic candidate test: Would I want to have a beer with that dude? (Barack Obama: No. Harry Reid: Ew. Hillary Clinton: Please.) Right now, a lot are thinking they'd enjoy knocking back a brewski with someone as colorful as Mr. Trump. What they seem not to have realized is this: Mr. Trump would never, ever have a beer with them. He's never been interested in people who can't help him -- 99% of America. And Coors Light doesn't come in gold cans.Mr. Trump's rivals have the means to slow him. But they'll first have to remember just who the voters are that they are talking to.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Insider or Outsider, They Like Donald Trump"" -- WSJ Mar. 4, 2016)Credit: By Kimberley A.

Trump Is Killing Cruz,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1767831850?accountid=12768,"Ted Cruz has to be wondering: What happened?In the wake of his third-place finish in Nevada, Mr. Cruz's case for himself is: Don't forget Iowa. He has come a long way.In the fall of 2013, the freshman Texas senator rolled the dice so boldly that the biggest congressional Texan of all time, Lyndon Johnson, would have been agog. Sen. Cruz, with the whole Republican Party raging at him, pulled off a shutdown of the U.S. government. He publicized the shutdown with a 21-hour speech on the Senate floor, attacking other Republicans for not joining his Pickett's charge against ObamaCare, then a federal law.Ted Cruz knew amid this GOP chaos that he was going to run for president in 2016. He had the game plan in hand.The plan was to make a household name for himself as the Republican Party's best-known outsider. A narrative back then held that a deep wave of anger at the party's leadership was building in the heartland. Ted Cruz was going to personally deepen the anger and then ride it.It would surface with a victory in Iowa, which he got, build in South Carolina, and then surge through Super Tuesday and especially Texas with an unstoppable number of Cruz delegates fished from this angry Republican sea of outsiders -- tea partiers, anti-immigrant voters, pro-Snowden libertarians, evangelicals and anyone foaming mad at Barack Obama. The mad-as-hell vote.It was a plausible primary strategy, elegant even in its mathematical inevitability, despite the crushed-glass content.Until Donald Trump stole the whole thing.Sen. Cruz, the self-designed outsider, is getting killed by the outsider from hell.Somewhere in the South on Super Tuesday Sen. Cruz may yet get back on track a plan that was going to let him thumb his nose at a resentful Republican Senate from behind that big desk in the Oval Office. More likely, Ted Cruz is about to join Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, Scott Walker and Chris Christie as a Trump trophy.But this one is different. If Ted Cruz falls, he'll take a lot of the activist right with him.This was never a one-man show. The Cruz strategy was supported by an array of political factions whose goal was to make the Cruz candidacy a vehicle for seizing operational control of the Republican Party.Those groups included political fundraising operations such as Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund, a variety of Web-based political entrepreneurs and white-hot radio.Because the goal was seizing political power, the pitch to audiences wasn't complicated. It was Us versus Them. We are ""real conservatives,"" and ""they"" are not. They are ""the Establishment,"" a term made up from nothing.The distinctions were also simple.Immigration: We are for ""controlling the borders."" They are for ""amnesty.""Trade: They are for trade promotion authority. Real conservatives are against TPA.Both are serious issues, but policy details were an impediment to the takeover.It was a kind of bitter fun while it lasted. It lasted until Donald Trump's June 2015 presidential announcement in which he said: I'm just gonna grab all of that stuff . . . and make it simpler.The Mexican-built wall, the Muslim ban, the trade war with China, whatever. By the time we all got to South Carolina, Donald Trump had transformed Ted Cruz and the ""real conservative"" insurrection into . . . the Establishment.He is killing them. He is reaping the politics they worked to sow -- on immigration, on trade and on inchoate anger.Exit polls show Sen. Cruz winning a plurality of the ""very conservative"" vote. But there aren't enough ""very conservative"" voters to win anything now because Donald Trump is siphoning 33% of everything else.The Cruz camp might argue that it has as much chance as Marco Rubio in a one-on-one contest against the Trump 33%. It's far from clear, though, that the Rubio-Bush-Kasich vote would default to Sen. Cruz. The Cruz media-support operation for years has ridiculed vast swaths of the Republican Party, including lifelong Reagan conservatives, as the abhorrent ""mainstream"" or the ""donor class.""The goal was to separate them from Ted Cruz. It worked.Also in pieces is the Cruz faction's takeover of the Republican Party, what's left of it. Conventional wisdom holds that the Trump insurgency is a hostile takeover of the GOP. It is not that.Donald Trump is properly understood as running an independent candidacy from inside the formal structure of the Republican Party, as Mike Bloomberg did to run for mayor of New York City. Nothing remotely resembling a political party is associated with Mr. Trump. If he loses the nomination or the general election, he will walk away from his Republican supporters by dawn. The GOP will look like a forest shredded by a tornado.Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich have to decide if the time has come to let Donald Trump define the Republican Party, or let the rest of the Republicans choose either him or someone else as the majority's choice for their nominee.Sen. Cruz already offered a defined choice for the Republican Party. Donald Trump owns that version. It's a little late for Mr. Cruz's Plan B.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",4/26/16
Election 2016: Cruz Blasts Trump as Their Feud Heats Up,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775773481?accountid=12768,"The personal feud between Republican presidential contenders Ted Cruz and Donald Trump took a nasty turn Friday with an exchange about charges of marital infidelity and a new round of insults between the two candidates' camps.Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, used an impromptu press conference in Wisconsin to bat down a National Enquirer article that cited rumors alleging that he has cheated on his wife -- and in the process accused Mr. Trump and his ""henchmen"" of driving the piece.Mr. Trump responded by denying any involvement in the piece.A race that began as a conversation about immigration, economic growth and conservative strategies for helping people at the bottom rungs of the country's socioeconomic ladder is, for the moment, being dominated by the increasingly personal back-and-forth between the front-runner, Mr. Trump, and the candidate with the next-most delegates, Mr. Cruz.The war of words about the Enquirer piece came a day after the two Republicans sparred over photos about each other's wives, an exchange in which Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump ""a sniveling coward"" for disparaging his wife. They also came two days after House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) implored members of both parties to be more civil and respectful.In reference to the piece about marital infidelity, Mr. Cruz said in a post on his Facebook page: ""I want to be crystal clear: These attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won't go.""That was one of several efforts Mr. Cruz made Friday to denounce the accusations -- though by commenting publicly, he thrust them directly into the campaign conversation.In remarks to reporters in Wisconsin, Mr. Cruz called the Enquirer piece ""complete and utter lies. It is a tabloid smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen."" Mr. Cruz noted that the article quoted an on-and-off Trump political adviser, Roger Stone, who left the Trump campaign in an acrimonious split last summer.In a Twitter post, Mr. Stone said Mr. Cruz's comments were inaccurate.Mr. Trump released a statement denying any role in getting the Enquirer piece published. ""I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week's issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it and have not, as yet, read it,"" Mr. Trump said.The sniping between the two candidates followed a segment Friday on CNN in which a Trump supporter accused a Republican strategist appearing on the air with her of having an affair with Mr. Cruz.Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump, angry over a super PAC's ad mocking his wife, Melania, threatened to ""spill the beans"" on Heidi Cruz as retaliation. Mr. Cruz reacted angrily, saying he had nothing to do the with the ad.The political dialogue between two of the three remaining Republican presidential contenders seems to typify the name calling and personal attacks Mr. Ryan decried in a speech earlier in the week.""It did not used to be this bad, and it does not have to be this way,"" Mr. Ryan said in a Wednesday speech delivered to congressional interns. ""We shouldn't accept ugliness as the norm.""Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",4/27/16

""I don't get angry often. But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that will do it every time. Donald, you're a sniveling coward."" He added that Mr. Trump should leave his wife ""the hell alone.""In advance of Utah's GOP primary this past Tuesday, a group unaffiliated with the Cruz campaign featured a racy photo from 2000 of Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, in an ad accompanied by the text: ""Meet Melania Trump, your next first lady. Or you could vote for Ted Cruz on Tuesday.""Mr. Trump took to Twitter to express his displeasure over the ad, blaming ""Lyin' Ted"" for the spot and threatening to ""spill the beans"" on Heidi Cruz, the Texas senator's wife, in retaliation.Mr. Trump continued his attack against Mrs. Cruz, sharing on Twitter an unflattering photo of her next to his own wife. The text ""No need to spill the beans, the images are worth a thousand words"" accompanied the photo. The ad was composed by a supporter of the real-estate developer.The two front-runners are entering a lull in a long GOP campaign season that appears to be turning increasingly personal. Wisconsin voters head to the polls onApril 5. After that, the next major contest is New York -- Mr. Trump's home state. There are no more additional Republican debates scheduled.Trump campaign senior adviser Stephen Miller said on CNN Thursday the unflattering photo of Mr. Cruz's wife ""speaks for itself.""""The Cruz campaign needs to tell the super PAC and its donors to stand down,"" said Mr. Miller about the group that sparked the fight. But it isn't clear that would even be possible -- super PACs are required by law to be run independently of candidates and campaigns.In media interviews, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz distanced themselves from the ad that sparked the controversy and said they had nothing to do with it, while Mrs. Cruz said, ""Most of the things that Donald Trump says have no basis in reality.""""Donald, real men don't attack women. Your wife is lovely, and Heidi is the love of my life,"" Mr. Cruz said on Twitter this week.The attacks between the two Republicans have drawn criticism from Democrats. Chelsea Clinton, who is campaigning in Wisconsin for her mother, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, addressed the back-and-forth. ""I think that the level of vitriol goes beyond anything that we certainly have seen in contemporary times in this election,"" she said, according to NBC News.Mainstream Republicans leaders have become more vocal in their backing of Mr. Cruz in recent weeks, as party officials look for ways to stop Mr. Trump. AskedThursday if he would support Mr. Trump should the businessman become the GOP nominee, Mr. Cruz sidestepped the question and instead predicted victory. ""I'm going to beat him,"" he said. ""Donald Trump will not be the nominee.""In an average of national polls, Mr. Trump is ahead of Mr. Cruz by 13 points, according to Real Clear Politics. In the delegate count, Mr. Cruz trails by nearly 300 delegates.Credit: By Natalie Andrews and Byron Tau",4/27/16
Election 2016: Questions Raised Over Trump's Plan for China Tariffs,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775707924?accountid=12768,"In a presidential campaign where both parties bristle with tough trade talk, no threats compete with those Donald Trump has leveled at China as part of a strategy to narrow the trade gap and bring jobs back to the U.S.""If they don't behave,"" the Republican businessman warned at a debate this month, Chinese companies under a Trump presidency could face tariffs of 45% on exports to the U.S.With Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and others also pledging punitive actions, the presidential campaign is putting the U.S. on a collision course with China over trade. Economists warn that a clash could backfire, reducing U.S. exports and putting one million U.S. jobs at risk.Brandeis University economist Peter Petri, well regarded among trade experts for his projections on the economic impact of trade deals, calculates that Mr. Trump's 45% tariff would trigger reverberations around the world. Goods produced in China could shift to other low-wage nations for export to the U.S., he figures. To block the imports fully would require the U.S. to create a global tariff wall of roughly 10% and higher margins on low-wage countries like Mexico, he said in a tabulation for The Wall Street Journal.Factor in the retaliation against U.S. exports that is bound to occur, concluded Mr. Petri, who said he doesn't advise any of the presidential candidates, and the U.S. merchandise deficit of $736 billion last year would actually grow by $67 billion.If the U.S. dollar appreciates just 5% during this time -- as often happens when global economic instability grows -- U.S. exports would be further battered and the trade deficit would increase by about $275 billion, he calculates.""High-tariff policies are like trade agreements running in reverse,"" said Mr. Petri. They ""shift jobs from more efficient export-oriented firms to less efficient import-competing ones, leading to lower productivity and probably wages."" The difficult transition could cost the U.S. even more than the one million jobs economists say are at risk, he said.Mr. Petri generally finds substantial gains from trade deals, a view that isn't uniform among economists. University of Maryland economist Peter Morici said the Petri analysis is a worst-case scenario. Mr. Morici said it was more likely that China would bend to U.S. threats and allow its currency to rise, rather than risk losing one of its largest markets, especially at a time when the Chinese economy is slowing.Should the yuan rise, Mr. Trump wouldn't need to resort to stiff tariffs. The Petri analysis ""tries to turn Trump into Frankenstein,"" said Mr. Morici, a former chief economist at the International Trade Commission, who said he isn't advising Mr. Trump or any other presidential candidate.Saber-rattling over trade isn't new in presidential campaigns, particularly on the Democratic side. But in a striking departure for a Republican, Mr. Trump has made threats against Chinese and Mexican imports a centerpiece of his campaign to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the ""trade-surrender crowd"" has long argued tougher trade policies would hurt the U.S. economy. ""But it is precisely because we have refused to enforce trade rules that our economy has been decimated,"" she said.Other candidates are making threats as well, though on a far smaller scale.Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, said she would impose sanctions on China and other nations for ""manipulating"" their currencies to gain an export edge. Her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has taken a similar position. Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich has said he would target China's currency practices but hasn't said how. None of the three has specified how large a tariff could be involved.The remaining Republican candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, has voted against punishing currency practices with tariffs and has warned that Mr. Trump's China trade policies would hurt U.S. consumers and risk a wider trade war.Zhu Haiquan, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said, ""High-quality and economical imported goods from China have brought substantive benefits to many American families.""(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Trump Is Right, the Chinese Really Are Mercantilists"" -- WSJ April 8, 2016)Credit: By Bob Davis",4/27/16

Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican presidential primaries have seized on the controversy in recent weeks.The woman, Tarla Makaeff, filed the lawsuit in 2010, claiming that Trump University defrauded students around the country and made false promises about helping them achieve financial success.A separate fraud lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against the now-defunct Trump University, seeking $40 million, is also pending.Lawyers for Mr. Trump have denied the allegations.Ms. Makaeff asked U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego to leave the lawsuit as a named plaintiff, saying Mr. Trump and his lawyers have used the perch of his candidacy to publicly demean her.Judge Curiel said he would grant her request, on the condition that lawyers for Mr. Trump be allowed to depose another plaintiff in the case. The judge also permitted lawyers for Trump University to introduce Ms. Makaeff's deposition testimony if the case goes to trial.Ms. Makaeff could still benefit if the remaining plaintiffs win, as a member of a class of people who attended Trump University workshops. Lawyers for Ms. Makaeff and the other plaintiffs declined to comment.""Neither pundits, counsel, or the parties anticipated the media obsession that this case would create due to Defendant Trump becoming a candidate for President of the United States,"" Judge Curiel wrote in his order.

An appeals court ultimately dismissed the defamation claim, ordering Mr. Trump to pay her just under $800,000 for legal fees.Mr. Trump has decried Ms. Makaeff at rallies, and he tweeted this month, ""The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case.

Don't Coddle Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775301907?accountid=12768,"At the March 10 Republican debate in Miami, Donald Trump said ""I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win"" -- meaning that if no candidate holds a majority at the GOP's Cleveland convention, the nomination should go to whoever has a plurality.A majority, The Donald said, is an ""artificial number that was set by somebody."" But decrying the use of what he called a ""very random number"" is not just whining; it is a demand for radical change.How radical? The rule that the Republican nominee must win a majority of the national convention has been in force for 160 years, since the party's first convention in 1856 selected John C. Fremont as its standard-bearer. Five Republicans who went on to become president trailed in the convention when voting began.In 1860, New York Sen. William H. Seward topped the first ballot with 173 1/2 votes, 60 short of a majority. Abraham Lincoln was behind with 102. His managers feverishly worked the convention's anti-Seward majority and, probably with the help of promises of patronage, Lincoln closed the gap on the second ballot and won on the third. Angry, a quarter of the delegates stayed with Seward and the convention ended in a split. Still, Lincoln prevailed and became the nation's savior.In 1876, Maine Sen. James G. Blaine led on the opening ballot, and Ohio Gov. Rutherford B. Hayes was a distant fifth. But the Ohioan moved up to third place on the fifth ballot and grabbed a majority on the seventh.Four years later, former President Ulysses S. Grant attempted a comeback after leaving office in 1877. He led the convention for two days through 34 ballots. But on the 35th, delegates began rallying to Ohio Rep. James A. Garfield, who was not even a candidate when the convention began. After one more ballot, Garfield was the GOP nominee.In 1888, Ohio Sen. John Sherman was the front-runner, but his campaign faltered. This gave an opening to Indiana Sen. Benjamin Harrison, who was in fifth place on the initial ballot. Harrison began moving up on the third ballot and was nominated on the eighth.The 1920 convention was initially led by Gen. Leonard Wood, who had organized the Rough Riders with Theodore Roosevelt and served as Army chief of staff. Wood had nearly a third of the delegates on the first ballot. In sixth place was Ohio Sen. Warren Harding, who trailed the pack until he moved into third place on the seventh ballot before being nominated on the 10th.The last time that the Republican who started with the most delegates failed to win the nomination was 1940, when Manhattan District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey led for three ballots -- until former Kansas Gov. Alf Landon met with Minnesota Gov. Harold Stassen in a freight elevator behind the stage. The two men then threw their support to utility executive Wendell Willkie, who won on the sixth ballot, beating not only Dewey but also Ohio Sen. Robert Taft.On the other side of the aisle, three Democratic presidents -- James K. Polk in 1844, Franklin Pierce in 1852 and Woodrow Wilson in 1912 -- were nominated after trailing in early balloting. Five other Democratic nominees lagged behind when voting began. The last was in 1952: Adlai Stevenson did not compete for the nomination before the convention.Mr. Trump is probably correct that if he falls short on the first ballot by only a handful of votes, 20 or so, he is the likely nominee. But if he is down by a larger number, say 100 to 200, he could be in trouble. Mr. Trump surely knows this, which is why he threatened ""riots"" if he is denied the nomination.The reality-TV star also said the effect would be to ""disenfranchise"" his supporters. Nonsense. After all, following Tuesday's contests, Mr. Trump has received 37% of the votes so far. He has yet to break 50% in a single state. By the end of the primaries, most Republicans are likely to have voted for someone else. Would giving Mr. Trump the nomination ""disenfranchise"" them?Mr. Trump should stop demanding to be treated differently than any GOP candidate before him, including Abraham Lincoln. Rather than try to change the rules in the middle of the contest, he should focus on gaining the nomination outright by winning 55% of the remaining delegates. If he can't, he must convince the convention that he is worthy of a majority. Given how badly he does in polls against Hillary Clinton, that may be difficult.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Contested Convention: Past Results No Guide"" -- WSJ Mar. 30, 2016)Credit: By Karl Rove",4/27/16
Election 2016: Trump Coasts to an Easy Win in Arizona --- Majority of GOP in poll say that candidate with most delegates should get nomination,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775088651?accountid=12768,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Donald Trump won the Arizona primary on Tuesday, racking up another victory in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination before a monthlong period when GOP primaries will be fewer and farther between.The Arizona win could, however, be offset in later returns in Utah, where Mr. Trump was expected to lag behind rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in the GOP caucuses.Based on an overwhelming lead in early-voting results, the Associated Press declared Mr. Trump the winner in a state where his signature issue -- immigration -- was a top concern among GOP primary voters.Mr. Cruz came in second, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich trailed far behind. Because Arizona's primary runs by winner-take-all rules, Mr. Trump was awarded all 58 of the state's delegates to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter early Wednesday: ""Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!""Even with that victory under his belt and a big delegate lead over his rivals, Mr. Trump remains hundreds of votes shy of the 1,237 he needs to clinch the nomination.Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich are far behind, but they see in the states left to vote over the next two and a half months opportunities to win delegates and keep Mr. Trump from clinching the nomination outright.That is why, with more than half of the primary season behind them, Republicans are still facing the possibility that the race will end in a contested convention.What is even more unsettled is how the party's rank-and-file would react to such an outcome, and what that might mean for the eventual nominee's general-election chances.Mr. Trump has warned of a big voter backlash if he comes close to winning a majority but is denied the nomination at a contested convention.""If they do, I will leave the Republican Party,""said Candy Matteson, a retiree here who voted for the New York businessman. ""I would have no faith in them anymore.""Brian Richards, a Trump supporter here who works in real estate, criticized the plans of the Stop Trump movement to deny him the nomination at the convention.""I think it's a shame if they do,"" said Mr. Richards, 61 years old. ""I don't think anything in politics is fair, but I don't think it's right.""A new CNN/ORC poll found that GOP opinion is cold to the idea of a contested convention. Six in 10 Republican voters say that if no candidate has a majority of delegates at the convention, delegates should go with the candidate who had the most support.Predictably, opinions differ depending on candidate preference: 82% of Trump backers and 40% of other candidates' supporters don't want the convention to supplant the front-runner.The poll also found that most Republicans seem to want the primary season to end in a man-to-man fight: 70% said that Mr. Kasich should end his bid for the nomination now that it is mathematically impossible for him to win before the convention.Mr. Cruz and his allies have been arguing for some time that he would benefit from a two-man fight, which would allow him to consolidate support from anti-Trump voters like Scott Richardson, 67, a Scottsdale attorney who describes the possibility of a contested convention as ""fun.""""What I like about Cruz is that he's not Donald Trump,"" said Mr. Richardson. ""I think the office deserves more than Donald Trump.""Still, Mr. Kasich shows no sign of dropping out of the race and ceding the anti-Trump cause to Mr. Cruz, and it might take both of them to stay in for all of the remaining 20 states to collect enough delegates to stop Mr. Trump -- if they act as a tag team.Mr. Cruz is hoping to get a boost from Utah's Tuesday caucuses. He was backed by Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential candidate with deep roots in the state and its Mormon community. He also picked up the endorsement of Rep. Mia Love, a popular Utah Republican who had previously supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.After that, Mr. Cruz has a lot riding on winning in Wisconsin, the next state to vote, on April 5.Credit: By Janet Hook and Byron Tau",4/27/16
"Election 2016: Wisconsin to Test Cruz, Sanders --- Anti-Trump trend favors Texan, history of progressives bodes well for Democrat",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775087431?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin's primary, up next on the presidential nominating calendar, presents a key test for the second-place Democratic and Republican candidates: If Sens. Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz can't win there, they face a diminishing belief that they can win in states that follow.That is because both Mr. Cruz, who is chasing GOP front-runner Donald Trump, and Mr. Sanders, who lags behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic delegate count, hold distinct advantages in Wisconsin.With two weeks between Tuesday's contests in Arizona and Utah and Wisconsin's vote on April 5, the candidates will be able to put down roots in a way they haven't since before the February contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.Among the GOP, the action has already started. Mr. Cruz is scheduled to appear at a forum Wednesday in Waukesha County, a suburban Milwaukee area that is home to the state's largest concentration of GOP voters and crucial to any Republican's electoral hopes. He also announced four additional stops Thursday and Friday in Madison and the Fox Valley, the GOP-rich area between Milwaukee and Green Bay.To stress the importance of Wisconsin, the Cruz campaign put out a call for volunteers to come to the state to establish a ""Camp Cruz,"" which it hadn't done since South Carolina's Feb. 20 primary.""Cruz has an opportunity, but he also has a lot of work to do because most Wisconsinites don't know a lot about him,"" said Mark Graul, a veteran Republican operative from Green Bay who organized the state for George W. Bush in 2004.The state will award 42 Republican delegates and 86 pledged to the Democrats.For Mr. Trump, Wisconsin's population distribution poses a particular disadvantage. He is highly unpopular in the Milwaukee area, where local conservative talk-radio hosts have been lamenting his rise for months.An analysis by Marquette Law School of its recent poll, publishedSaturdayin the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, found Mr. Trump is viewed positively by just 25% and negatively by 64% of GOP voters in the three suburban counties that ring Milwaukee. But in nearly three dozen rural counties in the state's west and north, the picture is reversed: Mr. Trump's favorable ratings are 21 percentage points higher than his negative ones.""In southeast Wisconsin, the local conservative talk-radio hosts have not followed the lead of the national guys,"" said Charlie Sykes, who regularly criticizes Mr. Trump on his morning radio show in Milwaukee and is hosting Mr. Cruz at the Wednesdayforum in Waukesha. ""Trump has not had the talk-radio air cover here that he's had elsewhere.""Mr. Trump's Wisconsin footprint is light, and no significant elected official in the state backs his campaign. Mr. Trump's aides didn't respond to a request for his Wisconsin endorsements.But the New Yorker in recent weeks suggested putting a Wisconsinite on the Supreme Court: Judge Diane Sykes of the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The George W. Bush appointee used to be married to Mr. Sykes, the radio host.Almost the entire state GOP backed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's presidential bid, which he terminated in September amid low poll numbers. Mr. Walker hasn't endorsed a candidate since, and declined an interview request.For the Democrats, the latest polling shows an even race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator is extremely popular among liberals in and around Madison, where he held his first major rally, drawing 20,000 people in July. Wisconsin's demographics also tend to mirror those in neighboring Michigan and Minnesota, both of which Mr. Sanders won.Also helping Mr. Sanders is Wisconsin's history of backing liberal mavericks, going back to Sen. ""Fighting"" Bob La Follette, who founded the progressive movement a century ago. ""Time and time again in Democratic primaries we go for the person who is much more out there on the progressive end of it,"" said Thad Nation, who was an aide to the state's last Democratic governor, Jim Doyle.Mrs. Clinton has her own strength in Milwaukee, home to the vast majority of the state's blacks and Hispanics.And while Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have focused their ire of late on Mr. Trump, in Wisconsin they both figure to take aim at Mr. Walker, who remains a highly polarizing figure despised by activist Democrats.""Just mentioning Scott Walker will light a room on fire,"" said Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, who hasn't endorsed a candidate. ""For the base, that's filet mignon wrapped in bacon.""---Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein",4/27/16
"With Security Back in Focus, Trump, Clinton Win Arizona",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775087362?accountid=12768,"The deadly terror attacks in Brussels abruptly refocused the agenda of the presidential race Tuesday, jolting the dwindling group of candidates into a renewed debate over who was best-equipped to protect America.Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who won Tuesday's Arizona primary, suggested the attacks, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility, vindicated his aggressive rhetoric about Muslims and others. He also called for new laws that would allow torture when interrogating terror suspects. Leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who won her party's primary in Arizona, reiterated her experience as secretary of state and adopted her own tough tone by suggesting Europeans need to do more to control their borders.It was Republican Sen. Ted Cruz who offered the starkest new plan, suggesting police in the U.S. should more aggressively police Muslim communities. ""We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized,"" Mr. Cruz said.Under Mr. Cruz's plan, which Mr. Trump said he supports, the selection of which neighborhoods would receive increased patrols would depend on input from law enforcement, a person familiar with the proposal said.Some of Mr. Cruz's backers had questions about the plan. ""Generally every neighborhood is patrolled -- that's what local law enforcement does,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R., Kan.), who has endorsed Mr. Cruz. ""I'm not quite sure what he has in mind, but without a doubt there's been no greater defender, no constitutional scholar greater than Ted Cruz in this race.""The attacks came as Utah was also holding its nominating contest Tuesday, while Democrats in Idaho held their caucuses.This isn't the first time terrorist attacks have reshaped the contours of the presidential campaign. Deadly assaults last year in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., appeared to play to the strengths of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in their respective primary races.Recently, the focus had returned to subjects like trade and the economy, but the explosions in Brussels made each of the campaigns immediately pivot. Mr. Cruz, in second place to Mr. Trump by GOP convention delegates, held two news conferences. Mrs. Clinton made unscheduled television appearances and hastily scheduled a Wednesday speech at Stanford University on counterterrorism.Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, called on President Barack Obama to cut short his historic trip to Cuba to address the issue.The attacks have the potential to further boost Mr. Trump, whose tough talk and far-reaching proposals aided him following previous terrorist attacks. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that investigators should use harsh interrogation techniques to pry information from Salah Abdeslam, who was arrested in Brussels last week and is accused of taking part in last year's Paris attacks.""He may be talking, but he'll talk a lot faster with the torture,"" Mr. Trump said on CNN.Mrs. Clinton, for her part, said the U.S. needs ""to toughen our surveillance, our interception of communication"" in order to prevent new attacks.In calling for law enforcement to secure Muslim neighborhoods, Mr. Cruz waded into a policing tactic that some warned could further alienate religious minorities and violate people's rights.Lorenzo Vidino, director of the program on extremism at George Washington University, said it was wrong to portray entire neighborhoods as overrun by terrorist networks. ""This seems well beyond the scope, and can you imagine what kind of message it sends?"" Mr. Vidino said.The Cruz campaign rejected such criticism, saying law enforcement needed to act more aggressively and ignore ""political correctness.""Mr. Cruz added, ""If you have a neighborhood that is plagued by gang activity, it is standard and good law enforcement to stop the gang members and take them off the street.""The violent emergence of Islamic State in 2014, and its ability to inspire or direct massacres on five continents, has consumed law enforcement, intelligence, and military networks around the world. The next president will inherit these threats.In the days after the December terror attack in California, Mr. Trump galvanized support by proposing to temporarily stop the immigration of Muslims into the U.S. The proposal spooked many GOP leaders but appeared to resonate with many primary voters.The idea complemented other parts of Mr. Trump's foreign-policy platform, which would tighten U.S. borders and diminish engagement in the Middle East. On Monday, Mr. Trump took another step, suggesting the U.S. should contribute less to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and saying more of the NATO burden should be borne by European allies.Messrs. Cruz and Kasich pounced on that recommendation following the attacks in Brussels.""We must strengthen our alliances as our way of life,"" Mr. Kasich said in a statement.For Mrs. Clinton, the Brussels attacks force a direct confrontation with a thorny question -- how to balance the need for government antiterrorism surveillance with the privacy rights of Americans.Facing a liberal challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, Mrs. Clinton has long stressed the importance of civil liberties and the need for government restraint. In December, she gave a speech in Minnesota calling on the government and technology companies to ""start working together to keep us safe from terrorists.""But with Mrs. Clinton zeroing in on the Democratic nomination after several big primary wins over Mr. Sanders, she sounded more hard-line on Tuesday. ""I give quarter to nobody in being as focused as I can be,"" she said on CNN.Speaking in Everett, Wash., Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton took aim at Mr. Trump, alluding to the role of the Internet in terrorist recruitment. ""Some of my opponents want to build walls and shut the world off,"" she said. ""Well, you tell me, how high does the wall have to be to keep the Internet out?""She also sought to contrast her attitude toward American Muslims with that of the Republicans, saying Muslims could alert authorities to suspicious doings.---Josh Dawsey, Kristina Peterson and Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Credit: By Damian Paletta",4/27/16
Trump's Useless Revolution,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775086428?accountid=12768,"Trumpism offers nothing for Americans who are flocking to it as much in response to cultural anxieties as economic ones.A trade war with China will not bring back low-skilled, high-wage manufacturing jobs. On the contrary, Chinese workers themselves are being turfed out of their own factories by automation.Building a wall at the southern border won't hold back cultural changes in America from the fact that Hispanics are a fast-growing economic and cultural bloc. At the risk of putting ideas in his head, Donald Trump would have to increase the white birthrate and even then probably wouldn't change the emergence of an unfamiliar yet familiarly dynamic new America.Mr. Trump may well benefit politically from Tuesday's terrorist attacks in Belgium. In the long run, we will be thanking our lucky stars that we get our cultural renewal from largely Catholic immigrants from the south rather than the Islamic proto-majorities that, in the lifetimes of many of us, will fundamentally alter the character not just of the European Union (if it survives) but Russia.Mr. Trump's standpattism on entitlements and pensions implies economy-killing tax hikes down the road at both the federal and local level, which even then will not hold off the need to restructure these promises.Globalization will experience hiccups, as will the cultural evolution of the United States. But Mr. Trump and Trumpism aren't a solution to anything.True, some Americans have never been able to recapture the standard of living that their now-vanished factory job once gave them. But false promises won't help these people. Faster economic growth would help them; rearranging social programs that have contributed to the woeful decline in the readiness of people to move in search of a job would help.Andy Puzder, CEO of the company that runs Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, stirred up controversy by admitting the fast-food industry's interest in automation is partly driven by minimum-wage hikes. Fast-food jobs may not be anybody's ideal, but if you're new in town, it's a job that almost anybody can get.Berkeley's Alan Auerbach and Boston University's Laurence Kotlikoff, in a careful new study, show that the great inequality panic of 2016 is overblown. But they also highlight the ways welfare and tax policy impose high marginal rates at both ends of the income scale, discouraging work. Too many benefits for the poor and unemployed are effectively tied to place, so moving in search of a job means the safety net is yanked away just when it might help most to get a family back on its feet.We shouldn't fail to mention that the bipartisan obsession, in the 1990s and early 2000s, with luring low-income families to take out mortgages has also ended up hindering their ability to move in search of work.For 40 years, moreover, it has been obvious that the problem of chronic poverty, especially African-American poverty, is the problem of neighborhoods where crime, bad schools, lack of jobs and family breakdown undermine the existence and practicality of good behavioral norms. Champions of policies to help people escape such neighborhoods, rather than policies that pour money in, win every seminar but never win control of policy in Washington. Is that because lifetime, gerrymandered sinecures in Washington depend on preserving concentrated neighborhoods of black poverty?As Thomas Edsall points out in the New York Times, ""African-American voters have provided Democrats with their margin of victory in elections at every level across the nation, year after year. . . . How long can Democratic Party leaders and candidates continue to rely on African-American voters before African-American voters take matters into their own hands -- just as white working-class Republican voters have done this year?""The Trump phenomenon, we're told by those pro and con, signals a political realignment. Realignments, by definition, aren't confined to one party but signify a reshuffling of coalitions between parties. Hooray. Let's hope for the best.Voters are better at signaling dissatisfaction than thinking clearly about solutions. Democracy's great virtue is not the wisdom of voters' every judgment but the fact that an election is always coming, so voters can react against choices that are not working.The problem is matching the candidate who can capture the public's imagination with the policies that will actually improve conditions. Obama, in his 2008 race, fulfilled the first condition. Trump fulfills the first condition.Sadly, this year the two parties are converging on candidates who, in their different ways, appear unlikely to channel voter dissatisfaction into productive policies, though we should not rule out a pleasant surprise. Bracing up America's internal dynamism and prosperity is surely an urgent need. Most of all, it's needed so America can remain a bulwark in an increasingly dangerous and chaotic world.Credit: By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.",4/27/16
Election 2016: Trump Cancels Chicago Rally Amid Protests,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772780576?accountid=12768,"CHICAGO -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled a rally on Friday scheduled at a university arena in this Democratic stronghold as a young and rowdy crowd of protesters at times skirmished with supporters of the businessman.The confrontations come at a critical moment in the campaign, as Mr. Trump has pumped up his politically incorrect style to take on candidates more closely associated with elected officials in Washington. Mr. Trump is seeking to vanquish rivals Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, by beating them in their home states in primaries set for Tuesday.Yet, the escalating clashes at the Trump rallies are providing an opening for his rivals who argue that the celebrity businessman lacks the temperament to be president.Speaking to reporters after a rally at a glass factory in Moraine, Ohio, on Friday, Mr. Kasich said his own events have been held without incident.""We don't want to have violence at any rallies, we don't have them at our rallies,"" Mr. Kasich said. ""I just can't comment on what the heck has happened at his rallies. I haven't been to one, don't expect to go.""For Friday's rally, Mr. Trump picked an urban university close to some of city's largest Hispanic neighborhoods. His opponents responded by spending days preparing for his arrival, organizing demonstrations and scooping up tickets to his event. Such efforts included a Facebook campaign that had some 10,000 people respond.As protesters gathered outside, others went inside. Students said they used social media to organize at the university, as opposition on campus among faculty and students built in recent days. Some members of the crowd wore headscarves and Black Lives Matter t-shirts. One man stood in the middle of a section and tore up a Trump sign to loud applause.While there was some shouting between supporters and protesters, and a few people were taken out by police, the crowd was largely calm.Then a representative of Mr. Trump took the stage and announced the event was canceled because of safety concerns. Large swaths of the crowd erupted in cheers as Trump supporters stood stunned, only seconds earlier thinking the presidential candidate was about to take the stage.Ahmad Shuaibi got up on a friend's shoulders and bounced up and down to loud cheers around him. ""We shut down Trump, me and a group of my friends!"" he said.Hosam Sadek said he came just to see what would happen but didn't know what to expect. ""Turns out half were Trump supporters and half weren't,"" he said. ""This is the impact we wanted.""In an interview on MSNBC, Mr. Trump said he consulted with law enforcement before he decided to cancel the event.A spokesman for the Chicago police said the department wasn't consulted regarding canceling the event and didn't receive any credible threats before the event.The U.S. Secret Service, which is now protecting Mr. Trump, referred questions to the campaign.During a Republican presidential debate Thursday night in Miami, Mr. Trump disavowed any responsibility for violence at his events, blaming protesters who he said are intent on disrupting him.""We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things,"" Mr. Trump said. ""They are swinging, they are really dangerous, and they get in there and they start hitting people.""Credit: By Ben Kesling and Mark Peters",4/27/16
Trump Rivals Make a Last Stand --- Rubio campaign tells Ohio backers to vote for Kasich; Bush meets with three candidates,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772682818?accountid=12768,"MORAINE, Ohio -- Republicans' last-gasp effort to stop Donald Trump from seizing their party's presidential nomination kicked into high gear Friday, as his three remaining challengers avoided attacking one another, and their outside allies shifted money to states where each can take the most votes away from the front-runner.In the starkest illustration of the strategy, Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign urged Ohio supporters to back Gov. John Kasich, to keep the front-runner from capturing the winner-take-all state.""There's no question that John Kasich has the best chance to beat Donald Trump in Ohio,"" said Alex Conant, Mr. Rubio's communications director.""If you're a Republican primary voter in Ohio, and you don't want Donald Trump to be the nominee, John Kasich is your best bet.""The Rubio team's attempt to coordinate marks a recognition that Trump victories Tuesday in Ohio and Florida would give the New Yorker an unshakable grip on the GOP presidential nomination. The move comes a week after the party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, urged Republicans to vote strategically to block Mr. Trump's path to the nomination.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ended his candidacy last month after months of sparring with Mr. Trump, met with each of the three non-Trump candidates this week in Miami, though he hasn't offered direction on how to block Mr. Trump's path.Mr. Rubio himself allowed that Mr. Kasich is better positioned to win Ohio but stopped short of asking his backers to vote for someone else. ""If a voter in Ohio thinks that voting for John Kasich is the best chance to stop Donald Trump there, I anticipate that's what they will do,"" Mr. Rubio said.In recent days, Mr. Trump has been calling for Republicans to rally around his campaign. He has been talking up the increased turnout in GOP contests as evidence his campaign has the energy to win the general election.Not all of Mr. Trump's rivals were staying out of one another's way. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spent the morning at a megachurch in Orlando, Fla., rallying supporters in Mr. Rubio's backyard to turn out for him in Tuesday's big primary there. Mr. Cruz doesn't need to win the Florida contest, but his presence in the state is a clear sign that the Texan wants Mr. Rubio to lose so he can finally have a one-on-one matchup with Mr. Trump.""If you don't want Donald Trump to be the nominee and lose to Hillary [Clinton], then I ask you to join our team,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""We welcome you. The water is warm.""Still, Mr. Cruz is focusing his campaign efforts on two other big states voting on Tuesday, North Carolina and Missouri, where his campaign manager Jeff Roe is a veteran of hard-fought Republican politics. Mr. Cruz on Friday announced he will appear at three Missouri rallies Friday.One of Mr. Cruz's super PACs, Keep the Promise I, is airing a pair of TV ads in Illinois but in no other states. It is advertising on radio in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, a spokeswoman said.Ohio polls have shown a dead heat between Messrs. Kasich and Trump. A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Kasich leading. CNN released a survey Friday showing Mr. Trump ahead, though both candidates were within the margin of error in both polls.Mr. Kasich refused to reciprocate and rejected appeals to urge his Florida supporters to back Mr. Rubio there, where the home-state senator is polling second to Mr. Trump.""If I've got supporters somewhere in the country and I'm on the ballot, I think they kinda ought to go for me,"" Mr. Kasich told reporters after a rally in a glass factory here in Moraine. ""What kind of a deal would it be for me if I told my people, 'Don't vote for me?'""Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said that ""Sen. Rubio should immediately tell his super PAC to stop attacking the governor.""But Mr. Rubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions PAC, is giving Mr. Kasich plenty of breathing room in Ohio. The PAC is airing TV advertising this weekend only in Florida, and in Illinois, where delegates are elected directly by voters.For his part, Mr. Trump introduced his newest high-profile supporter on Friday, former candidate Ben Carson, who, like Mr. Trump, appealed to Republican voters eager for a candidate without political experience.While the Rubio campaign sought to lead the charge to join forces against Mr. Trump, the front-runner launched a new offensive against Mr. Kasich. After buying more Ohio TV time Thursday, Mr. Trump's campaign on Friday began airing an ad attacking Mr. Kasich for being ""an absentee governor, spending most of his time elsewhere, especially Michigan,"" a dig at the heated sports rivalry between the two states' universities.Mr. Trump also purchased Facebook ads this week that feature a video of his pregnant daughter, Ivanka Trump, saying, ""I'm incredibly excited that in the state of Florida, you're able to vote early."" She encouraged Floridians to cast ballots for her father by Saturday's early-vote deadline.Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois and Missouri all hold presidential primaries Tuesday, along with a caucus in the Northern Marianas Islands. Florida and Ohio, because they are in large states that award all of their delegates to the winner, have taken on more importance.Mr. Kasich has said that if he loses Ohio he will end his campaign. Mr. Rubio hasn't made the same commitment about Florida, but his campaign would be severely damaged if he doesn't win there.Mr. Trump heads into Tuesday's contests with 458 delegates. Mr. Cruz is second with 359. Mr. Rubio has 151 and Mr. Kasich has 54. Ohio will award 66 delegates to its winner, and Florida is worth 99 delegates. Missouri, North Carolina and Illinois have a combined 193 delegates, though none of those states are winner-take-all, meaning the delegates likely will be split among the four candidates.After largely avoiding direct attacks on Mr. Trump during Thursday's Miami debate -- the last opportunity before Tuesday's contests -- Messrs. Cruz and Rubio renewed their attacks on the New Yorker on Friday.---Rebecca Ballhaus, Beth Reinhard and Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

"Donald Trump, Meet Your Customers",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772417154?accountid=12768,"New York -- 'So you have the water, you have the steaks, you have the airline. I mean, what's wrong with selling?"" Donald J. Trump asked Tuesday in his remarkable election-night defense of his business empire. ""Every once in a while you can sell something. You have the wines and all of that, and Trump University, we're going to start it up as soon as I win the lawsuit."" He went on to invoke other ""assets"" including his hotels, Trump Vodka, the New York towers, the golf links and the Mar-a-Lago club -- but missed the opportunity to plug his Trump-branded neckties, restaurants, jewelry and mattresses.Mr. Trump says he's the candidate of the common man, and, well, the common man now regularly shares online his opinions of the stuff he buys. By coincidence, a few weeks before Mr. Trump's speech, I wondered what the amateur critics who contribute to websites like TripAdvisor, Yelp and Amazon were saying about his consumer-facing products, and I started to comb through their reviews whenever I had a spare half-hour.According to my spreadsheet, I've now read about 26,000 individual reviews. It has been slow, bleary-eyed scutwork, trust me, and remember, kids, this is what happens if you go into journalism.The digital portrait of Mr. Trump that emerges, review by review, is instructive, however subjective and impressionistic. You might call it an unscientific poll -- Mr. Trump's favorite kind -- of his achievements, failures and the relationship between his grandiosity and reality.---Mr. Trump was flanked on Tuesday by a pile of what he called Trump Steaks, but his mail-order beef business is defunct. The label on the steaks indicated that they were sold by Bush Brothers Provision Co., a West Palm Beach grocery.The reviews for Trump Steaks are still posted on the QVC website, however. One reports that the Classic Collection, which cost $199 for two filets, two bone-in rib-eyes and a dozen burgers, had ""no redeeming qualities."" ""Dreadful pieces of meat for a high price,"" reads another. ""It's hard to believe these are the same pieces that Mr. Trump eats.""Disenchantment with Trump food is a running motif. ""After all, how bad can a restaurant be that has Donald Trump's name on it?"" a TripAdvisor user wonders about DJT, a restaurant at Trump Hotel Las Vegas. ""Well, pretty bad,"" he concludes. ""Donald, they don't deserve your initials,"" somebody else says.Drinkers can also no longer enjoy ""Donald J. Trump: The World's Finest Super Premium Vodka, Success Distilled,"" which was discontinued in 2011, though it is unclear if anyone ever enjoyed it. A connoisseur at the website Vodkaphiles compares the flavor to ""gas station burritos, slightly expired 2% milk, hard boiled eggs, and canned pears.""Perhaps Mr. Trump's people simply have different preferences when it comes to the human senses. On a fragrances bulletin board, a reviewer says the notes of Success by Trump eau de toilette spray evoke adjectives like ""cloying, synthetic, annoyance, headache inducing and maybe even household cleanser."" Another chimes in, ""Maybe it could make the dumpster outside my house smell better, but I doubt it.""""We were almost violently ill from the smell,"" TripAdvisor's Rady reports about the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. ""The 'roof deck pool' was nothing but a used hypodermic needle collection area,"" notes Lauren W.Alas, the Taj is just another bankrupt AC casino, not another AC casino whose bankruptcy Mr. Trump caused. He took a buyout in 2009, and his trademark remains because the hedge funds that run the joint told a chapter 11 judge that they lacked the funds to change the ""ubiquitous"" Trump signage.This brings us to Mr. Trump's unconventional conceptions of ownership and property. Buildings he no longer controls live on in the Trump pantheon, sometimes because of insolvency but more often because he claims anything with his name on it is ""his."" Even companies he has nothing to do with can become Trump companies.Mr. Trump likes to boast that ""I have a store worth more than Mitt Romney"" -- as if the Gucci flagship that leases commercial real estate in Trump Tower agreed as a tenant to become the landlord's possession. If that's how it worked, at least it would explain this Yelper's outlook: ""99 Cent Store quality and even worse service.""True to form, this week I noticed that the ""Trump Restaurants"" section of the Trump Organization website claimed Daniel, the Upper East Side dining room that is among the world's finest. It has great reviews -- though I figured Daniel is no more a Trump Restaurant than Gucci is a Trump Store.A spokeswoman wrote back that the condo building where Daniel is housed is now managed by a different real-estate company and emphasized that the Trump Organization ""had no direct relationship with the restaurant other than as manager of the building . . . Daniel is not appropriately listed on the Trump website, which we are addressing with them now.""The Daniel trophy has disappeared from the Trump website, but I saved the screenshots.---Mr. Trump seems to do better as a hotelier than steak merchant, albeit with his usual overcooking. ""I mean, Chicago, I have one of the greatest buildings, rated the No. 1 hotel in North America, and I'm very proud of it. It's great, great,"" he said Tuesday.Yet Trump International Hotel & Tower isn't even the greatest hotel in Chicago, according to TripAdvisor. Users rank the place No. 12, behind the Langham (the winner) and the Talbot (the runner-up), as well as the mass-market chain Radisson Blu Aqua (No. 11).Then again, Mr. Trump's celebrity and mythology profoundly shape perceptions of his properties. ""You really do feel as rich as Donald Trump is when you come here,"" explains Valerian L. ""Trump knows how to entertain his rich guests,"" Petras B. says. ""I'm not one of them, but it's nice to pretend.""Amelia568 even says the Trump Hotel Collection delivered ""the most amazing experience of my life!!!"" She adds that ""One special feature among too many to mention was Trump Tower Sparkling Water! I am quite an expert in this field and this was the best in the world!"" The point goes to Mr. Trump.One takeaway is that reviewers are as willing to overlook Mr. Trump's politics as GOP voters are. ""Trump, himself, is horrible, but man, are his hotels nice,"" Ghia G. writes. Alma L. adds, ""As much as I despise Donald Trump, this has to be one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at.""A few did seem to dislike Trump hotels because they disliked the man. Brett M. says the Trump Ocean Club in Panama ""is a bit like Donald Trump himself: showy and full of flashy style and big rhetoric, but almost wholly lacking in substance and attention to detail.""In general, a consensus jells about the merits of Trump properties, which fall into the upper half of the ratings distribution on both TripAdvisor and Yelp. It's weird the bathrooms in the guest rooms of the Trump Soho don't have doors. Trump Las Vegas is too far from the strip. Guests like the welcome letters from Mr. Trump that are left on the beds. Trump International Hotel & Tower Waikiki Beach Walk sounds lovely.There is less unanimity about value for money. Reviewers conduct debates about whether Trump accommodations, however opulent, are worth the high prices.""Pricey as hell -- but what do you expect? It's the Trump!"" notes Stephanie L. ""If you don't have the money to spend, go to a cheaper option."" Evelyn A. adds, ""I'm not going to pretend the price tag isn't etched in gold, but screw it. You're worth it!""Keri N. provides the opposing argument in a post on the Trump Las Vegas. ""While the hotel is nice, it's comparable to your average business hotel that you would find in any other city."" ""I travel a lot,"" remarks Mercedes M., ""and frankly, what you get at a Courtyard Marriott far exceeds what I've experienced the last couple of days.""Bill Z. puts it more bluntly in a post about Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto: ""At the risk of sounding condescending, I can't help but wonder how many of these five-star reviews were written by people who frequent five-star hotels on a regular basis and know what their expectations of such hotels should be. I do . . . As a hotel, the Trump is above average. As a five-star, elite luxury hotel, the Trump falls short.""Amid this conversation, one emotive word appears again and again, and that is ""splurge."" These reviewers are not regular patrons of establishments where the faucets are gold-plated, and they typically discuss one- or two-day getaways to celebrate a special occasion.""This is a place everyone should splurge on at least once in their lifetime,"" says a TripAdvisor user about the Trump Chicago. Another notes, ""For the average person like me, one would think it would be unaffordable and out of reach . . . I think once in a lifetime everyone should surround themselves with this kind of luxury. I was quite happy with the TV in the bathroom, so I could take a shower and continue watching my show I was watching in the bedroom.""The nature of luxury economics is that the more so-called Veblen goods cost, the more they are desired. Nearly all of the splurgers were satisfied, by their own testimony. But when you read person after person describing once-in-a-lifetime Trump purchases, it's hard to shake the woebegone impression they're being sold an overpriced caricature of what someone who is not rich imagines being rich would be like.---Deep into Amazon reviews of Trump apparel -- ""This shirt makes no pretense of being top quality. But it's not cheap garbage either"" -- I became fatigued and decided I needed to give something back after taking so much. I went with a friend to get lunch at the notorious tourist trap that is the Trump Grill, in the gilded atrium of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. My review: This place couldn't make a Gentleman's C at Trump University.A lobster ravioli appetizer ($14) appeared to be frozen food, which offered reassurance: ""unlikely to be poisonous."" Meat was riskier. To the cows that gave their lives in vain for the Gold Label cheeseburger ($20) and the Trump Tower steak sandwich ($23), we apologize.Our glasses of ""red wine blend"" from Trump Winery -- a Meritage, the 2013 vintage ($11), and a 2012 New World Reserve ($16) -- also disappointed. The esophageal burns speak for themselves.Afterward we repaired to Trump Bar and did catch sight of Don Jr. The thrill was no compensation for my friend's signature cocktail, the Doral ($16), which he said tasted like the golf course it is named after. The Billionaire Martini ($20) was unworthy of a mere millionaire, much less the average-looking Americans who were opening their wallets for products that had been expertly hyped but couldn't deliver.

Can Trump Start a Trade War?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771388004?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is a businessman who gets things done, he keeps telling us. His prowess as a negotiator is central to his pitch for granting him the powers of the presidency to ""make America great again.""Not that he actually reminds us of any business great we've heard of -- Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jack Welch or Indra Nooyi, say. Nor does he attract endorsements from any. His latest claim to fame, in fact, was a TV show in which he acted out a lowbrow parody of a business titan.Countless have been the incoming emails suggesting that any doubts voiced about President Trump are but the wailing of a deranged and impotent ""establishment."" Countable -- in fact, the number is zero -- have been those laying out an actual case for a Trump presidency.As the polls keep telling us, Trump voters are Reagan Democrats -- that is, not conservatives but people who landed in the Republican Party because they were tired of being looked down on by liberals.President Obama's most immortal phrase may turn out to be one he didn't mean us to hear, accusing these voters of clinging to guns and religion. ""What's the matter with Kansas?"" Democratic gurus once asked, referring to the alleged blindness of the white working class to their own economic interests. In Donald Trump these voters have found a champion. His lip service to their social values may be perfunctory, but he gives full voice to their distrust of foreigners, minorities and the panoply of protected identity groups that Democrats worship. He also serves up the complete menu of protectionism-plus-welfare for the traditional working class that Democratic Party populists of the ""Kansas"" school once urged on their own party.Which brings us to an increasingly urgent question. What would President Trump do in office? He may be the narcissist his critics say, but he would arrive in the White House looking for something to do consistent with his promises and his supporters' expectations, and with his own penchant for action.His wall with Mexico may or may not be an intentionally symbolic figment of his imagination, but is not immediately actionable. Whereas, contrary to what you may have read elsewhere, President Trump would have considerable power to provoke trade wars to create an instant opportunity for his negotiating acumen.As the University of Houston's Brandon Rottinghaus and Wesleyan's Elvin Lim point out in a highly relevant 2009 paper, the Constitution may reserve for Congress the power to regulate international trade, but presidents increasingly have claimed ""delegated unilateral powers"" to issue proclamations under the 1974 Trade Act.That law is aimed at expanding trade and lowering barriers, but presidents have used it to justify trade-restricting actions by invoking unrelated laws instructing the executive to pursue some definition of the national interest.Though such proclamations can be overturned by Congress, they never are. And President Trump would find no shortage of recent statutes -- having to do with terrorism, pollution, cybersecurity, consumer safety, labor rights, etc. -- that he could plausibly cite as an excuse for unilateral action against trade partners.What's more, he would invoke an impeccable precedent, none other than Ronald Reagan, who, within weeks of taking office in 1981, imposed sweeping ""voluntary"" restraints on Japanese cars that amounted to price fixing for Detroit's benefit.Reagan further ""negotiated"" unilateral restraints on memory chips, forklifts, motorcycles, color TVs, machine tools, textiles, steel, Canadian lumber and even mushrooms -- any one of which, if done today, would likely hit our more interdependent and currently fragile global economy like a bombshell.Reagan never campaigned as a protectionist. He did not argue that America's problems were caused by other countries. Privately, his team excused his behavior as necessary to defuse protectionist rage in Congress while waiting for tax cuts and deregulation to waken America's animal spirits during a disastrous recession. Reagan also made sure the ""voluntary"" restraints were palatable to the Japanese, who, in return for going along, were rewarded with a share of the price-fixing profits at the expense of American consumers.Mr. Trump would be launching his trade war in a very different world, and as a solution to America's ills, so we can start ""winning again."" Since Reagan's day, the U.S. economy has grown 2.5-fold, but trade has grown eightfold. International capital flows, once a fraction of global GDP, now are a multiple of global GDP. Plus, today's economies are bogged down with debt. Markets might respond to an outbreak of Trump economic war in chaotic ways Reagan didn't have to worry about (until he did, with the 1987 crash).But here's the important point: Anybody who believes that a President Trump would land in office bound by checks and balances, unable to do much, is kidding himself. He would have all the powers he needs to take the U.S. and world economy on a wild ride from the moment he sets foot in the Oval Office.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: A Trade War Would Be a Losing Venture for Everyone"" -- WSJ Mar. 25, 2016)Credit: By Holman W.

The GOP's Trump Divide,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771387347?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump scored at least two more primary victories on Tuesday even as two new national polls revealed the deepening Republican Party divide over his candidacy. Political parties don't usually nominate someone whom half of their own voters view unfavorably, but that is where the GOP now finds itself.Mr. Trump's impressive victories in Mississippi and Michigan underscored his unmovable support with at least a third of the GOP electorate across the country. His Mississippi win was especially resounding with about 48%, as he won in a rout among voters who decided more than a month ago. He lost late-deciders to Ted Cruz, who finished second, but Mr. Trump again won in a conservative state that was supposed to be the Texas Senator's home field.The race was closer in Michigan, where Mr. Trump was held to about 37% but still won comfortably by taking nearly half of those who had decided more than a month earlier. He lost late-deciders to Mr. Cruz and John Kasich, according to the exit polls, but they were only a quarter of the Wolverine State electorate.This timing matters because the rest of the GOP field began to address Mr. Trump's political vulnerabilities only in the last two weeks. According to the Cook Political Report, citing the media consultants at CMAG, only 9% of all ads in the GOP race targeted Mr. Trump in the first week of February. That changed in the first week of March when nearly half of such ads hit Mr. Trump.The businessman derided the attacks in his hour-long, free-association press conference Tuesday night that covered everything from his golf prowess to defending the quality of Trump Steaks. But the real test of the message and impact of the ads against him will come next week in Ohio and Florida.A pair of national polls released Tuesday showed that Mr. Trump is increasingly disliked in his own party. In the Wall Street Journal/NBC survey, his net negative rating is now up to minus-39%. A new Washington Post/ABC poll found that only 45% of Republicans consider him ""honest and trustworthy"" and only 51% say they'd be satisfied with him as the nominee.The other striking result, in the Michigan exit polls and the two national surveys, is that Mr. Trump nearly always loses a hypothetical one-on-one matchup with each of the other GOP contenders. None of the three wants to get out of the race, however, and none of them seem to be practicing the strategic campaigning that Mitt Romney advised last week to deny Mr. Trump more delegates.Marco Rubio must win his home state of Florida, but Mr. Cruz wants Mr. Trump to win there to knock out the Florida Senator. Yet that could end up being against Mr. Cruz's long-term interest since it would mean 99 more delegates in the winner-take-all state for Mr. Trump.Mr. Kasich must win in Ohio, where he is a popular Governor, and he came on strong in Michigan to contest Mr. Cruz for second as we went to press. But he trails badly in the overall delegate count and he'd need a rush of new money to be competitive in the later states.All of which leaves Republicans with a frontrunner in Mr. Trump who divides his party almost as much as President Obama has divided the country for more than seven years. Mr. Trump once again called himself ""a unifier"" on Tuesday, but only after deriding, in no particular order, ""lyin' Ted,"" ""little Marco,"" Lindsey Graham, Mitt Romney, and more. Mr. Trump may win the nomination, but he'll need more than opposition to Hillary Clinton to close this Republican chasm.",4/27/16
"With Little at Risk, de Blasio Leads the Trump Bashing",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771387051?accountid=12768,"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio likes to talk about Donald Trump.Since Mr. Trump declared his run for the White House last June, Mr. de Blasio has said Mr. Trump's name at least 70 times at public appearances, written unsolicited statements attacking him, frequently analyzed his political chances on television and brought him up unprompted at public events.""This is unbelievable. It is disgusting. It's literally beyond the pale,"" Mr. de Blasio said -- without being asked last week -- about Mr. Trump not quickly disavowing support from a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. "". . . I don't ever want to do punditry, I want to note something though,"" he said, before going on to offer an analysis of Mr. Trump's strengths and weaknesses.While other mayors have opined on presidential elections, the sheer volume of Mr. de Blasio's words about Mr. Trump has been noteworthy.Like other New York politicians, the Democratic mayor has learned that discussing the Republican billionaire is a surefire way to attract attention in a year in which the political oxygen is largely being consumed by Mr. Trump.While Mr. Trump and Mr. de Blasio have long operated as public figures in New York City, the men don't know each other. There is apparently little love lost between them. ""He doesn't have a clue,"" Mr. Trump said of Mr. de Blasio on Monday in an emailed statement.Mr. de Blasio isn't taking any particular political risk with his criticisms of the GOP front-runner. Polls show that Mr. Trump isn't popular in his home city and that Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both would thump him in a general election in New York state.Mr. Trump has even given the mayor a rare point of agreement with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The governor has taunted Mr. Trump for vowing to build a wall on the border with Mexico, even though he vowed to not dissect the Republican field. ""Don't worry, it's a beautiful wall,"" Mr. Cuomo said in a mocking tone last week at a rally for Mrs. Clinton.New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has received attention for suing Mr. Trump and Trump University, and has outlined his case against Mr. Trump in TV interviews. In the statement Monday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Schneiderman a ""lightweight"" and said he was motivated by ""hate"" of Mr. Cuomo and wanting the governor's job. A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said the office looked forward to presenting its case in court.Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito convened a rally on the City Hall steps to decry Mr. Trump's comments about banning Muslims late last year, with some members skipping hearings on homeless policy. At least 50 news outlets covered the event. Council members asked the media to stop paying so much attention to Mr. Trump.""This is totally wild,"" said Eric Koch, Ms. Mark-Viverito's communications director, as he stood in the City Hall rotunda looking at the assembled cameras.Mr. Trump later attacked Ms. Mark-Viverito and linked her to Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Koch laughed when he saw Mr. Trump's statement and said it was a great day for his boss.The clashes between Mr. Trump and Mr. de Blasio involve two men who often seem like polar opposites. The brash billionaire often insults opponents in crude terms and is known to say whatever is on his mind. He is obsessed with pop culture and celebrity. Even as a presidential front-runner, he is surrounded by few aides and no pollster.Mr. de Blasio is careful in every public appearance, and aides and advisers have privately complained about his inability to make quick decisions. He is surrounded by political aides and consultants. He cares little about pop culture or celebrity.Mr. de Blasio and his aides are political junkies who read dozens of news outlets and political blogs, on alert these days for ammunition that can be lobbed toward Mr. Trump. The mayor's office has released unprompted statements on three occasions about Mr. Trump or his positions.He also has occasionally stopped to praise Mr. Trump, including when the candidate was hit for having ""New York Values"" by Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and for his position to close a tax loophole often used by hedge-fund managers.Still, Saturday night on MSNBC, Mr. de Blasio said Mr. Trump ""never shows up at anything in this city"" and doesn't represent ""New York values.""Before Mr. de Blasio took office, Mr. Trump said he expected he would be a good mayor. Asked Monday about Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Trump said through a spokeswoman that he was the ""worst mayor in the history of New York City.""""New York City is in big trouble and perhaps the Mayor's time would be much better spent reducing crime and taxes than attacking the only person who will Make America Great Again,"" Mr. Trump wrote in his statement, using his trademark campaign phrase.Credit: By Josh Dawsey",4/27/16
Donald Trump's Mexican Imports,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771386987?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is going to build a wall, and it's going to be a beautiful wall, and everyone will love it -- but it's also going to have one notable side entrance. To wit, the GOP frontrunner won't let Mexicans into America but he'll make an exception for Mexican drugs.Mr. Trump released a 10-paragraph health plan last week, perhaps in response to the criticism that he has no policy details. We'll discuss the complete outline at a later date, but one detail that leapt out for comment is his endorsement of foreign pharmaceutical importation -- an idea even liberals left for dead a decade ago. His campaign promises to ""remove barriers to entry into free markets,"" because ""allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.""Sorry, it won't. The U.S. maintains a ""closed"" drug distribution network of manufacturers, suppliers and pharmacies -- precisely because overseas drugs often aren't safe and dependable. Recent years have seen a proliferation of pill mills and forgery rings that slip counterfeit or adulterated products into global supply chains. The World Health Organization estimates 10% of drugs world-wide are bogus.In the case of Mexico, the U.S. State Department warns travellers that as many as 25% of the medications available south of the border are fake. The Los Zetas, Sinaloa and Juarez cartels have diversified their portfolios into deceptive pharmaceuticals. The modern ""closed"" U.S. system was created in 1999 because Southern California was awash with fraudulent black-market compounds smuggled from Mexico.But even the Canadian market is contaminated with counterfeits from China, India and Pakistan, where cooking pseudo-medicines is a cottage industry. Countries that don't respect intellectual property also tend not to invest in the security and enforcement to protect it -- with patient safety as collateral damage.We suppose we should be grateful to see Mr. Trump discover a trading relationship he can support, but this one wouldn't cut drug costs. Almost nine of 10 U.S. prescriptions are already bargain-priced generics, and in free markets consumers typically decline to buy potentially life-threatening drugs of unknown origin and quality.New drugs are price-controlled in foreign markets, but drug makers aren't going to ramp up sales in Ireland or Mexico so their products can be diverted to the U.S. Journal contributor Scott Gottlieb also points out that the money to inspect imports -- and translate the labels into English -- erases any modest savings.Mr. Trump is a business nationalist without a core philosophy of government, so his policy arc is going to be an adventure. But some of his voters might be surprised to learn that he wants to flood the U.S. with cheap Mexican goods and other dangerous foreign imports.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Donald Trump Has a Point About Our Imported Drugs"" -- WSJ Mar. 23, 2016)",4/27/16
"Trump Tightens His Grip on GOP --- Businessman wins big in Mississippi and Michigan, but Sen. Cruz takes Idaho primary",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771383473?accountid=12768,"Businessman Donald Trump breezed to victory in Michigan and Mississippi Tuesday, overcoming heightened attacks by his Republican detractors to move one step closer to clinching the party's presidential nomination.The twin victories give Mr. Trump a boost heading into the main event -- winner-take-all primaries in Ohio and Florida on March 15 that will determine the fates of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was neck and neck with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for second place in Michigan.""There's only one person who did well tonight,"" Mr. Trump said, in an election night rally and news conference. ""Donald Trump.""But Mr. Cruz won in Idaho, bolstering his argument that he is the party's chief alternative to Mr. Trump. Idaho marks the seventh state the Texan has won, the most of anyone in the GOP race other than Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump predicted he would defeat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the general election and touted his recent conversation with House Speaker Paul Ryan, whom he said ""could not have been nicer.""The New York businessman sought to position himself more as a party leader and team player, saying he would work to elect Republicans to the House and Senate this summer and fall and calling for the party to unify behind his candidacy.""It's very, very important as a Republican that our senators and our congressmen get re-elected,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that the spike in GOP turnout in the primaries prompted mostly by his candidacy would help all GOP candidates. ""We have something going that's really good. We should grab everybody and unify the party.""Mr. Trump's victories came despite sustained attacks by his rivals and other leading voices in the GOP, including the party's last two presidential nominees. By winning Michigan, Mr. Trump prevailed in the home state of Mitt Romney, days after the 2012 nominee publicly rebuked him.The New York businessman also proved again Tuesday that he could beat Mr. Cruz in a Southern state where the Texas senator had invested time and money. More striking is that Mr. Trump outpaced Mr. Cruz among white evangelical Christians in Mississippi, a critical demographic for the latter. But Mr. Cruz beat the front-runner among those evangelicals who wanted a nominee who shared their beliefs.The results Tuesday escalate pressure on Messrs. Kasich and Rubio on the cusp of must-win races for each. Both have guaranteed victory over Mr. Trump in their home states. But the two Republicans looked like they might not qualify for a single delegate in Mississippi, and Mr. Rubio was in danger of not qualifying for any delegates in Michigan, casting fresh doubts on his candidacy.Mr. Kasich's battle for second place in Michigan gave him justification to carry on his candidacy into Ohio next week. Messrs. Trump, Kasich and Cruz will likely split most of the state's delegates.Support for Mr. Kasich has doubled in the past month, with 22% of GOP primary voters favoring the Ohio governor, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. The survey suggests Mr. Kasich has benefited from other Republicans dropping out of the race, attracting the lion's share of their support and overtaking Mr. Rubio.Speaking to supporters in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Kasich said ""the people of America are beginning to hear"" his campaign's message and repeated his guarantee that he'll win his home state. ""Now the home court advantage is coming north and next week we are going to win the state of Ohio.""The picture is bleaker for Mr. Rubio, who appears to be falling far below the 15% threshold to qualify for delegates in either Michigan or Mississippi.Mr. Trump gently mocked the downward trajectory of Mr. Rubio's campaign since he began attacking him. ""See, hostility works for some people, it doesn't work for everyone,"" Mr. Trump said.Tuesday offered further evidence that Mr. Trump's message is resonating with GOP voters. Some 62% of GOP primary voters in Michigan supported his temporary ban on Muslims from entering the country, according to exit polls. In Mississippi, 75% of GOP primary voters backed the ban. What's more, 59% of Republican primary voters in Michigan said they feel ""betrayed"" by Republican politicians.As has become his tradition, Mr. Trump marked election night with a news conference at a Trump-owned golf course, this time in Jupiter, Fla. He tinged his victory speech with mentions of at least nine different Trump-branded products or properties.Mr. Trump's victories come after television advertising spending against him dramatically increased, according to data from Kantar Media CMAG. In the past week, 62% of GOP spending on TV ads is for commercials attacking Mr. Trump -- up from 15% during the first week of February.In his victory remarks, Mr. Trump dismissed the TV assault against him. ""What this shows, really more than anything else, is that advertising really isn't as important as competence,"" he said.Mr. Trump has now won 14 of the first 20 GOP nominating contests. As of early Wednesday, he led the GOP field with 446 delegates. Mr. Cruz was at 347, Mr. Rubio at 151 and Mr. Kasich at 54. A candidate needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the Republican Partys nomination.The Florida and Ohio primaries, the first in the nation to award all of their delegates to the winner, will determine whether Mr. Trump has a glide path to the GOP nomination or if his three rivals are able to force him into a contested convention in Cleveland in July. Florida will award 99 delegates to the winner and Ohio 66 delegates to its first-place finisher.Missouri, North Carolina and Illinois also hold primaries next Tuesday. In Illinois, most delegates are elected directly by voters in each congressional district. North Carolina and Missouri award delegates proportionally based on the result statewide and in each congressional district. The three states have a combined 193 delegates.Even though the candidates haven't yet concentrated their campaigning in the March 15 states, a significant amount of the electorate in each state already has cast ballots.In Florida, roughly 700,000 Republicans and about 550,000 Democrats have voted early in-person or by absentee ballot, according to the Florida Division of Elections.In Ohio, 167,697 Republicans have already voted absentee, according to figures released Tuesday by Secretary of State Jon Husted. That's well above the pace ahead of the state's 2012 primary.In North Carolina, 75,322 people have already cast GOP presidential ballots, the State Board of Elections said. In Illinois, more than 315,000 people have already voted, though the state Board of Elections couldn't detail how many voters chose Democratic and Republican ballots.Mr. Kasich's supporters say they are encouraged by the Ohio early-voting numbers, even though Mr. Trump has done far better than his rivals with voters who made up their minds well before Election Day.In Louisiana's primary, Mr. Trump defeated Mr. Cruz by 24 percentage points among voters who cast absentee ballots, but Mr. Cruz finished first among voters who went to the polls on Saturday.""We've been running free and clear down the field toward the goal line without anyone else even competing,"" said Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges, who is backing Mr. Kasich.

Election 2016: Trump's School Drew Complaints,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771382649?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- The Better Business Bureau said Tuesday it had received ""multiple customer complaints"" about Trump University and that its rating with the business service group had sunk aslow asa ""D minus"" in 2010.Trump University -- called Trump Entrepreneur Initiative by the time it closed in 2011 -- has proven to be a thorn in the side of Donald Trump as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination. He faces lawsuits from former students of the for-profit real- estate school and from New York's attorney general.At Thursday's GOP debate in Detroit, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio attacked Mr. Trump over the school. Mr. Trump said the school had a 98% approval rating from former students and an ""A"" rating from the Better Business Bureau.On Tuesday, Claire Rosenzweig, chief executive officer of Better Business Bureau Serving Metropolitan New York, said the school earned an ""A"" rating in 2014 after it had ceased to operate and customer complaints had stopped counting against it. That eventually rose to an ""A plus,"" the group said.Mr. Trump and his campaign say the school had refunded tuition to unsatisfied customers, and that many of its students praised the program. On Monday he criticized two former students in a video released by his campaign. ""They just want to get their money back,"" Mr. Trump said in the video.Beyond the dispute with the Better Business Bureau, Mr. Trump faces a legal battle over the school he and his associates founded in 2004.Credit: By Heather Haddon",4/27/16
Election 2016 -- Analysis: White Males Propel Trump -- and Sanders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771382643?accountid=12768,"Tuesday's primary elections underscored an emerging, central reality of the 2016 presidential campaign: This is the year of the angry white male.Those white males are the voters who propelled Donald Trump to convincing victories Tuesday in Michigan and Mississippi, as they have elsewhere. And they may determine whether he can roll on next week in a series of big industrial states.Here's what is less noticed: Dissatisfied white males also helped propel Sen. Bernie Sanders to a stunning victory over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic contest in Michigan, and may keep him in the game for many weeks to come.All of this further suggests they may be the swing voters who decide the general election in November, when the critical question could well be whether Democrats can win enough of them to supplement their big advantages among women and minority voters.The effect was most obvious in watching Mr. Trump roll up two more big wins Tuesday. In Michigan, 52% of the Republican primary electorate was male, exit polls indicated. Mr. Trump won them going away, 43% to 23% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Meantime, he lost among women, 30% for Sen. Ted Cruz to 28% for Mr. Trump.The story was similar in Mississippi. Mr. Trump won men by 20 percentage points, exit polls indicated. There, he won women, but by a mere 9 percentage points.So, the more male the Republican electorate, the better for Mr. Trump. Also, the angrier as well.In Mississippi, 41% of Republicans described their feelings toward the federal government as ""angry"" -- and Mr. Trump won a whopping 57% of them. Meanwhile in Michigan, 32% of Republican voters said they were angry at the federal government, and Mr. Trump won 48% of them, compared with 24% for Mr. Cruz.And what are these folks angry about? Here's a pretty good clue:When voters were asked in Michigan if trade with other countries creates jobs or takes away jobs, just over half of GOP respondents said it takes away jobs -- this is in the Republican Party that once was the bastion of strong belief in free trade. And among those who see trade as a job killer, Mr. Trump won going away, 42% to 23% for Mr. Cruz.Here's a bit more evidence that the Trump army is made up of people angry over the belief the economy has left them behind: Among white college graduates in Michigan, he lost to Mr. Kasich. But among whites without a college degree, he won by almost 20 percentage points.Perhaps more interesting, angry white males are sustaining the Sanders campaign, not just the Trump campaign.In Michigan, they kept him nearly even with Mrs. Clinton, offsetting her big advantage among women and among minorities. Among women, exit polls indicate, he finished just behind Mrs. Clinton. But among men, he won easily, 54% to 44%.Like Mr. Trump, he seemed to do especially well among those who consider themselves stuck outside the economic mainstream. Among those who considered income inequality the top issue, he beat Mrs. Clinton 60% to 39%. And among those who think trade takes away jobs, he won 56% to 43%.Together, in other words, Messrs. Trump and Sanders are collapsing what had become, in the 1990s, something of a bipartisan consensus in favor of free trade. And angry white males, many of whom feel trade has marginalized their jobs and prospects, are leading the way.In the end, it may well be that these voters are sufficient to propel Mr. Trump to the GOP nomination; we may well know for sure after primaries next week in the big industrial states of Ohio, Illinois and Missouri. But they probably aren't enough to carry Mr. Sanders to the Democratic nomination.Which would set up a fascinating fall battle. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, Mrs. Clinton beats Mr. Trump in a hypothetical election matchup, 51% to 38%. But among white men? He wins comfortably, 53% to 35%.Could he hold on to such an advantage, and build up elsewhere? Or would she eat into and undermine his clearest pillar of strength? On such questions may November's outcome be decided.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",4/27/16
Trump Aims to Extend Reach,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771109372?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's march toward the Republican presidential nomination faces new tests on Tuesday in Michigan and Mississippi, states where rivals John Kasich and Ted Cruz are betting their regional appeal will serve as an antidote to Mr. Trump's outsider campaign.Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, is basing his candidacy on how he does in his home state's March 15 primary, and is counting on performing well in a string of coming Midwestern primaries. For Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, Mississippi represents the last of the Deep South states he once hoped to sweep on his way to the nomination.Mr. Trump has so far won every Southern state by large margins, except for Louisiana, where a surge by late-breaking voters on Saturday pushed Mr. Cruz to within 3 percentage points of the front-runner.Meanwhile, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, after engaging in taunts with Mr. Trump last week, has suddenly become almost an afterthought. He is fourth in Michigan polling, below the 15% threshold to win any delegates from the state. Mr. Rubio did take Sunday's Puerto Rico primary, bringing his winning tally to just two of 20 contests held so far.On Tuesday, Michigan will award 59 delegates. Another 40 are at stake in Mississippi, 32 in Idaho's primary and 19 in Hawaii's caucuses.Tuesday's contests will serve as an opening act to the next GOP main event -- the March 15 winner-take-all contests in Ohio, which will award 66 delegates, and Florida, which has 99.Mr. Trump leads the GOP field with 384 delegates. Mr. Cruz is second with 300 delegates, Mr. Rubio third with 151 and Mr. Kasich has 37. It requires 1,237 delegates to clinch the party's nomination.The New York businessman has handily led every public poll of Michigan Republicans this year.The state's early-voting numbers also presage a strong Trump showing. By Monday morning, more than 236,000 Republicans had already voted, a number that would be about one-quarter of the 2012 GOP primary turnout, according to figures from the Michigan secretary of state's office. Michigan's GOP early-voting turnout is up 18% from four years ago.In other states, Mr. Trump has done well in early voting only to have other candidates surge on primary day. In Louisiana, Mr. Trump beat Mr. Cruz 47% to 23% among votes cast before Saturday's primary. But Mr. Cruz won votes physically cast at precincts, 40.9% to 40.5%.Monmouth University's poll of Michigan Republicans released Monday indicated that last week's raucous GOP debate in Detroit, during which Messrs. Trump, Cruz and Rubio attacked each other throughout, is having an impact on voters.Before the debate, Mr. Kasich's support stood at 17%, compared to Mr. Trump's 39% in Michigan. In the two days of voter surveys after it, the governor's support jumped to 26%, while Mr. Trump's fell to 32%. Mr. Cruz gained slightly and Mr. Rubio fell slightly, though the difference for both remained within the poll's margin of error.""We clearly have momentum going throughout the weekend,"" Kasich campaign strategist John Weaver said in a Monday interview. ""We had a lot of ground to make up on Mr. Trump, but I feel like we're going to have a pretty good night.""In Michigan, Mr. Kasich's team had more than 1,000 volunteers from Ohio knocking on doors and making phone calls this weekend. His top aides in the state speak of the same kind of end-stage momentum that propelled him to a second-place finish in New Hampshire.The Ohio governor is counting on performing well in the wealthy Detroit suburbs and the state's rural north, which he was the only candidate to visit, while Mr. Cruz has an advantage in the state's western half, where there are more socially conservative voters.""The fact that he's the only governor still in the field helps him,"" said Stu Sandler, a former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party. ""And he's definitely using the Midwestern thing to his advantage.""Looking ahead, ""a lot of people are watching what happenstomorrow,"" said Ken Blackwell, a Republican who served as Ohio's secretary of state and mayor of Cincinnati. ""If Kasich pulls one out of the hat in Michigan, that gives him some geographical bragging rights going into Ohio.""Meanwhile, polling has been scarce in Mississippi and Idaho, but Mr. Trump is expected to win both contests.Mr. Cruz initially canceled a planned Monday appearance in Mississippi because of illness, but later scheduled another stop in the afternoon to prevent a Trump event from monopolizing local news in the homestretch.State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who mounted a tea party-backed challenge to GOP Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014, is co-chairing Mr. Cruz's campaign. Mr. McDaniel stumped on Monday with Mr. Cruz, who also was endorsed by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant on Monday evening. Former Sen. Trent Lott backs Mr. Kasich.But endorsements haven't proven much help in the 2016 GOP race. Mr. Rubio had endorsements from the Kansas governor, one of its senators and local GOP icon Bob Dole and still placed a distant third inSaturday'scaucuses.""Trump is going to win Mississippi, there's no doubt about that,"" said Jackson-based GOP consultant Austin Barbour.Mr. Barbour, who was advising former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before he dropped out of the race last month, is personally undecided -- except for ruling out Mr. Trump, who he says isn't conservative enough.In Idaho, the Republican Party changed the nominating contest to a primary after Mitt Romney handily won the caucus in 2012. Mr. Rubio has visited three times, and drew large crowds of more than 1,000 people at two different stopson Sunday. Mr. Cruz and his father, Rafael Cruz, both campaigned in the stateon Saturday.""This will be the first year the model will be tested as to whether the primary is working and making Idaho more of a player and not just a flyover state,"" said Damon Watkins, the Republican national committeeman in Idaho, who is backing Mr. Rubio.---Patrick O'Connor contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

Blue-Collar Vote Key for Trump Win,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770825909?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's success in attracting white, working-class voters is raising the prospect that the Republican Party could attempt to take an unexpected path to the White House that would run through the largely white and slow-to-diversify upper Midwest.Most Republican leaders believe the party's best way forward in a racially transforming nation is to draw in Hispanic and other minority voters.But Mr. Trump's focus on stopping illegal immigration, as well as his coarse description of Mexicans and other groups, has produced an intensely negative image of his candidacy among Hispanic voters, hindering an Electoral College strategy that relies on them, a range of polling shows.Sen. Ted Cruz asserted himself over the weekend as the most-viable GOP presidential alternative by winning two states and finishing closer than expected to the front-runner in two others. The next states will test whether the newly intensified criticism of Mr. Trump's temperament, business record, and past association with Democrats is getting through to primary voters.For now, Mr. Trump leads the GOP race in convention delegates and states won, largely built on a cadre of supporters -- mostly white and without college degrees -- who are angry about economic stagnation and are drawn to his aggressive immigration proposals, among other stances.Some demographers and political analysts say Mr. Trump, if he wins the nomination, may boost voting rates among white, working-class residents in states where their turnout was low in 2008 and 2012. These include Pennsylvania and upper Midwest states such as Michigan, although a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday showed Mr. Trump trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton in that state by 17 percentage points in a potential general-election matchup.Some two million fewer whites voted in 2012 than in 2008, census data show. Turnout among white, non-Hispanic voters fell from 67% nationally in President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election bid to 66% and 64% in the following two cycles.Mr. Trump would face some tricky electoral math, however. In the course of motivating white, working-class voters with his controversial proposals,he also could prompt Hispanics, African-Americans and other minorities, as well as women, to vote in higher rates than might have been the case with President Barack Obama no longer on the ticket. Moreover, minorities are growing as a share of eligible voters.White voters are shrinking as a share of the potential electorate -- and yet, the actual number of white voters could rise if their turnout rates returned to prior levels.States that saw a downturn in white voting rates in recent years included those in the Rust Belt where a majority of eligible voters are whites without a college degree, an analysis by Brookings Institution demographer William Frey found. These included Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota.Some strategists say the falloff in white turnout rates reflects a relative lack of enthusiasm for recent GOP presidential nominees. A candidate such as Mr. Trump, they suggest, could boost turnout rates.""I think there is an opportunity for a hidden white vote to come out, especially among less-educated voters in these states,"" said Mr. Frey, who added that this week's Michigan primary could show the depth of Mr. Trump's appeal among them in Rust Belt states.A Wall Street Journal analysis of county-level data also suggests a large number of white, working-class voters are untapped by any candidate.In 125 counties in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- more than half of all counties -- the share of white residents without college degrees was higher than the state average, census data reviewed by the Journal show. In 94 of those counties, or 75%, voter turnout was below the state average.In Lawrence County, Ohio, 53% of registered voters cast ballots in 2012, according to the secretary of state, well below the statewide average of 70.5%. In Fayette County, Pa., turnout was 53%, well below the statewide average of 67.6%. In both counties, nearly three-quarters of voting-age residents are whites without college degrees.Many strategists say a route to victory through these states is implausible, as Mr. Trump is alienating some voters in the course of drawing in others. Mr. Trump ""is going to give up an awful lot of independents and upscale Republicans in his gains with less-educated and lower-income white voters,"" said Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster.Moreover, some GOP strategists worry that Mr. Trump' might boost African-American turnout.But others say it is too early to tell what the balance of support and opposition to Mr. Trump would be.""In Northern Virginia, where a lot of the swing voters are college-educated, suburban women, Trump might underperform,"" said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign manager and later a senior White House adviser. ""But in parts of the upper Midwest, in the Roanoke area of Virginia, you could see him over[perform].""For Republicans, pathways to an Electoral College majority are possible even without winning highly diverse Florida and without Colorado and Virginia.One path entails winning Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and either Wisconsin or Minnesota. Republicans in that scenario would also have to retain North Carolina.Still, if the next Republican nominee doesn't improve on Mitt Romney's 17% share of nonwhite voters in 2012, the GOP would have to win 65% of white voters, according to calculations by GOP pollster Whit Ayres, who is working with Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign.That is a tall order: In recent decades, Mr. Ayres has said, the GOP only once carried a share of the white vote that large -- in Ronald Reagan's landslide re-election of 1984. Mr. Romney carried 59% of the white vote and lost to Mr. Obama by 4 percentage points.Credit: By Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni",4/27/16
Trump's Billionaire Friends in Finance,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770825823?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's supporters are a collection of strange bedfellows. Among the most surprising: two billionaire financiers who teamed up against Mr. Trump in a legal battle less than a decade ago.More than six years ago, investors Carl Icahn and Andrew Beal joined forces in bankruptcy court to try to take control of Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc., a deal Mr. Trump opposed. Now as some on Wall Street and in the Republican Party are trying to derail Mr. Trump's campaign for president, the two billionaires are his most high-profile backers in the business community.""There are no hard feelings,"" said Mr. Beal, who endorsed Mr. Trump this past week. ""He's smart [and] gets things done.""Mr. Beal, who founded Dallas-based Beal Bank and considers himself a libertarian, said he believes Mr. Trump will be pro-business and can bring ""radical change"" to Washington. One example: Mr. Beal said he recently sent Mr. Trump's political-action committee a donation for $100,000. It was returned.""I have never had a politician give me my money back,"" said Mr. Beal in an interview. He previously backed Rand Paul, contributing $250,000, before the Kentucky senator dropped out of the race.Mr. Beal's reasoning overlaps with Mr. Icahn's. The 80-year-old investor has called Mr. Trump an outsider who can help shake up politics, similar to how Mr. Icahn tries to change companies.The men and real-estate investor Thomas Barrack Jr., who also endorsed Mr. Trump this past week, said the main reason they are backing the New York businessman is they are exasperated with career politicians -- and not necessarily because they agree with all of his policy positions.Mr. Barrack, founder and executive chairman of Los Angeles-based Colony Capital Inc., said he didn't think Mr. Trump would put into practice everything he has said on the campaign trail.""He would adapt and come to logical conclusions . . . that's my belief,"" said Mr. Barrack. ""The rhetoric that seems harsh would dissipate.""Their support for Mr. Trump contrasts with concerns from many in the business community who have said the candidate's economic ideas are impractical and his temperament unsuited to the presidency. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein last year said the image of Mr. Trump ""with his finger on the button blows my mind.""Lawyers for Messrs. Beal and Icahn also struck a different tone in 2009. In a court filing then, the lawyers contended that the Trump name may no longer be ""synonymous with business acumen, high quality and style, a luxury lifestyle and enormous success.""At the time, Messrs. Icahn and Beal were trying to take control of Trump Entertainment, which held properties in Atlantic City, N.J., after the company filed for bankruptcy, an effort that was ultimately unsuccessful.The two men both say they remained cordial with Mr. Trump throughout the litigation. Mr. Beal has even attended at least one Broadway show with Mr. Trump.""There was absolutely no animosity,"" Mr. Icahn said today. ""I respect him, and he made a good deal with [bondholders] and there's nothing wrong with that.""Mr. Beal was ranked No. 115 on this year's Forbes magazine list of the wealthiest people in world, which put his net worth at $9.9 billion.When Trump Entertainment filed for bankruptcy again in September 2014, Mr. Icahn succeeded in gaining control and settled another suit with Mr. Trump, letting the Taj Mahal continue to carry the Trump name. The company emerged from bankruptcy late last month, and Mr. Trump lost his small stake.In a news release this past week, the Trump campaign announced the endorsements from Messrs. Beal and Barrack. It quoted Mr. Trump as saying he was ""proud to have their support"" and also cited Mr. Icahn as a supporter.Over the summer, Mr. Trump declared that he would like to name Mr. Icahn Treasury secretary, much to the surprise of the investor who said at the time he didn't know Mr. Trump was even running for president.Mr. Icahn, a famous night owl in business negotiations, turned down the offer, joking he doesn't get up early enough for the job. But he expressed support for Mr. Trump's candidacy. It was a rare endorsement for Mr. Icahn, who calls himself a centrist and has historically donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle.The investor supports Mr. Trump's push to stop the tax-driven deals that have U.S. companies fleeing to other countries for cheaper headquarters. While he is a Wall Street trader, Mr. Icahn supports changing carried-interest taxes that help traders lower their tax bill on profits, saying that higher taxes for hedge funds could help shrink the wealth gap between the richest and poorest Americans.In October, Mr. Icahn said he would launch a $150 million political-action committee, his first major foray into lobbying in politics.In an interview at the time, Mr. Icahn said he immediately got pushback from fellow Wall Streeters, who angrily opposed Mr. Trump.Mr. Barrack said in an interview that he has worked with Mr. Trump on real-estate deals since the late 1980s, including selling him the famed Plaza Hotel in midtown Manhattan. Mr. Trump sold his interests in the hotel a few years later.Before getting into real estate, Mr. Barrack served as a deputy undersecretary of the interior in the Reagan administration.---David Benoit contributed to this article.Credit: By Rachel Louise Ensign, Craig Karmin and David Benoit",4/27/16
"Election 2016: Trump, Cruz Break From the Pack --- Weekend results add pressure on Rubio and Kasich to drop out if they lose at home",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770814989?accountid=12768,"The race for the Republican presidential nomination looks increasingly like a two-man contest between front-runner Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz after the pair split four contests over the weekend.The results ratchet uppressure on the two remaining candidates -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- to exit the race if they don't come out on top in winner-take-all primaries in their respective home states on March 15. Mr. Rubio got a boost Sunday with a convincing win in the Puerto Rico primary.Mr. Cruz on Saturday won GOP caucuses in Kansas and Maine and finished a closer-than-expected second to Mr. Trump in both the Louisiana primary and Kentucky caucus. The Texas senator, backed by a state-of-the-art voter-turnout operation, also trimmed the front-runner's delegate lead ever so slightly.In contrast, Mr. Rubio finished a distant third in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana and was the only Republican not to claim a delegate in Maine because he fell short of the 10% threshold required to qualify.Mr. Trump late Saturday called on Mr. Rubio to step aside so that the businessman could square off in a head-to-head contest with Mr. Cruz.""I think it's time for Marco to clean the deck,"" Mr. Trump said Saturday in West Palm Beach, Fla. ""I think it's time now that he drop out.""The Rubio camp has pushed back hard against any suggestion that he exit the race. The senator himself is predicting victory in Florida on March 15, and he told a group in Puerto Rico on Saturday night ""this map only gets better for us"" as the contest progresses.Rubio aides point out that, although Mr. Cruz has more wins, their candidate outpaced him in more populous primary states, including Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia.But public-opinion surveys suggest Messrs. Rubio and Kasich both have a lot of ground to make up. Mr. Trump boasts a double-digit lead in Michigan, which votes Tuesday, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll, followed by Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio and then Mr. Kasich.Public polling in Florida and Ohio isn't recent enough to reflect the current standings in the race, but an internal poll conducted for a group trying to deny Mr. Trump the nomination showed Mr. Rubio within striking distance of the front-runner. The Cruz campaign is trying to peel votes away from the home-state senator by opening 10 campaign offices in Florida.Mr. Kasich has expressed doubts that any of the four remaining Republicans would collect the 1,237 delegates required to claim the nomination before the party descends on Cleveland for its convention in July. Eager to justify his decision to stay in the race after failing to win a single contest, Mr. Kasich seemed to relish the potential chaos.""Think about how much education our kids are going to get, about the way in which we pick a president,"" he said in an ABC interview Sunday. ""I think it will be very cool.""The chief strategist for Mr. Kasich's campaign circulated a memo over the weekend arguing the calendar gets more favorable for the Ohio governor as the race moves northwest, making the case that Mr. Cruz needed to get more delegates from the mostly Southern and caucus states that voted early this year. ""No candidate is currently on track to win the nomination outright,"" wrote John Weaver, Mr. Kasich's top strategist. ""Our campaign is built for the long-term.""Mr. Trump's detractors have stepped up their efforts in recent weeks to blunt his momentum.The party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, delivered an extraordinary speech last week in which he savaged Mr. Trump's character and ridiculed his business success, asserting the billionaire inherited his father's construction company rather than built one.Our Principles Project, an outside group financed by some of the party's biggest donors, is in the middle of a $3.5 million advertising blitz in Florida and Illinois, which also votes on March 15.Florida and Ohio present the remaining contenders with sprawling battlegrounds that tend to require multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns. Mr. Trump has been able to forgo those political ads in earlier contests because of the saturation coverage of his campaign, a trend likely to continue.Despite trailing Mr. Trump in most public polls, Mr. Rubio should benefit from a proven network of support in the Sunshine State. In the earlier contests, he has outpaced his rivals with those voters who decided closer to the voting.Mr. Cruz was able to nearly catch Mr. Trump in Louisiana when voters on Saturday began breaking his way. The New York businessman managed to hold on because of a wide winning margin with those who had cast their ballots before Election Day.In Florida, early in-person voting started last week in some of the state's most populous counties. As of Feb. 24, about 430,000 absentee ballots already were cast, including 224,000 by Republicans, state records showed.Mr. Rubio must ""remind people why they voted for him in 2010,"" said Tre' Evers, a Republican political consultant in Orlando who initially backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before joining the Rubio camp.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",4/27/16
Streetwise: Why Markets Ignore a President Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770472404?accountid=12768,"Love him or hate him, few can ignore Donald Trump. Except for investors.Markets are showing no sign of concern about the potential election of a protectionist president who already has a poisonous relationship with the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, Mexico.The reasons traders are unruffled about a possible President Trump tell us a lot about how markets assess political risk.Start with the chances of Mr. Trump upgrading from what rival Marco Rubio has called ""Hair Force One"" to the real presidential jet: According to online bookmaker Betfair, Mr. Trump has a 24% chance of securing the White House. That is close to the 27% likelihood gamblers put on Britain voting to leave the European Union in June, so-called Brexit.While the U.K. referendum has electrified markets and hammered sterling, similar chances of a Trump victory have had no effect at all.Why not? A simplistic answer is that few big fund managers -- international types who mainly live in coastal cities or abroad -- believe Mr. Trump has any chance. The problem is these are the same type of people who play on political-betting sites in their spare time, while Betfair's odds come exclusively from people outside America because of U.S. gambling rules.A better answer is that the U.S. election isn't until November, while Britain's vote is in June. Traders tend to focus on the next thing in the calendar, and there is plenty else to worry about before U.S. voters head to the polls. This may sound like a cynical comment about short-termism in markets, but hard-to-assess political risks frequently are ignored entirely by traders until they become so obvious they can no longer be avoided.Recent examples include the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, when stock markets reacted only days before the vote, and the 2014 Scottish referendum on independence, ignored until it was just weeks away.Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at New York-based Macro Risk Advisors, asked clients about Trump risk and ""what people said was it's simply too far out for us to worry about.""The risk itself also is hard to assess. While both many in the Republican Party and the wider world are horrified at the idea of a president who promises to wall off Mexico and ban foreign Muslims from visiting the U.S., Mr. Trump has committed to few economic policies.Stephen Jen, founder of hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners LLP, says the market has reacted to Brexit and not Mr. Trump in part because they are the ""difference between personalities and institutions."" Brexit is about changing the legal and governmental framework for the U.K. Mr. Trump has put personality way above policies, but would sit in the same Oval Office as any other president, and like them be limited by Congress and the Supreme Court.""In developed markets you have very strong institutions and the personalities matter less,"" he said. ""In emerging markets, it's the other way round.""There is one final problem for investors who fear a Trump victory. How can they protect their portfolios against a President Trump? Suggestions have included buying gold, selling the dollar or betting on a pickup in stock-market volatility around the election.The problem is the market's muscle memory. When scared, investors tend to flock into dollars, the world's main reserve currency and home of its most liquid markets. This proved true even in late July 2011, when fear of a U.S. government default hit. Perversely, panicked investors piled into U.S. bonds and the dollar strengthened.A bet on a pickup in volatility might be a better choice, but is only for experts. It would pay off if worry rises as the election approaches, allowing a trader to take profits before -- if the polls and betting odds are right -- Mr. Trump ultimately loses.Mr. Chintawongvanich points out that the implied volatility derived from S&P 500 options is basically flat from the summer through the end of the year. Using the spread between options maturing before and after the election would be a bet on a rise in worry about Mr. Trump, but have the advantage of being hedged against any reduction in broader market concerns over China, European banks and recession.Those who agree with former Mexican Presidents Felipe Calderon and Vicente Fox that Mr. Trump is reminiscent of Adolf Hitler might think more serious measures are justified, involving tinned food and guns. Perhaps the place to hide out isn't a bunker in Utah, though. For $2.5 million, investors can be fairly sure of the benevolence of a future President Trump while watching the election from the spacious luxury of 401 North Wabash Ave., Chicago -- Illinois's Trump Tower.Credit: By James Mackintosh",4/27/16
Trump Is Attacked From All Corners,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175761?accountid=12768,"DETROIT -- Confronting a furious onslaught by his Republican rivals and the party establishment, front-runner Donald Trump struck back with a barrage of counterattacks at Thursday's debate, demonstrating the same bravado he showed before he had won a single vote.Although Mr. Trump is drawing closer to the nomination after victories in 10 states, and has said he would strike a more presidential pose, the New York businessman didn't ease up on his penchant for belittling his rivals, interrupting them and dismissing their criticisms.""I have heard Ted say . . . he is the only one that can beat me,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is running second in the delegate count. ""Just for the record, I have won 10. He has won three or four. So where does this come from?""Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who broke out as the toughest aggressor against Mr. Trump in the last debate, said he would prefer to have a policy discussion. But, he added, pointing to some of Mr. Trump's targets, ""if there's anyone who has ever deserved to be attacked that way, it has been Donald Trump.""In the end, though, all of the candidates vowed to support their party's nominee, no matter who is chosen.The raucous debate came just hours after the unprecedented spectacle of the last two Republican presidential nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, attacking the most likely future nominee as unfit for the White House.Mr. Trump is also facing millions of dollars in attack ads from a range of groups tied to the GOP political elite and conservative movement. Since Feb. 20, super PACs have spent more than $9.5 million attacking him -- more than was spent against Mr. Trump in the eight months after his campaign began.Mr. Trump called Mr. Romney a ""failed candidate"" and an ""embarrassment,"" and derided Mr. Rubio as ""little Marco."" When asked about his views toward white supremacists, a visibly frustrated Mr. Trump said he has repeatedly disavowed support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. ""Take a look at my Twitter account,"" he said.The window for slowing Mr. Trump's momentum is closing rapidly. On March 15, Mr. Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich face do-or-die primaries in their home states. Beating Mr. Trump in the winner-take-all contests would only allow them to fight on and try to eventually outmaneuver him at a contested convention. Losing to Mr. Trump would likely knock either candidate out of the race and tighten his grip on the nomination.Mr. Kasich, groping to find his way back into the top tier since his second-place showing in New Hampshire last month, pledged that he would win his home state of Ohio on March 15, and ""move all across this country.""He talked up his work as House budget director in the 1990s balancing the federal budget with President Bill Clinton, and his work in Ohio to rid the state of debt and move it to a budget surplus.""The reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear,"" said the two-term governor. ""They want change and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change . . . We're putting people in who don't understand compromise, they don't understand policy.""Mr. Cruz, riding high after collecting the second-biggest bounty of delegates on Super Tuesday, openly pleaded with Trump supporters to change their allegiance. ""I understand the folks that are supporting Donald right now. You're angry . . . He uses angry rhetoric,"" he said. ""You're not going to stop the corruption and cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain.""Mr. Cruz also pointedly questioned how Mr. Trump could defeat or challenge Democrat Hillary Clinton after he made campaign contributions to her 2008 presidential run. The front-runner said he did that as part of his business.Mr. Rubio has repeatedly sought to tarnish Mr. Cruz's victories by noting that the conservative firebrand won fewer states in the Deep South than once expected. But Mr. Rubio also disappointed on Tuesday, coming away with only a victory in the Minnesota caucus.A particular heated clash came when Mr. Trump was asked to defend his involvement in Trump University, where he faces litigation from students who claim they were defrauded. Moderator Megyn Kelly read aloud a court verdict that compared the plaintiffs in Mr. Trump's case to victims of Bernie Madoff, a former stockbroker who operated one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history.""He's trying to do to the American voter what he did to people who signed up for this course,"" Mr. Rubio said.Mr. Trump played down the lawsuit and sought to turn the tables on Mr. Rubio, saying he ""scammed the people of Florida"" by missing votes and committee meetings.As Messrs. Trump and Rubio brawled, Mr. Cruz sought to inject himself as a voice of reason. ""Let me just ask the voters at home: Is this the debate you want playing out in the general election?""In one of the few signs that Mr. Trump is softening his tone as he closes in on the nomination, he offered a change to the hard-line immigration policy at the center of his campaign. He said he was jettisoning his demand for fewer visas for high-skilled workers.""I'm changing. We need highly skilled people in the country,"" he said. The businessman also said it is important to remain flexible about policy positions to allow for a negotiated agreement to emerge in the end. Otherwise, he said, nothing gets done.Mr. Trump didn't betray any animosity during the debate toward Ms. Kelly, whom he once said had ""blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her -- wherever,"" when she asked him about disparaging prominent women at an August debate. Mr. Trump boycotted a Fox News debate in January, accusing both Ms. Kelly and the network of unfair treatment.Mr. Trump put down his rhetorical weapon with a gracious greeting. ""Nice to be with you, Megyn. You're looking well,"" he said.Ms. Kelly, however, didn't take it easy on Mr. Trump. She introduced video footage showing Mr. Trump's conflicting statements on former President George W. Bush's pretext for the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and the Syrian refugee crisis.Mr. Trump said he changed his positions when he learned new information. ""I changed my tune, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that,"" he said. ""I have a very strong core. But I've never seen a successful person who wasn't flexible.""Meanwhile, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson withdrew from the debate on Wednesday, saying that he didn't see a path to the nomination after disappointing Super Tuesday results.---Reid J.

"Christie Stands Firm on Trump, Finishing Term",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175587?accountid=12768,"Facing criticism for his out-of-state campaigning for presidential candidate Donald Trump, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday he wouldn't resign and defended his endorsement of the GOP front-runner.Mr. Christie, who ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination last month, dismissed claims he was shirking his responsibilities at home while campaigning for Mr. Trump.The governor said he is focused on state issues and planned to serve the remainder of his second four-year term, which ends in January 2018.""I'm here,"" Mr. Christie said. ""I'm back to work.""Mr. Christie's remarks came during a freewheeling, 104-minute news conference at the Statehouse in Trenton that sharply contrasted in tone and substance with an appearance Monday in which he declined to take questions unrelated to his nomination of a state Supreme Court justice.On Thursday, Mr. Christie denied he was dodging questions about his political activities and offered to answer all of the reporters' ""burning questions"" on any topic.Mr. Christie addressed his widely discussed appearance during Mr. Trump's Super Tuesday victory speech. At the event, the governor stood expressionless behind Mr. Trump, sparking a flood of online jokes that he was being held hostage and fueling speculation that he regretted his endorsement.On Thursday, Mr. Christie said ""you never look good standing behind someone.""""All these armchair psychiatrists should give it a break,"" Mr. Christie said. ""I wasn't being held hostage. I wasn't upset, I wasn't angry, I wasn't despondent.""Mr. Christie said he has been friends with Mr. Trump for 14 years and believes he is the best Republican contender to defeat Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Mr. Christie said he is supporting Mr. Trump even though he believes Mr. Trump dashed his own presidential ambitions. ""If he had not been in the race I would have been the nominee,"" he said.The governor said he didn't discuss nor does he expect a job in Mr. Trump's administration if the New York businessman wins.Mr. Christie, who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election, didn't dismiss the possibility that he would accept such a position. For now, the governor said he plans to enter the private sector when he leaves office.""That's my current intention,"" Mr. Christie said.This week, some state lawmakers, including Republicans, said the governor should step down if he continues to stump for Mr. Trump.One of those lawmakers, Republican Sen. Jennifer Beck said Thursday she was encouraged by the governor's remarks.""I am pleased that Gov. Christie reaffirmed his commitment to invest his time, energy and effort into the serious policy issues that New Jersey faces, and that his time will be spent here in our state,"" Ms. Beck said in a statement.Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat, called the news conference ""a complete show"" and said she has seen no signs that Mr. Christie is negotiating key state issues.""This was a press conference to rewrite recent history,"" Ms. Weinberg said.Ms. Weinberg said she still believes Mr. Christie should resign and is researching how to impeach him if he doesn't step down.Mr. Christie said Thursday he wouldn't resign and is committed to addressing New Jersey's challenges, including a possible strike by about 4,200 NJ Transit railroad employees. Mr. Christie said he is hoping to avoid a strike but wouldn't give in unconditionally to the unions' demands.""I represent the fare payers and the taxpayers who pay the cost of whatever contract gets put in place,"" he said.Mr. Christie's office said the governor called the news conference to discuss jobs and the economy. At the top of his remarks, Mr. Christie noted the state's unemployment rate now stands at 4.8%, down from nearly 10% when he took office in 2010, but he quickly pivoted to politics.The governor said he expected to continue traveling across the country for Mr. Trump, but that his travel would be significantly less than during his 2014 tenure as chairman of the Republican Governors Association or for his own presidential bid.""I am not a full-time surrogate for Donald Trump,"" he said. ""I don't have a title or a position in the Trump campaign.""For now, Mr. Christie said the only travel he has planned is a getaway with his wife next week to mark their 30th wedding anniversary.Thursday's news conference was his longest since the governor's January 2013 appearance to discuss the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. That event lasted about two hours.""There seems to a correlation between how much trouble he faces and how long his press conferences are,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. ""The more trouble he's in, the longer they go.""Credit: By Kate King and Heather Haddon",4/27/16
Election 2016 -- Analysis: Tables Are Turned on Trump as Rivals Go on Offense,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175565?accountid=12768,"For many months of Republican presidential debates, Donald Trump was in attack mode, while Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz tried to stay above the fray to appear substantive and presidential.On Thursday night, at the GOP's 11th debate, the roles reversed. Mr. Trump arrived as the front-runner apparently seeking to appear more presidential and prepared to begin a general-election campaign. Messrs. Rubio and Cruz, now in the attack mode, sought to prevent him from doing so.Neither side was completely successful. All of which left the fourth candidate on the stage, Ohio Gov. John Kasich shaking his head and occasionally sounding as if he had perhaps wandered into the wrong room by mistake.The Fox News debate in Detroit arrived at what may prove to be the campaign's most critical juncture, after Mr. Trump's victories on Super Tuesday moved him into a strong front-runner's position, but certainly not one that is invincible.A low-key effort by party leaders to stop him from taking the next step in a set of big-state primaries that are coming up -- in Michigan, Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Missouri -- had just hours earlier escalated dramatically, when 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney very publicly excoriated Mr. Trump as a ""fraud"" and urged a concerted effort to stop him.That Romney broadside hung over the debate as it began, and, inevitably, Mr. Trump was asked about it at the outset. Yet, except for a passing shot at Mr. Romney, Mr. Trump didn't take the bait, instead pivoting rapidly to repeat his promise to negotiate ""great trade deals.""As the night rolled on, he stressed his reasonableness and flexibility on, among other things, his signature issue of immigration. He said ""a little give and take"" on that subject is a good thing.He readily admitted he was reversing his position on the provision of H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, saying he now favored granting more of them. He said he would work with Congress, including with Democrats there. ""Part of the problem we have in Washington now is total gridlock,"" he said. ""We need to be able to get things done.""He even tried to retract one of the slurs he had thrown Mr. Rubio's way previously. ""I would really like to take that back,"" he said. ""He's not that much of a lightweight.""All in all, he sounded like a candidate trying to pivot to both a demeanor and a message that can sell better with a national audience that will be seeking more than the attacking style and broad policy generalities that have been more than sufficient for the primary season.Mr. Cruz, and even more so, Mr. Rubio were having none of it -- and soon enough they all were in attack mode, including Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubio defended his recent attacks on Mr. Trump by declaring: ""For the last year Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks . . . If there was ever anybody who deserved to be attacked it's Donald Trump.""Mr. Cruz said the Trump pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act rings hollow because he provided financial support to the Democrats who led the fight to pass it. Similarly, he said Mr. Trump will falter in a debate with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton because he wrote four contribution checks to her 2008 presidential campaign. He accused Mr. Trump of lacking core conservative beliefs, saying he ""has literally been on every side of every issue.""Yet none of that seemed to present problems for Mr. Trump as thorny as the one the Fox News moderators presented by challenging him to explain how he could add up the numbers in a way that would allow him to both pass the giant tax-cut plan he has proposed and make good on a promise to cut the deficit.That line of questioning opened the door for Mr. Cruz to push his own tax-cut plan, and for Mr. Kasich to talk about the virtues of actual governing experience, which Mr. Trump lacks:""You have to have the experience. You hear about Ronald Reagan rebuilding the military? I was there with him. You hear about Ronald Reagan rebuilding the economy? I was there with him.""Yet the promise of a substantive debate never really came to pass. Nor did the feeling that Messrs. Rubio and Cruz might be, as Mr. Romney suggested they might earlier in the day, working jointly somehow to stop Mr. Trump. Instead, it appeared to be each man for himself.And that included Mr. Kasich, who seemed bemused by the spectacle. It is time, he declared at one point, to ""reignite the experience of the United States of America. And let's stop fighting.""His wish wasn't granted -- until the end, when all agreed, incongruously enough, that they will support whomever becomes the Republican nominee.Credit: By Gerald F.

Election 2016: Trump Rivals Eye Convention Fight,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175561?accountid=12768,"DETROIT -- If successful, Mitt Romney's call for Republicans to vote strategically to stop Donald Trump from sewing up the party's nomination would lead to only one end: a contested party convention.That is what would likely happen if Mr. Trump's three Republican presidential rivals hold his delegate count below the 1,237 threshold needed to claim the nomination outright.If no candidate accumulates that many delegates during the primary and caucus process, the party's nominee will be chosen at the Republican National Convention, to be held in Cleveland this July.Currently, Mr. Trump has 319 delegates, to 226 for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, 110 for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and 25 for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.The New York businessman has won 10 of 15 states, and could chart an unstoppable path to the nomination if he prevails in the large states that allocate all delegates to the winner. Florida, with 99 delegates, and Ohio, with 66, are two of the biggest winner-take-all contests to come up early on the primary calendar.If Mr. Trump wins both on March 15, his path to the nomination becomes much clearer, having to win just 50% of the remaining delegates.More winner-take-all states follow: Arizona (58 delegates), Delaware (16), Montana (27), Nebraska (36), New Jersey (51) and South Dakota (29) will each hold contests between late March and June. But every other state awards its delegates proportionally.If Messrs. Kasich and Rubio win their home states and remain in the race, the trio of candidates can still stop Mr. Trump from getting to 1,237.A contested convention would put the fate of the GOP nomination in the hands of the party activists chosen to fill the delegate positions -- often a labyrinthine system that only the most sophisticated campaign machine would master. Mr. Trump's organization isn't such a machine.Take the case of the Texas delegation. Mr. Cruz won 99 of 155 delegates in his March 1 victory in his home state primary. Mr. Trump took 38 and Mr. Rubio four. During the first ballot at the convention, these delegates will be obligated to cast their votes according to election results.If no candidate accumulates 1,237 delegates on the first ballot, most delegates become free agents, able to vote for the candidate of their choice. A key to succeeding in these circumstances is for a candidate to ensure that many delegates, even if they are bound to others on the first ballot, really are his backers.""The Trump people showed up and voted in big numbers in Texas, but in terms of active party participants who will be at the state convention, that will skew toward Cruz,"" said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas GOP operative who has spent the last year training Republican activists who hope to become delegates.In Texas, representatives from more than 8,000 precincts -- most of whom were selected after the March 1 primary -- will pick the delegates to attend future county and state Senate conventions.Those delegates will then pick the people who will attend the Texas Republican Party convention in May. The attendees at the Texas GOP convention are ultimately the people who will designate the delegates to attend the national convention.In the last two weeks, as a contested convention increasingly has become the party's last hope to stop Mr. Trump, the Cruz and Rubio campaigns began building their efforts to get their supporters elected to local and state conventions nationwide. Little of that activity is visible so far, Mr. Steinhauser saidThursday.At a Monday night Cruz rally in Houston, a campaign volunteer was stationed in the lobby to talk to supporters to ""raise awareness about a brokered convention.""""If we enter a brokered convention, a strong delegate base for Sen. Cruz will be paramount in securing the nomination,"" the flyer explained.---Janet Hook contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein",4/27/16
Trump on Ford and Nabisco,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175097?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has promised to bring a businessman's savvy to the White House, so it would be nice to see evidence that the GOP frontrunner understands decisions made by . . . businesses. To judge by some of his recent remarks, not so much.Consider Nabisco and Ford, two great American corporations that, in Mr. Trump's telling, have been hijacked by bandidos from south of the border. Mexico, he said has said, ""took"" the two companies, citing the move as evidence of why ""I don't mind trade wars.""That's one way of looking at it. Another way is that both companies made rational decisions to move some of their operations to Mexico because the tax and regulatory climate in the U.S. under President Obama has become increasingly hostile to business. Before picking destructive trade fights with the world, maybe the next President could work to make America great for doing business again.Last summer, Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez, which owns Nabisco, announced that it would close nine production lines at its plant in Chicago -- the largest bakery in the world -- while investing in new technology at a facility in Salinas, Mexico. Mondelez made the decision after asking its unions for $46 million in concessions to match the annual savings it would achieve from shifting production to Mexico.The unionized workers at the Chicago plant have been threatening to strike and staged a press conference Wednesday featuring an official from the Bernie Sanders campaign. Nothing like bringing in a partner who wonders if business should exist.Operating in Chicago is particularly expensive since Illinois has among the nation's highest corporate and property taxes -- which are soaring to pay for city employee pensions -- and workers' compensation premiums. Last year Illinois lost 56 manufacturing jobs per work day while employment increased in most other Midwest states including Wisconsin (18 a day), Indiana (20), Ohio (58) and Michigan (74).As for Ford, Mr. Trump flogged the auto maker's $2.5 billion investment in two new engine and transmission plants in Mexico. Ford is also planning to build another plant in San Luis Potosi to churn out small cars and hybrids that are needed to meet federal fuel-economy standards. Ford and General Motors aim to double production in Mexico by 2018.One impetus behind Detroit's Mexico expansion is the United Auto Workers new collective-bargaining agreement, which raises hourly labor and benefit costs to $60 in 2019 -- about $10 more than foreign auto makers with plants in the U.S. -- from the current $57 for Ford and $55 for GM. The increasing wages make it less economical to produce low-margin cars.Foreign car manufacturers including BMW, Honda, Volkswagen, Kia, Nissan and Mazda have also recently announced new investments in Mexico. Besides lower labor costs, one reason they give is Mexico's free-trade agreements, which allow access to 60% of world markets. Mexico has 10 free-trade agreements with 45 countries including Japan and the European Union whereas the U.S. has only 14 deals with 20 countries.That's an argument for the U.S. to have more trade agreements, not tear up those we have. Meantime, the formula for making the U.S. economy great again remains unchanged: lower corporate and marginal tax rates, pension and entitlement reform, right to work, the repeal of ObamaCare. Mr. Trump even says he believes in some of this. Maybe he should talk about it.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Single-Payer and the U.S. Auto Industry's Good Health"" -- WSJ Mar. 14, 2016)",4/27/16
President Obama Created Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175005?accountid=12768,"President Obama doesn't get enough credit for his accomplishments. I know this because he often tells us it is so. I happen to agree that he doesn't get enough credit. No, not for slowing the rise of the oceans or healing the planet, as he immodestly claimed he would, even before taking office. He has succeeded handsomely, though, in living up to his vow to be a transformative president, like Ronald Reagan, and not an incremental one in the Bill Clinton mold. Mr. Obama has accomplished many changes -- they just aren't the ones we were waiting for.Mr. Obama has alienated allies like Israel while encouraging adversaries like Iran and Cuba. He has fostered Americans' record-breaking dependence on government programs and record-low participation in the workforce. He has expanded the power, size and expense of the federal government in unprecedented ways, all at the expense of Americans' freedom, standard of living and economic well-being.But the president truly doesn't get enough credit for creating one of the most polarizing forces in American politics today. No, not Hillary -- that is more Bill's doing. Let's be honest: There would be no Donald Trump, dominating the political scene today if it were not for President Obama.I believe that voters tend to act in open-seat presidential elections to correct for the perceived deficiencies of the incumbent. In 1980, after four years of President Carter's telling us to turn up the thermostat and wear a cardigan, while the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and the Iranians invaded the U.S. Embassy, the fed-up American people elected a cowboy to the White House who made it clear that the evil empire's days were numbered.After eight years of President Reagan's supply-side economics and broadsides against welfare queens, we got a kinder, gentler President H.W. Bush. After four years of international diplomacy without the ""vision thing,"" we got a loquacious Arkansas governor promising to invent a third way forward focused on the economy at home. After eight years of Clintonian empathy and skirt-chasing, we got a plain-spoken President George W. Bush, who promised to restore integrity to the Oval Office. After Hurricane Katrina and post-Hussein Iraq, we got the professorial President Barack Obama, who seemed to many to promise competence.After seven years of the cool, weak and endlessly nuanced ""no drama Obama,"" voters are looking for a strong leader who speaks in short, declarative sentences. Middle-class incomes are stagnant, and radical Islam is on the march across the Middle East. No wonder voters are responding to someone who promises to make America great again. You can draw a straight line between a president who dismisses domestic terrorist attacks as incidents of workplace violence and a candidate who wants to ban Muslims from entering the country.Mr. Obama likes to bemoan the increasing partisan divides across the country, as if he were merely a passive observer at best and a victim at worst. Uncharacteristically, the president is being too modest. He has created the very rancor he now rails against. Imagine how different things would be if Mr. Obama had pursued a stimulus bill that included targeted tax cuts and infrastructure spending balanced with gradual entitlement reforms -- instead of a stimulus that merely dusted off congressional Democrats' wish list of pork-barrel projects and ideological experiments.Imagine if Mr. Obama had actually worked with Republicans in an open process to bring down health-care costs -- instead of pushing through, on a partisan vote, the largest expansion of government-welfare programs in a generation. Or if he had listened to the message that voters sent in the first midterm election by putting Republicans in charge of Congress -- instead of petulantly relying on executive orders, and using an eraser and whiteout on the Constitution, to shove the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies deeper into Americans' lives.Over the past seven years America could have been transformed in an inspiring way if its education system had been opened up, if its energy policy had been liberated, if the entire approach to governing had been overhauled. President Obama chose the opposite approach, favoring a closed education system that fails millions of children and an energy policy that chains the economy to his green agenda.President Obama loves to construct straw men so he can contrast his heroic self against them. But Donald Trump needs no characterization; he is capable of being absurd on his own, no outside help required. Without President Obama, there is no Donald Trump. Mr. Trump often diagnoses the ills Mr. Obama has caused, but his prescriptions are just as often wrong. America deserves better.---Mr. Jindal is the former governor of Louisiana.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Obama Was Shrewd if He Created Mr. Trump"" -- WSJ Mar. 14, 2016)Credit: By Bobby Jindal",4/27/16
Trump's Abortion Gaffe,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776773481?accountid=12768,"Some months ago we wrote that Republicans who nominate Donald Trump for President would be diving off a cliff without knowing what's at the bottom, and Wednesday was the latest illustration. The first-time candidate showed how little he understands about the politics of abortion by suggesting that ""there has to be some kind of punishment"" if abortion were made illegal.""For the woman?"" asked progressive partisan Chris Matthews of MSNBC. Mr. Trump: ""Yeah, there has to be some form."" He added that men who impregnate women who have an abortion should not be punished.The remarks caused an uproar -- on the right and left -- when the network released them Wednesday. Not even the most fervent abortion opponent favors punishing a woman who has one. If Roe v. Wade were overturned, opponents would try to pass laws that punish abortion providers or the clinics where they take place. Mr. Trump's remarks were thus a political gift to Democrats and the left, who would like nothing better than to stereotype abortion opponents as misogynists who want to put women in jail.The Trump campaign realized the mistake and he soon reversed himself. ""If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,"" Mr. Trump said in a statement. ""The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed -- like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.""All candidates make mistakes, and we'll credit the campaign statement as Mr. Trump's genuine belief. But the gaffe is nonetheless telling because it shows how much the Republican front-runner's campaign is a daily policy adventure. As he likes to say, he's his own best adviser, and he doesn't know what he doesn't know. The result can be a refreshing sense of political candor, but as often as not he also hands his political opponents a sword.Mr. Trump's loyal GOP partisans have been willing to ignore his rhetorical mistakes and excesses, but Democrats will be merciless. So will the media if he secures the GOP nomination. His abortion blunder is doubly troubling because it will reinforce his growing unpopularity among women voters in both parties. Imagine his Wednesday remarks playing as part of a national advertising loop from June to November. His talk-radio chaperones are going to have their work cut out.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Consider Trump's Abortion Words in Their Context"" -- WSJ April 6, 2016)",4/28/16
Wisconsin Looms as Key Test For Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776773462?accountid=12768,"ROTHSCHILD, Wis. -- Wisconsin's presidential primary next Tuesday represents the biggest test yet of Donald Trump's ability to triumph over Republican state leaders united against him.Top Wisconsin GOP players, from Gov. Scott Walker to state legislators to the powerful conservative Milwaukee talk-radio hosts, have been winning pitched battles in defense of conservative ideas since Republicans took over state government in 2011. They are united against Mr. Trump in a way he hasn't seen before, even in states where he faced millions of dollars in attack ads.The anti-Trump forces have largely aligned with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who vaulted to the lead in a statewide poll released Wednesday. That has left Mr. Trump flat-footed in his first entry into Wisconsin politics. He appeared surprised during a round of radio interviews, telling Charlie Sykes in Milwaukee that he didn't know the host had vowed never to support him.If the GOP forces keep Mr. Trump from winning more than a handful of the state's 42 delegates, they would hamper his argument that he's the party's consensus choice and damage his path to the 1,237 delegates necessary to win the nomination. Three delegates will go to the winner of each of Wisconsin's eight congressional districts. First place statewide is worth another 15 delegates. Three more are unbound.With 20 states still to vote and 904 delegates to be won, Mr. Trump is 501 short of the nomination. Mr. Cruz's path to the nomination lies in keeping the New Yorker below the 1,237-delegate threshold, forcing a contested convention in July. To win outright he would otherwise have to win 86% of the remaining delegates, an unlikely feat with many remaining states awarding delegates proportionally.Even here in the vast wooded northern part of the state friendliest to his populist message, public endorsements of the billionaire businessman are as scarce as an unfrozen lake in the dead of winter. The local congressman, Sean Duffy, is a Republican who had backed Mr. Walker and then Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. He said Tuesday he doesn't know a single elected official in his district who is publicly backing Mr. Trump.""There's a number of people in my district who are quiet Trump supporters,"" said Mr. Duffy, who said he is still deciding whether to vote for Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump. ""If you just listen to the media here, there's a lot of pushback that people get for supporting Trump. There's some social pressure as well: In their own community, this elitist mentality that tells them they are stupid to support a Donald Trump candidacy.""A Marquette Law School poll released Wednesday found Mr. Cruz leading the state with 40% support in a survey of likely voters. Mr. Trump was second at 30% and Ohio Gov. John Kasich third with 21%. Recent Marquette Law polls have found Mr. Trump far more popular among Republicans in the state's rural areas in the north and west than he is in the urban and suburban counties between Milwaukee and Green Bay.On Wednesday, state Assemblyman James ""Jimmy Boy"" Edming became the first Wisconsin lawmaker to publicly back Mr. Trump. Mr. Edming said in an interview he was motivated by the lockstep opposition from local party leaders.""Now that I'm seeing that the Republicans are trying to tackle Donald Trump, the more I see on the news, the more pissed off I get,"" said Mr. Edming, who hails from the tiny village of Glen Flora, two hours northwest of Rothschild.The population here fits the Trump demographic to a T: The median age of the Seventh Congressional District is six years older than the state average, just 2.5% of the population is black or Hispanic, and the last generation has seen thousands of the state's manufacturing jobs leave the country. Mr. Trump has dubbed his supporters ""the silent majority,"" and there is broad agreement among political observers here that he will carry by a wide margin the district, a part of the state known as ""Up North.""Mary Czaja, a Republican assemblywoman from Irma who is backing Mr. Cruz, said she is surprised by some of the people who support Mr. Trump. ""There's a lot of business owners and even more blue-collar people who are tired of the same old same old in Washington,"" she said.Mr. Trump, as he has elsewhere, is relishing his battle with the state's entrenched Republicans. At a rally Tuesday in House Speaker Paul Ryan's hometown of Janesville, he mocked Mr. Ryan and condemned Mr. Walker. Then during a Tuesday night forum on CNN he disavowed a pledge to support the party's nominee he made last year at the behest of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who hails from Kenosha.""Cruz likes to pretend he's an outsider and in the meantime he gets all the establishment support, including your governor,"" Mr. Trump said in Janesville.Mr. Kasich is largely viewed as an afterthought in the state. His campaign this week pulled some of its advertising off the Wisconsin airwaves. But he did on Tuesday receive the endorsement of the state's largest newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.One sign that Cruz allies are concerned about tamping down Mr. Kasich's support came late Tuesday when a pro-Cruz super PAC announced it would spend $500,000 in the state attacking the Ohio governor.State Sen. Tom Tiffany, a Republican who represents a district that hugs the Wisconsin-Michigan border, vouched for Mr. Cruz here even though he said he expects his constituents to back Mr. Trump.Other than Mr. Edming, none of the dozen rural Wisconsin state lawmakers interviewed for this story knew of anyone elected to office in their districts who backs Mr. Trump.""There's a huge disconnect for a lot of elected Republicans, where they have to come to terms with the fact that Donald Trump is winning my district, but I'm a core Republican and I stand for these core principles that he doesn't represent,"" said Matt Batzel, the Sheboygan-based executive director of American Majority, which offers training to conservative candidates for local political offices. Mr. Batzel said he plans to vote for Mr. Cruz.But for Mr. Trump's rank-and-file supporters, opposition from elected Republicans is a feature, not a bug of his campaign. ""They are all in cahoots with each other, Democrats and Republicans,"" said Vance Neuenschwanden, a 44-year-old weed-control worker from Monroe. ""Trump isn't either, and that's what we need.""Credit: By Reid J. Epstein and Janet Hook",4/28/16
Election 2016: Clinton Ad In New York Takes Aim At Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776773370?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton on Wednesday released her first TV ad aimed at New York voters ahead of the state's primary on April 19, and it has one target: Donald Trump.Mrs. Clinton's rival for the Democratic nomination remains Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but with a large delegate lead in the Democratic presidential race, she increasingly has been shifting her focus to her potential opponent in the general election.The 30-second spot, narrated by Mrs. Clinton, doesn't mention Mr. Trump by name. But it is filled with references to his candidacy and brand.The ad invokes some of the themes from Mr. Trump's campaign, notably his call for building a wall on America's southern border and his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the U.S. Mrs. Clinton says, ""When some say we can solve America's problems by building walls, banning people based on their religion and turning against each other. . . Well, this is New York. And we know better.""With 247 delegates at stake, New York is the biggest prize left in the Democratic primary race except for California, whose primary is set for June 7. Mrs. Clinton represented the state in the Senate for eight years before signing on as President Barack Obama's secretary of state in 2009.Earlier this year, Mr. Trump said in an interview with the Hill that he would ""expand the map"" in a general election and that he would have a ""real good shot"" at winning New York, a state that typically favors Democratic presidential candidates. ""This is my place,"" the New York businessman said. ""I love New York.""Credit: By Peter Nicholas",4/28/16
Election 2016: Trump's Children Jump Into Fray --- Candidate's three eldest offspring play a visible campaign role atop business duties,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776593855?accountid=12768,"On the weekend of the Louisiana primary earlier this month, Donald Trump Jr. fished on Lake Pontchartrain, judged a charity dance-a-thon in disco attire and told a New Orleans TV station that he is the only son of a billionaire who drives a ""Caterpillar bulldozer better than a golf cart.""His sister, Ivanka, filmed a video for the campaign's Facebook page urging Florida residents to cast early ballots in the state's primary. Their brother Eric went to North Carolina before its primary, thanking volunteers at Trump headquarters before appearing at a Fayetteville rally.Republican front-runner Donald Trump's unorthodox campaign has an unusually lean staff and few big-time political figures speaking on his behalf. His three eldest children are stepping into the void, playing a more visible role recently as campaign surrogates for their father.The three have taken over running the Trump Organization, their father's real-estate company, and the campaign's surprising success has compelled them to take on added political responsibilities. They have begun heading their own events, as well as taking care of the kind of tasks that more conventional campaigns assign to senior staff members, such as rounding up support from sympathetic groups.""Dad prepared us our entire lives to run the business,"" Don Jr., 38 years old, said in a recent interview. ""But politics? We jumped in with zero experience.""That inexperience occasionally shows. Attempting to defend his father's support of waterboarding, Eric, who is 32, told Fox News that the interrogation technique ""quite frankly is no different than what happens on college campuses and frat houses every day.""A couple of weeks ago, Don Jr. telephoned into some 30 different radio shows on his father's behalf. During one interview with a Utah host, a second radio personality, who avows a ""pro-White"" philosophy on his own website, asked questions as well.When that second guest, James Edwards, said he would broadcast Don Jr.'s interview on his own show, ""The Political Cesspool,"" some commentators questioned whether Don Jr. was encouraging extremist supporters. ""I was never informed who he was or that he was in the station or on the call,"" Don Jr. said recently.Mr. Edwards, who ultimately didn't air the interview, said, ""I apologize for nothing and I retract nothing.""Ivanka Trump, 34, has preferred not to get as deep into the political fray. ""I'm not looking to opine on policy,"" she said in an interview. Besides her role at the Trump Organization, she has her own business to run, a midprice fashion and accessories line that bears her name.Nevertheless, Ms. Trump has appeared regularly with her father on the trail, at times working the rope line and posing for selfies with Mr. Trump's supporters. She just gave birth, and Mr. Trump repeatedly mentioned her pregnancy and impending due date during campaign events.The Trump siblings say they hold a 7 a.m. breakfast every Monday to map out the week's priorities for the real-estate company. Together they handle deals and development connected to the many projects in the pipeline, but each takes lead responsibility for certain properties.Don Jr., for example, runs construction and operation of the company's Vancouver residential and hotel tower. Ivanka spearheaded the renovation of the Trump National Doral Miami hotel and golf resort. Eric is overseeing the renovation of the Turnberry Golf Resort on the Scotland coast.The three are children from the first of Mr. Trump's three marriages, to Ivana Trump. The candidate's two younger children, Tiffany, 22, a college student, and 10-year-old Barron, are rarely on the campaign trail.In an interview, Mr. Trump said that looking back, ""I was a better father than a husband.""All three are married. Donald Trump Jr. has five children. Ivanka now has three. Eric Trump, who has none, is logging the most miles with his father on his private jet.A recent political stunt helped a Trump business run by Eric. At a news conference after winning primaries on March 8, Mr. Trump displayed Trump water, wine and steaks in response to former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's jab that these ventures had failed. The next day, Eric heard from Trump Winery that it had receiveda record 1,000 orders for wine, he said.The day before the Nevada caucuses, with Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz scheduled to speak in Elko, Showtime's weekly show about the campaign, ""The Circus,"" was there to cover both candidates. The Trump campaign dispatched Don Jr. to make his first solo speaking appearance. Dressed in jeans and navy blazer, he fielded questions for 45 minutes before a crowd of 300.Mark McKinnon, a longtime GOP strategist who co-created of ""The Circus,"" was watching. ""Don Jr. is a naturally gifted politician,"" he remarked.In New York, the three siblings have offices side-by-side on the 25th floor of Trump Tower. All were in town one day recently reviewing real-estate projects under construction.One of them, the redevelopment of the Old Post Office building in Washington into the Trump International Hotel, sits on Pennsylvania Avenue, where the Inauguration Day parade will pass in January.Ms. Trump said the hotel already is being deluged with room requests for the inaugural week, even though it isn't yet open. With her father's campaign in mind, she joked: ""We may be holding back a few rooms.""Credit: By Monica Langley",4/28/16
Election 2016: Clinton Digs In as Trump Moves On,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776257418?accountid=12768,"Jessica Flannery spent the first half of March in Democrat Hillary Clinton's Des Moines campaign office with three dozen other volunteers, calling the front-runner's supporters in Iowa to ensure they showed up at county conventions and were elected delegates to the national party gathering in July.Republican front-runner Donald Trump's campaign, meanwhile, sent an email to local Republicans just before the statewide county convention inviting them to sign up to be a delegate for him. The campaign followed up a few days later with an apology, telling email recipients they weren't eligible to be delegates unless they'd already enrolled as one at local precincts.""It did not evidence a robust organization,"" said Matt Strawn, a former Iowa GOP chairman who received one of the emails. Mr. Trump also has stopped paying his top two Iowa operatives, whose contracts expired last month -- weeks after the state's first-in-the-nation caucuses were held.As Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump aim to clinch their parties' nominations, the former secretary of state is poised to start the general-election campaign with a far more sophisticated operation in key swing states than the businessman.""It unequivocally is helpful for a campaign that spent a year-plus working in Iowa to keep some people in play,"" said David Oman, a former Iowa state GOP co-chairman and senior political adviser to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who quit the race last month. ""It would be a mistake to let people go. . .and then have to put the team back together again to marshal a general-election campaign.""Mr. Trump has largely eschewed implementing a traditional ground game, instead relying on large rallies and his star power to turn out voters. As a consequence, strategists in Iowa and New Hampshire say there's little left of his already-sparse operations in the states.Mr. Trump's Iowa state director, Chuck Laudner, is no longer working for the campaign, the longtime Iowa operative confirmed. He was paid $21,000 at the end of February, down from nearly $35,000 for the month before the Iowa caucuses.Deputy state director Ryan Keller also said his contract with the campaign had ended, and said he hadn't ""put that much thought"" into whether he would rejoin for the general election. The campaign's primary remaining operative in the state is Tana Goertz, a former contestant on Mr. Trump's reality TV show, ""The Apprentice.""The Trump campaign didn't return a request for comment.After Mr. Trump placed second in Iowa, he criticized his own campaign's operations there. ""I think we could have used a better ground game, a term I wasn't even familiar with,"" he told MSNBC in the days after the Iowa caucuses. ""I would've funded a better ground game, but people told me my ground game was fine.""In New Hampshire, where Mr. Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski previously served as state director for a pro-free market group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, Mr. Trump ran a similarly thin operation. ""Mr. Trump never really had any infrastructure to begin with,"" said Jamie Burnett, a Republican strategist who worked on Mitt Romney's 2008 campaign. ""When he left town, they packed up the three-ring circus and they sent the public-relations campaign to another state.""Mr. Burnett, who supported Mr. Bush before he left the GOP race, said that if Mr. Trump becomes the nominee, he will be ""starting from scratch"" in New Hampshire. ""They're going to have to hope that a big, large-scale PR campaign can beat someone like Clinton, and I just don't think it can,"" he said.Mr. Trump's unorthodox operation has proven to be mostly successful. He has won the majority of states and has a lead of nearly 300 delegates over Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Yet GOP strategists say a general-election terrain -- in which he would face a single opponent -- could offer a tougher test of his campaign strategy.Mrs. Clinton's operation, which had 26 offices in Iowa in the lead-up to the state's Feb. 1 caucuses, has left one open, where Ms. Flannery, an organizing director for Naral Pro-Choice, manned six phone banks this month.Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said this month that building a volunteer base in primary states is an ""investment for the general election."" She pointed to the importance of the databases in states that are battlegrounds in the general election. ""Those are useful audiences that you want to reach repeatedly,"" she said.---Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",4/28/16
"Election 2016: Cruz, Trump Trade Blame for Latest Personal Attacks",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778087189?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on Sunday that Donald Trump resorted to a personal attack on Mr. Cruz's wife to distract from his own shortcomings on national security and foreign-policy matters.""His lack of ability and readiness to protect this country was evident, so Donald did what he always does, he tried to find a way to change the subject,"" Mr. Cruz said on Fox News Sunday.""Donald is out of his depth, he doesn't understand these issues. . . He has no answers for how to keep America safe from radical Islamic terrorism so instead, he attacks my wife, he attacks my family, he goes to garbage, and sleaze and lies.""The battle between Mr. Trump, the GOP front-runner, and Mr. Cruz, who is second in the race for convention delegates, has taken on an increasingly nasty, personal character in recent weeks.Ahead of the March 22 Utah caucuses, an anti-Trump super PAC used a racy photograph of Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, shot during her career as a model, to mock her. In response, Mr. Trump last week threatened to ""spill the beans"" on Mr. Cruz's wife, Heidi, and retweeted a photo that showed Mrs. Trump alongside an unflattering picture of Mrs. Cruz.On Friday, Mr. Cruz accused Mr. Trump of planting a false story in the National Enquirer alleging Mr. Cruz had carried on extramarital affairs. On Sunday, Mr. Cruz said the National Enquirer's chief executive was a close friend of Mr. Trump's, and noted that the paper had endorsed the New York businessman. Mr. Trump denied having any connection to the story.Mr. Trump blamed Mr. Cruz for starting the spat. ""They make me like the bad guy here.I'm just responding to what he does,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday. ""He's the one that started it. He knew about the picture.""Mr. Cruz said Sunday he had no knowledge of the ad and didn't know the group responsible for it. He said the race had taken its current personal turn after Mr. Trump questioned whether America should maintain its position within NATO, which Mr. Cruz described as a ""catastrophically foolish proposition"" that would ""hand a massive victory"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Islamic State militants.Credit: By Aruna Viswanatha",4/28/16
Election 2016: Suburban Weakness Is a Warning Sign for Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776145203?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has dominated the Republican primaries despite a weakness that could prove damaging in a general election: He is losing many of the populous suburbs where the battle for the White House is often won and lost.Mr. Trump carried the swing state of Virginia in the GOP primary, for example, but he lost the voter-rich suburbs of Washington, D.C., which tend to decide general elections in the state.In North Carolina, another general-election battleground, Mr. Trump lost three of the four largest counties, including those around Raleigh and Greensboro. In Iowa, he lost the county that includes Des Moines and the next three most populous counties. In Ohio, he lost the voter-heavy areas around Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Akron.If the suburban trend holds with Mr. Trump as the GOP nominee, it would underscore how vital it is for him to fulfill his pledge to redraw the traditional political map by attracting new and different Republican voters elsewhere. Urban areas account for about 44% of the vote in general elections, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows, split evenly between cities and the dense, diverse suburbs around them.Most Republicans are likely to stick with the party in November, even if they backed Mr. Trump's primary-election rivals. At the same time, nonpartisan analysts say that Mr. Trump may have driven away a meaningful number of Republicans with an antiestablishment, anti-immigration message that has energized working-class voters but drawn skepticism in thesuburbs, where voters tend to have higher incomes and higher levels of education.""Trump is weaker where Republicans are usually strong -- in the big, growing, cosmopolitan,suburbancounties, where elections are increasingly determined,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.Barry Bennett, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said urban suburbs, particularly around state capitals, are home to ""establishment"" Republicans who aren't Mr. Trump's prime audience.""They're looking for a traditional Republican candidate. . . . That's not our base vote right now,"" he said. ""If you're looking at middle-,upper-income families in suburbia, our message has really caught a hold of people who are struggling more than that.""Mr. Bennett said Mr. Trump is redefining the party's appeal and drawing in new voters in a way that would offset any weakness in the suburbs. ""Turnout is through the roof,"" he said.In the 2012 presidential race, Mitt Romney won the large, suburban counties in Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa and many other swing states in the primaries but struggled to carry them in the general election. He reclaimed only North Carolina and Indiana for the GOP after the party lost both four years earlier.Mr. Trump's challenge ""is to hold on and increase the working-class white vote and at the same time re-establish the appeal with traditional suburban voters,"" said Mr. Rothenberg.Mr. Trump has done well in the urban suburbs in some primaries, carrying such communities in Florida, Michigan and other states. But his weakness among suburban voters has appeared even in some states he swept with big margins, such as Georgia and Tennessee. While those states aren't likely to slip from Republican hands in November, they could signal problems in the urban suburbs of other states.In Wisconsin, home of the next big Republican primary, on April 5, Mr. Trump's profile is upside-down compared with those of successful Republicans there, such as Gov. Scott Walker, polling shows.Usually, Republicans win with big vote margins from three populous counties surrounding the state's major urban center, Milwaukee. But Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, said Mr. Trump is viewed far more unfavorably among Republicans in those three GOP-stronghold counties than he is in the rest of the state.When Mr. Franklin merged the results of the past four Marquette polls dating to September, he found that Mr. Trump was viewed unfavorably by 64% of Republicans in the three suburban counties around Milwaukee, compared with 32% who held negative views of Mr. Trump in other parts of the state. One quarter of Republicans held favorable views of Mr. Trump in those three counties, compared with 53% elsewhere.If Mr. Trump struggles to win suburban voters, the problem will appear in places such as Loudoun County in northern Virginia.As Loudoun's population more than doubled over the past 15 years to 375,000, its Hispanic population more than quadrupled to about 50,000. Indian-Americans are also plentiful. Now Virginia's fourth-largest county, Loudoun has shed its rural profile and features gourmet cupcake shops and pet spas, making it an unlikely fit for Mr. Trump's blue-collar message.In the March 1 primary, Loudoun County, like much of northern Virginia, voted for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Mr. Trump won about 28% there, compared with about 35% statewide.""Trump's challenge is he has to win suburban mothers, even Republican mothers,"" said Ron Meyer, a county supervisor who supported Mr. Rubio.Mr. Trump's potential supporters in the county include Robert Bocek, a Microsoft employee. ""I think Trump brings a lot to the table in terms of his business sense, but there is also an arrogance, a bullheadedness,"" Mr. Bocek said.A Journal analysis of 2012 election results and 2016 polls illustrates the situation. It grouped the nation's counties into seven categories as defined by the American Communities Project, a demography research project. The categories include big cities, heavily religious communities, exurbs and rural areas.In the urban suburbs, typified by the counties outside Philadelphia, Chicago and Washington, D.C., President Barack Obama drew 57% support in 2012, to 41% for Mr. Romney.When results of a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from March were tabulated by county type, Mrs. Clinton drew 61% support in urban suburbs in a test match-up against Mr. Trump, who won 29%.Credit: By Dante Chinni and Aaron Zitner",4/28/16
Where Trump Can Still Get a Loan,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774469142?accountid=12768,"One of Donald Trump's closest allies on Wall Street is a now-struggling German bank.While many big banks have shunned him, Deutsche Bank AG has been a steadfast financial backer of the Republican presidential candidate's business interests. Since 1998, the bank has led or participated in loans of at least $2.5 billion to companies affiliated with Mr. Trump, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of public records and people familiar with the matter. That doesn't include at least an additional $1 billion in loan commitments that Deutsche Bank made to Trump-affiliated entities.The long-standing connection makes Deutsche Bank, which has a large U.S. operation and has been grappling with reputational problems and a diving stock price, the financial institution with probably the strongest ties to the controversial New York businessman.But the relations at times have been rocky. Deutsche Bank's giant investment-banking unit stopped working with Mr. Trump after an acrimonious legal spat, even as another arm of the company continued to lend him money.Other Wall Street banks, after doing extensive business with Mr. Trump in the 1980s and 1990s, pulled back in part because of frustration with his business practices but also because he moved away from real-estate projects that required financing, according to bank officials. Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are among the banks that don't currently work with him.At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., bankers ""know better than to pitch"" a Trump-related deal, said a former Goldman executive. Goldman officials say there is little overlap between the bank's core investment-banking group and Mr. Trump's businesses.The lukewarm relations with banks is one reason Mr. Trump's White House bid hasn't received much financial support from Wall Street, bankers and fund managers say. The securities-and-investment industry, which includes Wall Street firms, has donated roughly $19 million toward the campaign of Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Trump, who is largely self-funded, has received $17,255.Ivanka Trump, who works with her father at Trump Organization LLC, which holds the family's real-estate and other business interests, denied that Wall Street banks are wary of doing business with the family. ""The biggest banking institutions are constantly soliciting us,"" Ms. Trump said in an interview. ""But we don't need a lot of financing because we have a great balance sheet and a tremendous amount of cash.""Deutsche Bank's relationship with Mr. Trump dates to the 1990s. The bank, eager to expand in the U.S. via commercial-real-estate lending, set out to woo big New York developers such as Mr. Trump and Harry Macklowe.One of the bank's first loans to Mr. Trump, in 1998, was $125 million to renovate the office building at 40 Wall Street. More deals soon followed, with the bank agreeing over the next few years to lend or help underwrite bonds worth a total of more than $1.3 billion for Trump entities.By 2005, Deutsche Bank had emerged as one of Mr. Trump's leading bankers. That year, the German bank and others lent a Trump entity $640 million to build the 92-story Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. Deutsche Bank officials badly wanted the deal because it came with a $12.5 million fee attached, said a person familiar with the matter.Mr. Trump charmed the bankers, flying them on his Boeing 727 jet, according to people who traveled with him.But when the housing bubble burst, the relationship frayed. In 2008, Mr. Trump failed to pay $334 million he owed on the Chicago loan because of lackluster sales of the building's units. He then sued Deutsche Bank, arguing the economic crisis constituted a ""force majeure"" -- an unforeseen event such as war or natural disaster -- that should excuse repayment until conditions improve.His lawyers were inspired to invoke the clause after hearing former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan describe the crisis as a ""once-in-a-century credit tsunami,"" according to a person who worked on the case for Mr. Trump.The court rejected Mr. Trump's arguments but the suit forced Deutsche Bank to the negotiating table. The two sides agreed to settle their suits out of court in 2009. The following year, they extended the original loan by five years. It was paid off in 2012 -- with the help of a loan from the German firm's private bank.While Deutsche Bank didn't lose money on the deal, the fracas soured its investment bankers on working with Mr. Trump. ""He was persona non grata after that,"" said a banker who worked on the deal.Credit: By Anupreeta Das",4/28/16
Trump and the Protesters,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772649428?accountid=12768,"Democracies are inevitably raucous, but they are often more fragile than their citizens believe. Americans, and especially President Obama and the presidential candidates, should take that lesson to heart amid the protests and outbursts of violence of the past week.With his unrestrained rhetoric about Mexicans, Muslims and even his fellow Republicans, Donald Trump has become a polarizing political figure of the kind the U.S. hasn't seen in many years. It's no surprise, then, that Mr. Trump has inspired a political counter-reaction.His rallies are now being systematically targeted by the organized left, as MoveOn.org has admitted. Like the university left these days, progressive activists have no tolerance for dissent and want to shut down conservative speech. The provocateurs who infiltrated the Chicago venue for Mr. Trump's rally on Friday claimed victory when Mr. Trump prudently decided to cancel rather than risk an even uglier confrontation.Some of these activists want to be arrested and some are not above violence. The man who bull-rushed the stage at Mr. Trump's event on Saturday may have intended to do genuine harm. It's worth recalling that Black Lives Matter activists also shut down a Bernie Sanders event last year. Hillary Clinton and President Obama would have more credibility criticizing Mr. Trump if they also condemned the antispeech left.What's as disturbing, however, is Mr. Trump's apparent instinct to respond to the protesters in kind. This includes his denunciations of free political speech. A few weeks ago he said he would rewrite the libel laws to sue the press to muzzle his critics. He has threatened this newspaper with a defamation suit merely because we noted his evident lack of knowledge about the Pacific trade deal. In Kansas City on Saturday he assailed ""lying, thieving reporters.""Worse, his reckless language can seem to condone violence from his supporters. Last month he responded to one protester by saying that ""the guards are very gentle with him. He's walking out, like, big high-fives, smiling, laughing."" Then he added, to loud cheers, ""I'd like to punch him in the face, I tell ya.""Like the left-wing professor at the University of Missouri who called last year for ""muscle"" to evict conservatives, Mr. Trump said in Kansas City he would have responded to a protester ""boom, boom, boom"" as he made a fist. He also said his campaign may pay the legal fees of one of his supporters who sucker-punched a protester in the face as he was being led out of a rally this week.Mr. Trump has shown no desire to tone any of this down, and perhaps he figures it will mobilize supporters to vote in Tuesday's important primaries. He may be right in that short-term political calculation, but the cost could be very high if he wins the nomination. Americans want a President they can respect, not one who is a constant source of turmoil.Readers of a certain age will remember 1968, the worst election year in recent American history before this one, with its often violent protests. Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated. The protests this year have been mild by comparison, at least so far. But the first obligation of political leadership is maintaining civil order, and that goes in particular for those who aspire to be President.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Trump and Lincoln's Views Of the 'Others' in Society"" -- WSJ March 21, 2016)(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Remember Harry Truman's Threatening Note"" -- WSJ Apr. 2, 2016)",4/28/16
A Trade Tutorial for Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1772037395?accountid=12768,"With the presidential frontrunners of both parties flogging made-in-America populism, it's no surprise that voters are turning against free trade. So allow us to add some facts to this so far data-free debate, and we're available to give Donald Trump a tutorial upon request.The real-estate developer recently added Japan to his most-wanted list of job killers, which includes China and Mexico. ""We have a trade deficit with Japan of over $100 billion a year,"" he said during his post-primary press conference in Florida on Tuesday. ""They're killing us. You know what we sell to Japan? Practically nothing.""Is $116 billion worth of annual goods and services exports to Japan practically nothing? Japan is the fourth largest U.S. export market in goods after Canada, Mexico and China. In 2013 the top U.S. exports to Japan were agricultural products ($12.1 billion), machinery ($10.7 billion), medical devices ($8 billion) and aircraft ($7.1 billion).According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the overall U.S. trade deficit in goods with Japan was $68 billion last year. Vehicles accounted for much of the deficit, but that's primarily because Japanese car makers can produce superior small cars at a lower cost than can U.S. manufacturers. Federal fuel economy standards harm American automakers more than trade does.Notably, the U.S. enjoys large comparative advantages in high-value manufacturing and agriculture. In 2012, according to the White House trade rep, the U.S. ran a $20 billion trade surplus with Japan in private commercial services such as consulting, legal services and information technology.Nonetheless, Mr. Trump on Tuesday rapped Japan for ""playing around with the yen,"" which he claimed has undercut U.S. companies. ""Caterpillar is being hurt very badly by Komatsu"" of Japan, he said.The yen has fallen by about 25% to the dollar since 2012 when it was widely thought to be overvalued, and this has benefited Japanese exporters. But the Bank of Japan's monetary interventions have been aimed at stimulating domestic demand and inflation, not boosting exports. In any case, Caterpillar's recent struggles are mainly due to plunging commodity prices that have hurt global sales for its mining equipment amid slowing demand from China.By the way, Komatsu employs thousands of workers at nine U.S. locations, which include Rolling Meadows and Peoria, Illinois. Notwithstanding the weakening yen, Japanese auto makers have also increased production in the U.S., in part to avoid import duties, hedge foreign exchange risks and reduce shipping costs. More than three-quarters of Nissans sold in the U.S. are produced domestically.The best way to boost American exports is to remove trade barriers with new trade agreements. U.S. farm producers would particularly benefit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Japan and 10 other countries. Japanese tariffs on beef would fall to 9% in the 16th year of the deal from 38.5% while the 20% tariff on ground pork would be eliminated in six years. Japan's 21.3% levy on poultry and eggs would be abolished in six to 13 years.Mr. Trump claims that as President he would make smarter and ""fairer"" trade deals. He could help persuade voters by showing that he knows more than nothing about foreign trade.",4/28/16
The Trump-Sanders China Syndrome,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776590872?accountid=12768,"Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, with a phalanx of lawmakers behind them, continue to bash China as a ""currency manipulator."" Both men claim that Beijing is engaged in a permanent strategy to keep the yuan weak and prop up its trade surplus. But the reality was never that simple, and the charge is ludicrous at present.Beijing began pegging its currency to the U.S. dollar over two decades ago, as part of its plan to integrate the Chinese economy into a global marketplace in which transactions were overwhelmingly priced in dollars. It stuck by this strategy even during the height of the Asian financial crisis, in 1998, when much of the world was expecting it to devalue. This earned it great praise from the U.S. government. ""China, by maintaining its exchange rate policy,"" pronounced President Clinton's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, ""has been an important island of stability in a turbulent region.""But once market pressures reversed, and capital began flowing into China, U.S. lawmakers suddenly decided that currency stability was bad: They wanted the yuan to rise, while China continued to keep it fixed. In a 2006 op-ed for this newspaper, Sens. Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham declared that ""one of the fundamental tenets of free trade is that currencies should float."" Such a tenet, remarkably, was unknown to either Adam Smith or John Maynard Keynes, neither of whom ever supported any such thing.Fast forward to 2016, and capital is now flowing out of China at a prodigious rate. In an effort to slow the resulting fall in its currency, China's central bank has been selling vast amounts of dollars and buying up yuan. At $3.2 trillion, China's reserves still seem enormous. But they are down $790 billion from their 2014 peak, and $325 billion in the past four months.At this pace of decline, China's reserves will fall to $2.8 trillion in July. To put this in perspective, China, using the International Monetary Fund's framework for reserve-adequacy measurement, needs to hold between $2.8 trillion and $4.2 trillion in reserves to safeguard against a balance-of-payments crisis. Once reserves fall below an adequate precautionary level, China is at risk of being unable to pay for essential imports or its dollar debts. The IMF estimate could be overly cautious, given China's relatively low level of external debt, but it could also be too sanguine in that some significant portion of China's reserves, estimated to be around a third, is believed to be tied up in nonliquid assets -- and unavailable in a crisis. These include China's capital commitment to the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.So what can China do to stanch the rapid decline in reserves?The country has for years been pursuing what has been called the ""Impossible Trinity"": controlling interest and exchange rates while leaving the capital account significantly open. Chinese residents are permitted to send up to $50,000 overseas annually and this is enough to allow trillions in outflows. China could impose tighter capital controls to prevent this, as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda recently urged it to do. This would allow it to operate safely with fewer reserves. The adequate level of precautionary reserves falls to between $1.7 trillion and $2.6 trillion when adjusted for capital controls. But this would put a halt to China's plans to transform the yuan into a major reserve currency -- something it will be reluctant to do.China could also raise interest rates, which might encourage capital inflows and discourage outflows, but this would hurt growth in an already sinking economy.Finally, China could let the exchange rate fall significantly, but this would increase the debt burden on Chinese companies. Outstanding dollar credit to Chinese nonfinancial companies is estimated to be around $1 trillion. Too great a fall in the yuan, coupled with slowing economic growth, could precipitate a corporate solvency crisis.That China has no good options, and only a choice among painful ones, reflects the underlying structural problem in the Chinese economy -- one that will take many years to fix. The economy was tooled to support grossly overoptimistic expectations of foreign demand for Chinese exports. Retooling it to encourage domestic demand will require time and a willingness by the Chinese government to allow businesses to die so that more promising ones may live.It also shows that American charges that China's currency was massively undervalued were based on the flawed assumption that capital would want, indefinitely, only to get into China and not out. It's a sure bet no one in Washington will be calling for China to float its currency again anytime soon.---Mr. Steil is director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of ""The Battle of Bretton Woods"" (Princeton University Press, 2013).

Trump Is Obama Squared,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776257352?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is Barack Obama squared. Not as a matter of rhetorical style, where the president is glib and grammatical, while the developer is rambling and coarse. Not as a matter of economic instincts, where Mr. Obama is a social democrat while Mr. Trump is a mercantilist.And not as a matter of temperament. Mr. Obama is aloof and calculated. Mr. Trump loves to get in your face.But leave smaller differences aside. The president and The Donald are two epic narcissists who see themselves as singularly suited to redeem an America that is not only imperfect but fundamentally broken. Both men revel in their disdain for the political system and the rules governing it. Both men see themselves not as politicians but as movement leaders. Both are prone to telling fairy tales about their lives and careers.And both believe they are better than everyone else.""I think I'm a better speech writer than my speech writers,"" Mr. Obama told an aide in 2008. ""I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors. And I'll tell you right now that I'm . . . a better political director than my director."" Compare that to Mr. Trump earlier this month, when asked on MSNBC who he turns to for foreign policy advice. ""My primary consultant is myself.""Historians may mark the early 21st century as the moment when Americans stopped seeking probity or at least predictability in their leaders and started shopping for ecstasy and transformation; a politics beyond words. Republicans mocked the grandiosity of Mr. Obama's first run for the presidency -- the Doric columns; the pledge to make the seas recede -- but is that so different from the pompous iconography of the Trump jet or his manifestly absurd promises to get foreign countries to pay for his political boondoggles?More to the point, Mr. Obama was a cult-of-personality candidate. His admirers projected on him whatever they wanted to see: passionate liberal; post-ideological pragmatist; philosopher king; cool cat. Politically, he was the equivalent of a non-falsifiable hypothesis. No evidence could disprove his rightness.Mr. Trump inspires similar fancies among his supporters. Either he's the Great Negotiator who will know how to bargain with Congress and cut better trade and security deals with the Saudis, Chinese, Europeans and so on. Or he's the immovable man of principle who will remain unbowed when, for instance, troubles mount with his mass deportation of los ilegales.Both interpretations can't be true. But it's in the nature of cult personalities that followers rarely ask hard questions because they are seeking leaders who square circles.Non-American readers might also note the ways in which, on foreign policy, Mr. Trump is a magnification of Mr. Obama, rather than his opposite number. The president caused some consternation overseas when he complained, in a recent lengthy interview with the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, that too many U.S. allies are ""free riders"" mooching off American security guarantees. ""We don't always have to be the ones who are up front,"" the president explained. Leading from behind ""was part of the anti-free rider campaign.""Now take Mr. Trump. NATO, he told the New York Times last week, is ""unfair"" to the U.S., which pays ""a disproportionate share"" of the defense burden. The U.S.-Japan defense treaty is ""not a fair deal."" Across the world, the U.S. is being ""systematically ripped off."" On Ukraine, ""I would agree with"" the president that the country belongs in Russia's sphere of influence. If Europeans won't take the lead, Mr. Trump wonders, why should the U.S.?Both men also share the conviction that the U.S. can't afford much of a foreign policy anymore. Mr. Obama often faults the high cost of the war in Iraq for ""constraining our ability to nation-build here at home."" Mr. Trump complains that ""we're defending the world"" despite a national debt nearing $21 trillion.One man wants to shrink America's role in the world for the sake of a bigger state; the other man for the sake of shrinking the debt. In either case, the prescription is to put America in retreat. In neither case do they want to address the real driver of the U.S.'s long-term fiscal problems, which are entitlements and welfare (59% of the federal budget), not defense and international security (16%).Which brings us to the most important way in which Mr. Trump is another version of the president: They both bend reality to suit their conveniences, and their conceits.In Mr. Obama's universe, terrorism is a nuisance, climate change is an apocalypse, and economic growth is an inequality problem. In Mr. Trump's, immigrants are invaders, trade is theft and allies are millstones. For each species of rubbish there's a sizable political constituency. Maybe it will be large enough to launch Mr. Trump to the White House.There's a tendency among pundits to offer high-toned explanations for why Mr. Trump has risen this far, despite political expectations and ordinary good sense. Many of those pundits performed similarly opportunistic services when Mr. Obama's star was rising. We repeat our mistakes when we think we're doing the opposite.---Write bstephens@wsj.com.Credit: By Bret Stephens",4/29/16
Paul Ryan and the Trump Squeeze Play,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1775773529?accountid=12768,"This has been a bizarre election year, and it's getting more so: An odd crossfire from the left and right is attacking Paul Ryan for not attacking Donald Trump more vigorously and even failing to lead a third-party challenge. As if the Trump insurgency hasn't done enough damage, they're volunteering the Speaker to risk the House majority too.Mr. Ryan has already spoken up three times about Mr. Trump's rhetorical excesses, and this week he offered a broader defense of a better politics. He spoke of his hope for a more ""confident America"" where ""we don't shut people down. If someone has a bad idea, we tell them why our idea is better. We don't insult them into agreeing with us. We try to persuade them. . . . We shouldn't accept ugliness as the norm. We should demand better from ourselves and one another.""---This isn't enough for Mr. Ryan's critics, and readers should understand their self-serving motives. For progressives, the goal is to use Mr. Trump as a wedge to produce even wider GOP divisions and drive a stake in Mr. Ryan's politics of growth and upward mobility.Democrats view Mr. Trump as the easiest nominee to defeat, and they will then cheer on a potential stop-Trump third party that fractures the GOP coalition even further and throws the Electoral College to Hillary Clinton in a landslide. Beyond this election year, they see Mr. Ryan as the more serious long-term policy threat and want to take him down too.On the other side are a cast of conservative intellectuals who don't like Mr. Ryan because he continues to believe in the Ronald Reagan-Jack Kemp vision of a tax-reforming, free-market GOP that focuses on economic growth. They think the GOP needs a policy mix to address income inequality and promote redistribution -- albeit to the middle class -- rather than aiming for faster growth.They'd love to volunteer Mr. Ryan for a kamikaze political mission that leaves someone else to pick up the rubble in 2020. This year most of this crowd wanted Marco Rubio, who adopted many of their ideas, but perhaps you don't recall how ""wage enhancement"" and a new $2,500 tax credit for children stirred the masses.Mr. Ryan is doing fine on his own and he can afford to ignore this left-right advice. The Speaker hasn't hesitated to condemn Mr. Trump's bad ideas on the merits as they arise, including his Muslim travel ban. But Mr. Ryan also has other obligations, not least protecting the GOP from larger damage this election year.Start with his role as chairman of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which could be contested for the first time in decades. He's officially neutral, and he'll undermine his credibility and impartiality if he joins the never-Trump clique -- especially when the Trump campaign is already warning of riots and building a stabbed-in-the-back narrative if their man doesn't get the nomination.If Mr. Trump is the nominee, then Mr. Ryan must defend his party's best interests. This means above all protecting the House majority that polls show a Trump nomination could imperil. If Mrs. Clinton is elected President and Chuck Schumer runs the Senate, a GOP House is the only defense against a policy repeat of 2009-2010. Mr. Ryan can't simply write off the GOP nominee and the millions of votes Mr. Trump has won.The House GOP's role will also be crucial if Mr. Trump wins in November. The businessman has no fixed principles we can detect, and a GOP Congress would have to steer him away from his worst instincts on trade, immigration and isolationism.Mr. Ryan has shown he can elevate the GOP's vision and ambitions before. He once was a backbencher pushing reform budgets into the void of the late Tom-DeLay-George W. Bush era. He has gone on to do more than any other Republican during the Obama Presidency to promote constructive alternatives, especially on health care. Since 2012 Mitt Romney's running mate has tried to build a bipartisan consensus to solve the failures of U.S. antipoverty programs. This year he's convened an ""agenda project"" to detail what the GOP would try to achieve in 2017.The irony is that many of the same pundits now demanding that Mr. Ryan become their sword against Mr. Trump also praised the New Yorker last summer for his challenge to GOP orthodoxy. These former Trump apologists claimed the GOP should absorb his rage against the status quo. Instead of income-tax rate cuts, get behind family-friendly tax credits. Make peace with the entitlement state. Restrict trade and immigration allegedly to lift blue-collar wages. Alas for these would-be king-makers, Mr. Trump doesn't take much advice.The Trump insurgency has a long way to play out, and someone else could still win the GOP nomination. But whatever happens, Mr. Ryan and his political allies will have to limit the policy and political damage. That means preserving a vision of the GOP as a pro-growth, reform party that is inclusive and meets the challenges of the current era. Mr. Ryan knows how to do that better than his critics do.",4/29/16

Trump Gets Badgered; A transcript of the weekend's program on FOX News Channel.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777832564?accountid=12768,"Paul Gigot: This week on ""The Journal Editorial Report,"" all eyes on Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday's pivotal primary. Could the Badger State be a major obstacle on Donald Trump's path to the nomination? Plus, last weekend's three-state sweep puts the wind back in Bernie Sanders's sail. So could Democrats be facing some convention chaos of their own? And conservatives feeling the loss of Justice Antonin Scalia as a divided Supreme Court hands big labor a victory. But first, these headlines.***Gigot: Welcome to ""The Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.All eyes on Wisconsin this weekend, where Donald Trump's two remaining rivals are hoping to throw up a roadblock on his path to the Republican nomination. A new FOX Business poll is the second of this week showing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with a 10-point lead in the Badger State. So would a loss there be enough to stop Trump's momentum, and could it deny him the 1,237 delegates he needs going into the GOP convention in July?Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor Dan Henninger, and columnists Kim Strassel and Jason Riley.Kim, what is going on in Wisconsin? Why is that proving to be such a stumbling block for Donald Trump?Strassel: Donald Trump has got a lot of problems there. One, he's up against a Republican electorate in Wisconsin that's been through a lot of battles over the last few years over Scott Walker's big government reform, Senate recalls, gubernatorial recalls. These people are very savvy. They're very energetic and informed. They are very into conservative principles. And they are not quite sure that they are taking to Donald Trump.Gigot: Well, is it because they are not sure Donald Trump is a conservative? The conservative talk show hosts there, in contrast to some of the national radio talk show hosts, who have been in Trump's camp--in Wisconsin, these are real conservatives who are saying, ""Look, we are not sure if Trump is one of us.""Strassel: That's right. And they are very influential in that state. It's another aspect of Wisconsin. There's three or four of these radio talk show hosts, a lot of conservatives get most of their news from them, and most of them have been in the Never Trump movement from the start. So there is a lot of pent-up hostility for Donald Trump in that state.Gigot: Not a good week, Jason, for Donald Trump, generally and nationally. That also may be part of this. You had his abortion misstep where he said initially, in response to Chris Matthews, that the women should be punished if abortion were illegal, and then he took that back. That was not just liberals criticizing, but people on the right of the abortion issue.Riley: It fits the pattern--the comments on the women in the past, and now this. People don't like to see that. It is not just that issue, though. He has done these town halls where he's shown he's out of his depth talking about issues like NATO, nuclear proliferation. Donald Trump does not seem to have a decent grasp of the issues, let alone the type of grasp of issues that a conservatives electorate would like their candidate to have.Gigot: Yeah. There a question of performance, Dan. Coming out of Super Tuesday, it looked like he was in a position to consolidate his support and grow it. He gave a speech at AIPAC in Washington where he spoke from a text, where he focused on the substance of the issue. Yet that kind of dwindled away with these off-the-cuff remarks that raised questions about whether he could sustain a campaign against Hillary Clinton. I don't care how much you support Donald Trump, there has to be a doubt about performance.Henninger: Right. There's a couple of things going on here in Wisconsin. First, it is the first post-Marco Rubio primary, in which you've only got the three people running. The question was always: Where are Rubio's voters going to go? The polls suggest that they are being redistributed between Cruz and Kasich, with Donald Trump against sitting there at his usual 30%, 35%. The second issue is we are nine months into--it's been nine months since Donald Trump joined the campaign. We have seven months to go. Now that we are down to three people, it was inevitable that the campaign was going to start focusing on other issues, like nuclear weapons, which he stumbled on this past Tuesday at the town hall at CNN.Gigot: But he would say: Look, I didn't stumble. I said Japan and South Korea and Saudi Arabia should probably develop nuclear weapons. Why should we protect them--continue to protect them?Henninger: But to your earlier point, he's gotten this far mainly by talking about building a wall on the Mexican border and by doing something about trade with China. These two issues he's been able to repeat over and over again in the context of a larger campaign with more people. He's not going to be able to go forward with just two issues anymore. Once he's pressed on some of these things on which he seems not to have educated himself, he's going to run into problems.Riley: The abortion comments were particularly telling, Paul. This is obviously a huge issue to U.S. politics to anyone who's been paying attention over the past 30 years. For him to make that big of a mistake was extremely telling.Gigot: But you don't question his antiabortion bona fides?Riley: Yes, I do.Gigot: I think he's actually sincere about it. I would credit him with sincerity. I think he has not absorbed the argument deeply enough to understand the sort of--Riley: I think you are giving Donald Trump a little bit too much credit. This is a man who has spent his professional career putting his finger to the political wind and pulling out of his checkbook to advance himself financially.Gigot: All right. Let's talk about Ted Cruz, Kim. You've got the Republican establishment of Wisconsin wrapping their arms around him, but not necessarily because they love Cruz but because they want to stop Trump.Strassel: Yes, they have taken the polls here and they realized that he has got a better chance of beating Trump than does John Kasich, or at least that's the betting. So I would argue that a lot of those endorsements that you see coming, like Scott Walker, are coming not necessarily because they endorse Ted Cruz but because they want Donald Trump to be halted before the convention.Gigot: And John Kasich--it's fascinating, Dan. John Kasich is being attacked. Ted Cruz is not focusing on Trump so much. He's attacking John Kasich, who is third in the polls in Wisconsin and who he says has no support. Why is his super PAC hitting Kasich?Henninger: He's hitting Kasich because I think he's worried that Kasich can challenge him in some of the mid-Atlantic states, especially Pennsylvania, the next one up, or places like New York or Connecticut or Maryland. He would just as soon have John Kasich out of the race because everyone now knows this is going to Cleveland, where the delegates are going. He does not want Kasich there spoiling for him.Gigot: I agree, he does not want Kasich to be in the convention. If they don't pick Trump or Cruz, maybe they'll turn to John Kasich.Henninger: Yeah.Gigot: OK. When we come back, the GOP may not be the only party facing convention chaos. After last weekend's three-state sweep, will Bernie Sanders take his fight against Clinton all the way to Philadelphia?***Sanders: I think the momentum is with us. A lot of these super delegates may rethink their positions with Secretary Clinton. A lot of them have not yet declared.Gigot: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is claiming momentum after winning big in all three Western caucuses last weekend. Heading into Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, a new FOX Business poll shows him with a five-point lead over Hillary Clinton, 48% to 43%. Taking nothing for granted, Clinton stumped in her home state of New York this week, where a new poll shows her with a significant but shrinking lead ahead of the April 19 primary there.So, Jason, is Bernie Sanders the racehorse going to catch up on the inside and beat her in an upset?Riley: Not likely. I think he's more like the Rodney Dangerfield of the race for Democrats. He's not getting the respect he deserves.Gigot: And he deserves it.Riley: He deserves a lot of respect, especially while in the caucus states, winning 10 of 12 caucus contests. His problem is he's running out of caucuses. There are only a couple more left. He does not do as well in the primaries.Gigot: Why doesn't he do as well in the primaries?Riley: Well, that's an interesting question. Depending on geographically on where the primaries are located, he has a problem with expanding, you know, racially and ethically, his base of support. Clinton does a much better job of bringing in different types of people. And Bernie Sanders does not have the ability to do that. And that--Gigot: Well, New York--if he wins Wisconsin, even if it's narrowly, he won't get a huge delegate boost but he will get momentum. That makes New York really important. It's Hillary Clinton's state, where she was a senator, where she lives and--Henninger: And the spectacle of her campaigning hard now in Westchester County against the senator from Vermont.Gigot: Where the Clintons live.Henninger: Yeah. I mean, the Democrats have a problem, Paul. And I think Bernie Sanders has already done the damage. He's got enthusiastic support. He's not going to get the nomination. But now the question becomes the same one that the Republicans have with Donald Trump supporters: Will Bernie Sanders turn out--his supporters turn out and vote for her in November? Are they going to be enthusiastic enough, or will they stay home? Keep in mind, a lot of them are college students. College students are hard to turn out. If they get upset and her turnout falls, they've got a big problem in November.Gigot: Yeah. Kim, let's talk about the superdelegates because that's--Bernie Sanders is targeting them now. But there are 712 of those, and it is about a third of the delegates you need to win the nomination to get the majority. So far, the count that AP has--the Associated Press--is 469 for Clinton and 29 for Bernie Sanders. How could he turn those around?Strassel: Right. He likely can't. This is why the Democrats do have a big problem. Give Bernie credit, he plays to win. He's out there and he's trying to turn those superdelegates. But these are party stalwarts. They are the establishment, as it were. They want Hillary Clinton to win, which is why they are behind her, because they think she's got a better shot in the general election. They are not likely to be turned. That's going to bruise a lot of feelings among all those people voting for Bernie Sanders. They'll feel as though the election was stolen in some way from them.Gigot: Think how different the Republican race would be, Jason, if they had superdelegates.Riley: Yeah. But, Hillary's got a little dilemma here, which is that the enthusiasm is with Sanders. She wants that enthusiasm with her, at the end of the day, so she has to find a way to keep him happy. I think he's going to make certain demands at the convention. Hillary Clinton is not opposed to super PACs. She does not want free tuition for everyone in America. Bernie Sanders does, I think, but--Gigot: What are the concessions? Are they to the platform? She's already moved to the left substantially.Riley: I think he's going to want not only a prominent speaking slot at the convention, but yes, changes in the platform.Gigot: Here is a signal that I have been looking at, Dan. Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, darling of the Democratic left--she has not endorsed Sanders. If Sanders really were going to win the nomination or it was that close, I think she would be endorsing him, because she shares more values with him than with Hillary Clinton. Instead, she praised Sanders and said nice things about him. But I think she's waiting to the end to be a broker somehow between the Sanders faction and Secretary Clinton and maybe get on the Clinton ticket.Henninger: I think so. Sen. Warren is very much someone to watch. She's an important player here. And she's the one individual who does want to move this party left in a substantive way, more substantively even than Bernie Sanders. And I think that's the deal that they'll extract from Hillary Clinton: Either you're with us or we won't be able to support you.Gigot: Kim, are we approaching the moment of truth here on the FBI and on Hillary Clinton's emails?Strassel: We're getting much closer. We had a second federal judge now grant discovery to people that work for Hillary Clinton and the State Department. That's going to give some of these outside groups a much better chance than they have ever had to finally get down to what happened on this email scandal.Gigot: All right.When we come back, conservatives are feeling the loss of Justice Antonin Scalia as the divided Supreme Court hands Big Labor a big victory.***Gigot: The loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is being felt by conservatives this week, as the remaining eight justices split 4-4 in one of the most closely watched cases of the term. The results will let Big Labor continue to seize fees from public employees even if they choose not to join a union. This, as Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk became the first Republican to meet with Merrick Garland on Tuesday, leading some to wonder if there are cracks emerging in the Republican Party blockade of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.So, Dan, let's take this case for us, the 4-4 split. This was a free-speech case, or a free association case about whether you're obliged even if you don't belong to a union to pay dues or fees to the union, whose causes you may not support.Henninger: Yeah, that's right. This was called the Friedrichs case, and it was decided 4-4, and so it goes back to the precedent of the lower courts, which is the status quo. The status quo is based on a 1977 case called Abood, which allowed the unions to deduct these fees. Supreme--Justice Roberts, the chief justice, was trying to change this law incrementally, a little bit at a time, and he thought Scalia would help him do that in deciding this case. Scalia's loss makes it clear that those kinds of cases, if you get another liberal justice on the court, will be a slam-dunk for the other side.Gigot: Samuel Alito, Justice Samuel Alito, two years ago, clearly, in his opinion in another case, wanted to go all the way and overturn Abood. But he couldn't--apparently, Justice Roberts, or maybe it was Justice Kennedy, didn't go along, so they brought it up two years later. And now there's no majority for it.And that's what we're going to see, Jason, across so many other cases, isn't it?Riley: Yes, yes. The 4-4 means, as Dan says, it's going to be pushed back down to the lower courts and the precedent will stand. Yeah, we're in for this until a ninth justice joins the court.Gigot: And let's take up that. Is, Jason, there cracks in the Republican opposition to Garland?Riley: I don't think there are cracks that will be large enough to change the position of the majority. But, yes, you do have some senators out there up for re-election in states that Obama won and, in some cases, won twice, and they're feeling the pressure on the re-election campaign to not be seen as an obstructionist, and they want some cover. So you're going to see your Portmans in Ohio, Sen. Portman from Ohio, Senator Toomey in Pennsylvania, and Kirk in Illinois, and in other states--you're going to see them want to give the appearance they're not obstructionists when it comes to this, and maybe hearings should not be out of the question.Gigot: And, Kim, does this suggest that maybe the president's strategy of appointing, nominating Merrick Garland, who is a respected jurist, wide experience on the D.C. Circuit, not a progressive flame-thrower, was pretty savvy, because it's easier to open up some of these areas of disagreement?Strassel: Yes, but only on the margins, I would make the case. I mean, I think that the left and the media have overblown what's going on here. What you essentially have is about 20 Republican senators who have now said they'll have a meeting with the guy. I mean, because it's pretty hard to say that you won't even meet with someone. That has been the main movement that you've seen. You still only have about three Republican senators who are publicly out on the record as saying that they want a hearing. And the reality is, Paul, most of these guys, it would hurt them in their election campaigns to come out and get on board with a hearing or a vote for him. And they all know that in the end.Gigot: And the Senate leadership, Dan--Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Chuck Grassley, who is Judiciary chairman, and Orrin Hatch, former Judiciary chairman--they're all lined up solidly against having hearings, even though I think Orrin Hatch, for example, rather likes Merrick Garland and, you know, might be willing to vote for him under different circumstances.Henninger: Different circumstances. I mean, Hatch also said that he thought that if they were to hold hearings, it would be a circus. And I agree with him. It would just add another ring to the 10-ring circus we've already had so far.Gigot: Yeah, Jason?Riley: This is a risky strategy, Paul. It's a risky political strategy.Gigot: How so? How so? Kim's point is it would hurt Republicans more if they appeared to be considering Garland for approval.Riley: Here's the risk. If Hillary Clinton becomes the next president, Republicans know they can do a lot worse than Merrick Garland. Hillary Clinton may also have a Democratic Senate to work with. Merrick Garland is 63 years old. She'll appoint someone younger and further to the left, almost guaranteed.Gigot: All right. All right. But if you have the election, and then afterwards, and Hillary Clinton wins, why not just approve Garland then, while you still have control over the Senate until January?Riley: If everyone plays along with that. If President Obama doesn't withdraw his name, out of respect to his successor. A lot of other things would--Gigot: Do you think that's likely, Jason?Riley: --have to align. But this is a strategy that does entail some risks.Gigot: I think President Obama would still want to have his appointee approved by the Senate.All right. We have to take one more break. When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.***Gigot: Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week. Kim, start us off.Strassel: So the good news is the Justice Department announced it used the help of an outside, unnamed company to finally crack the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorists and access the data. This is nonetheless a miss for the FBI for its miserable handling of this affair. It claimed for weeks that only Apple could help it do that. It took it to court. It disclosed sensitive information. It made threats against Silicon Valley. If the FBI wants help from Silicon Valley on this vital issue of encryption, it is going to have to be smarter in the way it handles these things.Gigot: All right, thanks, Kim. Jason?Riley: This is a hit for Robert de Niro for choosing not to screen a film at his festival this year that links vaccines to autism. It's junk science, it's been repeatedly and thoroughly debunked by study after study, and spreading this sort of misinformation can do great harm to public health. It was the right call.Gigot: All right. Dan?Henninger: Barack Obama is going to spend his whole presidency missing on the Guantanamo prison issue. He has just announced the release of 12 more prisoners to two unidentified countries--this in the wake of the Brussels massacre.Gigot: Unidentified? Wow.Henninger: That's right. And meanwhile, back in Colorado, the Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, has said there is no way they're taking any prisoners in Colorado, because, guess what, the people there don't want to live nearby. So a hit for Gov. Hickenlooper.Gigot: And Sen. Michael Bennet, who is up for re-election, Democrat, he's also saying don't bring them to Colorado, man. Even though it's a supermax prison there, he says no way. That's because he doesn't want to--he thinks that's a loser politically.Henninger: Yes, so Barack Obama won't even tell us which countries he is shipping them to.Gigot: All right. And remember, if you have your own ""Hit or Miss,"" be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC . That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot.

"How Obama's Economy Spawned Trump; The president had no second act, as millions of Americans are all too painfully aware.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786291172?accountid=12768,"President Obama's remarkable interview last week with the New York Times's Andrew Ross Sorkin shows why historians are likely to assign Mr. Obama a share of responsibility for the rise of Donald Trump.To be sure, the president was dealt a tough hand in 2009, and he played it brilliantly at first. His much-criticized Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, did what was necessary to pull the U.S. financial system back from the brink. Under intense pressure, the president's team crafted a package of steps that saved the American automobile industry. The Obama administration's stimulus package, despite its defects, helped slow a steep economic decline, which at its worst was destroying 800,000 jobs monthly.Mr. Obama has every right to claim credit for preventing a second Great Depression that would have taken down the entire global economy.This was a great first act. Unfortunately, there was no Act 2 and, as Mr. Sorkin reports, Mr. Obama knows it. The president laments, for example, ""our failure in 2012, 2013, 2014, to initiate a massive infrastructure project"" means that ""there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery.""The only problem with the president's lament is its chronology. The failure occurred much earlier, in 2009 and 2010, when Mr. Obama still enjoyed the support of a Democratic-led Congress he needed to move boldly. Despite campaigning for a national infrastructure bank in 2008, he didn't insist on including it in the 2009 stimulus bill. He didn't even publicly raise the matter until September 2010, when the midterm election was looming and the chance of enacting new legislation was effectively nil.This was part of a broader strategic decision to move from his initial focus on averting economic disaster to other concerns--notably, the Affordable Care Act and carbon cap-and-trade legislation. Whatever balance of benefits and opportunity costs the focus on health care may have entailed, the months the House spent in 2009 on an environmental bill that never had a chance in the Senate were a total loss. The exodus of white working-class voters from the Democratic Party contributed to this loss of focus on core economic concerns.When Republicans regained control of the House in November 2010, the moment for an infrastructure bank and an Act 2 economic plan had passed. The result: an economic recovery that was much slower than it had to be.President Obama insists--rightly--that the U.S. has done much better than most other advanced economies. Unemployment has come down further than in Europe, and GDP has risen faster.But most Americans are not comparing the U.S. performance with that of other countries. They are comparing it with previous recoveries in this country, and they are evaluating it in light of their own circumstances. They are painfully aware that their household income is still lower than it was at the end of the Clinton administration and that the jobs many of them have gotten during the recovery pay much less than the jobs they lost during the recession.People intuit what economists have shown: that the share of overall income growth going to average Americans has been lower in recent years than in any prior economic recovery. They don't understand why this is happening, but they do expect their leaders to acknowledge it and do something about it.This is why Mr. Obama is wrong to suggest that his central problem has been an inability to communicate his economic success more effectively. As the old line goes, ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?"" The people have given their answer in the form of the Bernie Sanders insurgency and the Republicans' stunning turn to Donald Trump.It will fall to President Obama's Democratic successor to enact the long-deferred Act 2 of the recovery.In the long run, this means boosting productivity growth and labor-force participation as well as adopting full employment as the explicit goal of economic policy.In the short term, it means inducing corporations to share more of their profits with employees, tearing down the barriers to small business formation, compensating hard-hit workers and communities for the losses they have endured, and at long last creating an infrastructure bank that gets private capital off the sidelines and into the fight to rebuild America.Along with these measures, the metric for success must be broadened. The monthly wage report should have the prominence now reserved for the breathlessly reported jobs numbers. Annual growth in median household incomes should occupy the foreground now dominated by the gross domestic product.Washington is now on notice: The status quo cannot stand. If policy makers don't focus relentlessly on the well-being of average families, Donald Trump's rise has dramatized the menacing alternative--a return to the economic nationalism that disfigured the 1930s and to the ""America First"" foreign policy that nearly handed over Europe to the fascists.Credit: By William A.

Election 2016: Trump Abortion Reversal Fails To Quell Critics,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777414452?accountid=12768,"DE PERE, Wis. -- Donald Trump's recent reversal on abortion is buoying efforts by Republicans to block the presidential front-runner before he claims the nomination, even as Democrats lay the groundwork for attacks in the general election aimed at gutting his support among female voters.His leading GOP rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, is redoubling efforts to court female conservatives in the run-up to Tuesday's primary in Wisconsin. His mother, Eleanor, made a rare campaign appearance Wednesday in Madison with her son, his wife Heidi, and rival-turned-supporter Carly Fiorina in an event that he called a ""celebration of women.""Mr. Cruz sees an opening with female voters following Mr. Trump's statement Wednesday that he favors punishing women who obtain abortions if the procedure was outlawed.After an instant outcry from abortion-rights opponents and backers alike, Mr. Trump recanted, saying only doctors who perform such procedures should be held accountable.The gaffe now sits at the forefront of the case that critics in both parties have been making for months: that Mr. Trump's attitudes toward women and minorities make him a weak general election contender.Mr. Trump's campaign on Thursday didn't respond to a request for comment about the growing criticism of his statements and the conduct of his campaign.Mr. Trump met behind closed doors Thursday with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Afterward, he said on Twitter that he had ""a very nice meeting"" with Mr. Priebus.Criticism of Mr. Trump was expanded further this week to include his aggressive defense of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, charged with battery for allegedly grabbing a female reporter on the arm as she tried to interview the candidate after an event in March.Mr. Trump has also drawn criticism from female supporters -- even loyal conservative commentator Ann Coulter -- for retweeting an unflattering picture of Mr. Cruz's wife.Terese Davis, a 55-year-old voter who attended a Trump event Wednesday in De Pere, left the event saying she was leaning toward the New York businessman. But just a few hours later, she called his equivocation on abortion ""unsettling, for sure,"" and said she was backing away from supporting him.""I would think women altogether should be considering what all this means and its potential impact,"" said Ms. Davis, who called punishing women for getting abortions ""just plain wrong.""Mr. Trump's comments became fodder for the first of what is likely to be a series of women-focused attack ads from the Priorities super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and an arm of Planned Parenthood.In the 2012 election, Democrats similarly cast Republican Mitt Romney as hostile to women by flagging his awkward reference to ""binders full of women,"" as well as his opposition to Planned Parenthood funding and birth-control coverage under the Affordable Care Act.Wall Street Journal/NBC polls show that women's feelings about Mr. Trump are much more negative than they were about Mr. Romney at this point in the campaign four years ago. In March the poll found 70% of women had negative feelings about Mr. Trump, up from 60% in July 2015 as his campaign began. In March 2012, Mr. Romney was viewed negatively by 39% of women.Karen Gething, who attended a Trump rally in Appleton Wednesday, said she wasn't concerned about Mr. Trump's ""off-the-cuff"" comments that some call misogynist. ""I don't believe that is who he truly is,"" she said. ""He's done a lot for women. That gets shoved off to the side.""---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Janet Hook",5/5/16
"Election 2016 -- Politics Counts: The Race for Followers and 'Influencers' --- An analysis of presidential candidates' social-media accounts shows Republican front-runner Donald Trump with the largest following, while Bernie Sanders is winning among young people",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777414135?accountid=12768,"More so than any election before, the 2016 race for the White House is being fueled by Twitter fights and Facebook memes. An analysis of the presidential candidates' social-media followers shows who they are reaching, and suggests how social media could be helping -- or hurting -- the contenders.Businessman Donald Trump has the largest social-media following of the presidential candidates. An analysis by social-media data company Captiv8 of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram followers of the candidates shows that Sen. Bernie Sanders has a strong following from young people, while Republican candidates tend to have more followers over age 30.Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's corps of followers is evenly split between men and women, and her most-engaged followers are 25-34 years old. Of Mr. Trump's most-engaged followers, by comparison, 62% are male and 38% are female, and his most-engaged followers are 30-39 years old. Most-engaged is defined as followers that have liked, commented, shared or retweeted a candidates's social posts.Captiv8 uses image recognition, and links social-media accounts to determine age, gender and location information. The firm says its analysis has a 88%-90% accuracy rate. Captiv8 doesn't track private accounts.Some of Instagram's most-followed accounts, including singers Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus, are following Mrs. Clinton. These so-called ""influencers"" can help Mrs. Clinton spread her message and draw new followers to her account, says Captiv8 founder Krishna Subramanian.Ms. Perry's 44.4 million followers and Ms. Cyrus's 39.8 million followers are king-size compared with the former secretary of state's one million.(See accompanying chart -- WSJ Apr. 1, 2016)Credit: By Natalie Andrews",5/5/16
Trump's Nuclear World,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777413285?accountid=12768,"President Obama hosted the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington on Thursday, and in an ordinary year the headline news might be Vladimir Putin's decision to skip the event, or Mr. Obama's decision to snub Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But this isn't an ordinary year.So leave it to Donald Trump to crash this nuclear party like Zach Galifianakis at an Easter sermon. Asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this week whether he favored Japan and South Korea developing nuclear weapons of their own, the Republican front-runner said he wouldn't mind if they did, and that it's probably only a matter of time before they did so anyway.""At some point we have to say -- you know what? -- we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself,"" he said. Pressed by Mr. Cooper whether there wasn't a benefit to the U.S. in providing (nuclear-backed) security guarantees to our allies in Asia or Europe, Mr. Trump acknowledged ""there's a benefit, but not big enough to bankrupt and destroy the United States, because that's what's happening.""For the record, Japan spends more than $2 billion a year for the privilege of hosting U.S. forces, while South Korea pays close to $900 million, meaning it's cheaper to the U.S. to keep our forces there than bring them home. Both countries also field robust military forces of their own, with South Korea having more ground troops (495,000) than the U.S. Army (475,000). As for Europe, we currently station some 70,000 troops there, down from more than 300,000 during the Reagan years.But facts aside -- with Mr. Trump, that's where the facts often are -- there's still his argument that the U.S. would be better served if some of our non-nuclear allies got bombs of their own. This is not an original idea, and some academics have gone as far as to suggest that wider nuclear proliferation might serve the cause of international peace, while allowing the U.S. to retreat to a classic balance-of-power posture with allies and enemies alike.But the problem with a balance of power is that power doesn't like to stay balanced, as Europeans discovered in 1914. That's especially true in an area such as Northeast Asia, where a nuclear race among historic enemies such as China, Japan and the two Koreas would be inherently treacherous and escalate the risks of a military mistake or a political confrontation.Also not clear is why the example of a nuclear arms race in Asia shouldn't inspire other countries to get in the game. Mr. Cooper asked Mr. Trump whether he would favor Saudi Arabia getting a nuclear weapon, presumably as a hedge against Iran getting the bomb. Mr. Trump equivocated -- ""not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us,"" he said. But if the Trump Doctrine is to insist that our allies ""protect themselves,"" why should they stop at conventional weapons?It's for that reason that U.S. Presidents from Harry Truman to George W. Bush have understood that America's security interests are better served by extending the U.S. nuclear umbrella to allies rather than encouraging them to go nuclear themselves, lest multiple arms races develop around the world, as it already has between India and Pakistan. It's also why Mr. Obama's efforts to shrink the U.S. nuclear arsenal are so dangerous, since it inevitably shrinks the umbrella with it.Similarly, our failure to support Ukraine against Russian aggression after Kiev gave up its large nuclear arsenal in the 1990s in exchange for U.S. guarantees of its territorial sovereignty sends a dangerous signal that countries should hold on to their arsenals rather than trust in Washington's promises.The right response to Mr. Obama's nuclear naivete is to modernize America's aging arsenal and make good on our promises to aid our non-nuclear friends when they are threatened or invaded. Mr. Trump's alternative is a nuclear free-for-all in which atomic weapons will inevitably fall into ever more dubious hands. If the thought of Pakistan having nuclear weapons in its current political state makes you queasy, how will you feel should the Taliban come to power in Islamabad?For all of his criticism of Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump largely shares the President's disdain for the Pax Americana that succeeded in winning the Cold War and preventing nuclear war. The next President should understand the lessons of that peace rather than consign the world to a darker nuclear age.",5/5/16
Trump's Wisconsin Waterloo?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777413170?accountid=12768,"Wisconsin (Ripon, to be exact) is the birthplace of the Republican Party. So perhaps it's fitting that Wisconsin may be the state that takes back the Republican Party from Donald Trump.The Badger State is gearing up to hand the real-estate mogul a defeat, and in the process potentially reroute, yet again, the GOP primary. Polls show Ted Cruz beating Mr. Trump, and some prognosticators have gone so far as to suggest the billionaire could place third -- behind even John Kasich. The opposition to Mr. Trump is deep and wide enough that he could lose most districts.This rebuke has taken a lot of the media and political class by surprise. They figured Mr. Trump would do in this upper Midwestern state what he'd done in other states with a moderate or purplish tint: win. What they missed is Wisconsin's recent political history and changed Republican culture -- which have combined to make the state fertile ground for a Trump takedown.Part of Mr. Trump's problem is simple logistics. Wisconsin was put on the calendar as a stand-alone primary, with two clear weeks before and after it. The field is now down to three candidates. All of this has allowed for far greater scrutiny of Mr. Trump, in the form of heavy in-state advertising and earned media.But it's the in-state dynamics that are hurting him most. Wisconsin has been in continuous political warfare for six years. Over that time, Republicans lived through Gov. Scott Walker's epic battle for his Act 10 public-sector bargaining reform; judicial races; a Senate recall effort; a gubernatorial recall effort; a political assault in a vicious John Doe probe; another election cycle; campaign-finance reform; an overhaul of the state's ethics body; a right-to-work law; and prevailing-wage reform. To name a few.The state is also proudly home to the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, and a governor (Scott Walker) who ran for his party's presidential nomination. The result is a conservative electorate that is highly informed, highly energized and highly involved. The fights so far have given voters an acute appreciation of the conservative principles at stake, and a pride in defeating union and liberal priorities. They have radar sensitive to ""fake"" Republicans, and many aren't keen on what they are hearing from Mr. Trump.Wisconsin's recent political battles also resulted in a dramatic shift in the state's communications culture. Conservative wariness of liberal, in-state newspapers turned to outright loathing as the print media exhibited a continual bias against Mr. Walker and Republicans. Conservatives as a result made talk radio their news hub, and learned to communicate through online and social media.Four ""talkers"" in particular -- Charlie Sykes, Vicki McKenna, Jerry Bader and Mark Belling -- exercise enormous influence, and cover nearly every inch of the state media market. These days, politicians routinely break their news on radio. Gov. Walker announced his recent endorsement of Ted Cruz on the Sykes show. The new chief justice of the state Supreme Court, Patience Roggensack, granted her first interview to Mr. Sykes rather than to a newspaper.Mr. Trump stumbled onto three of the four biggest shows on Monday, seemingly unaware that all the hosts are part of the ""Never Trump"" movement. Mr. Sykes likened Mr. Trump to a ""12-year-old bully"" and insisted he was no conservative. Ms. McKenna was similarly rough, though Mr. Trump did himself no favors by hanging up on her.He's also won no votes by lambasting both Mr. Walker and Paul Ryan. Mr. Trump might have been looking at Mr. Walker's statewide approval numbers (in the 40s) and figured that hitting Mr. Walker's tax cuts was smart politics. But the governor's approval with Republicans is significantly higher -- likely in the 70% to 80% range.Mr. Ryan also is widely liked and admired among Republicans in the state, in particular because he still actively engages in state battles. He regularly goes on talk radio; he has openly supported Walker reforms; he helps out state legislative candidates. Mr. Cruz, by contrast to Mr. Trump, clearly was well briefed on the broader environment. His praise of Messrs. Walker and Ryan earns him strong applause at events, and he's grasped the power of the state radio.Wisconsin meanwhile could be huge. Mr. Trump -- if he loses badly enough -- could come out of this primary with only a half-dozen delegates out of 42. That would all but tank his ability to reach the 1,237 mark for the nomination. Wisconsin could tip this into a contested convention. A bad enough Trump loss might also reset the views of voters in the Northeast primaries coming next.But perhaps the bigger potential for Wisconsin is to reinforce a growing view among organized Republicans that Mr. Trump is indeed a party usurper, and that they have a duty to use an open convention to stop him. The birthplace of the GOP -- and the home of one of the nation's most war-bloodied and conservative crowds -- looks ready to tank Mr. Trump.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",5/5/16
Election 2016: Trump Faces Challenge in Wisconsin --- State's voter-turnout history could be an advantage for Republican rival Cruz,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778075876?accountid=12768,"GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Wisconsin Republicans could be Donald Trump's worst nightmare: a sophisticated electorate guided by a conservative political network that has honed its tactics during 13 state Senate and two statewide recall elections held since Republican Scott Walker became the governor five years ago.Mr. Trump has built a formidable delegate lead in the Republican presidential primary by appealing to people who are infrequent voters. But they are a rarity here -- especially in the vote-rich counties that ring Milwaukee and form the core of the state GOP base.During the 2012 general election, Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington counties each saw turnout of 79% or more. Only one county in the state saw turnout less than 55%, according to the state's Government Accountability Board.""Wisconsin has been through a lot of challenging elections, so people are up on the issues,"" said Alberta Darling, a Republican state senator from the Milwaukee suburb of River Hills who survived a 2011 recall after backing Mr. Walker's repeal of collective bargaining rights for most of the state's public employees.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz barnstormed the state on Sunday, beginning with a Green Bay rally where he was introduced by Mr. Walker, who didn't say Mr. Trump's name but said the state's Republican voters won't be easily swayed.""No matter what anybody says coming into the state, we are well-informed,"" Mr. Walker said.At stake in Tuesday's Wisconsin primary are 42 delegates to the Republican National Convention. Mr. Trump retains a commanding delegate lead, with 736, compared with 463 for his closest rival, Mr. Cruz. A Republican needs to win 1,237 delegates to become the party's nominee. Wisconsin polls show Mr. Cruz holding sizable leads over Mr. Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.Mr. Trump on Sunday called for Mr. Kasich, who is a distant third in the delegate hunt with 142, to end his campaign. ""He's not taking Cruz's votes; he's taking my votes,"" Mr. Trump told reporters in Milwaukee.Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said no Republican candidate will win the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the nomination before the Republican National Convention in July. ""We look forward to Trump dropping out before the convention,"" Mr. Schrimpf said.In addition to a GOP electorate educated on conservative issues, Mr. Cruz has another hidden advantage: Republican voters here show up. Of 10 presidential swing states tracked in a 2012 Bipartisan Policy Center report, only Wisconsin had more than 70% voter turnout in each of the last three presidential elections.And Milwaukee's conservative talk radio hosts have taken a victory lap in the national media after treating the Republican front-runner to a series of rough interviews, touting themselves as the bulwark of the anti-Trump forces.But if Wisconsin hands Mr. Trump a defeat Tuesday, it will be because of voters such as Ed Perkins, a 75-year-old retiree in Grand Chute.Always interested in politics, Mr. Perkins said he first became involved in conservative causes to defend Mr. Walker and Republican state senators during the recall elections of 2011 and 2012. He now leads a local tea-party group and on Friday hosted a Cruz campaign event featuring Mr. Cruz's father, Rafael, at a restaurant in Appleton.""People like myself have become more knowledgeable about what's going on,"" said Mr. Perkins. ""The result of that, of all the candidates, we feel Ted Cruz is the constitutional candidate in front of us.""The Cruz campaign has invested more resources and energy in Wisconsin than has Mr. Trump's. There are 14 Cruz field offices across the state, compared with two for Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz's campaign and his supportive super PAC have blanketed local conservative talk radio with advertisements, while Mr. Trump hasn't.At his stops across the state this weekend, Mr. Cruz argued that his Wisconsin momentum shows he has become the choice of the party's non-Trump majority. In Green Bay on Sunday he warned that a Trump nomination would lead to a double-digit general election victory for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner.""What we're seeing is the 65 to 70% of Republicans who don't want to see that happen are uniting and coming together behind this campaign,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""Wisconsin is the battleground.""Credit: By Reid J. Epstein",5/9/16
Declarations: Trump's Mess Has Become His Message,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778075967?accountid=12768,"This is almost always true:A woman who aborts a child is operating within an emotional and spiritual context of fear, disappointment, confusion and sadness. If she receives an illegal abortion she should not be ""punished"" by the law. This is in line with long human tradition and is based on the simple wisdom that she has already been gravely and tragically penalized: She has lost her child, someone who was very likely going to love her, someone she very likely would have loved. The doctor who performs such an abortion on the other hand is not in turmoil, he is in business. He breaks the law and ends the life of the child with full consciousness, and for profit. He should be ""punished."" He should be in jail.That we even have to discuss this is absurd. It also feels very 1970s, when the subject to so many was new. I guess it's still new to Donald Trump, and so unexamined, un-thought-through. Yes, he walked back or clarified his stand on punishment, and yes, Chris Matthews badgered and browbeat him on MSNBC. But presidential hopefuls, especially Republican ones, are routinely badgered and browbeaten. You have to deal with it. It's part of how you earn the big job.But I feel like we're missing something in this latest.Mr. Trump is hurting himself, in real time and for the first time. We will likely see it, and soon, in the polls. Already his numbers in next week's Wisconsin primary have fallen, and as for women -- well, with women nationally Mr. Trump is currently more popular than cholera, but not by much.We're missing what's happening because we're blocked by cliches. The first great Trump cliche, which began seven or eight months ago, was that he'd quickly do himself in with some outrageous comment. So everyone waited. His insults to John McCain, Megyn Kelly -- that would do it. But it didn't. The more outrageous he was the stronger he got.So a new cliche was born, the still-reigning one: Whatever Mr. Trump says it won't hurt him, people will just love him more.But that's not right. It was always a mistake to think one explosive statement would blow his candidacy up. What could damage him, and is damaging him, is the aggregate -- a growing pile of statements and attitudes that becomes a mood, a warning sign, a barrier.It's been going on for four or five weeks, and you can take your pick as to the tipping point. Maybe it was when he threatened to ""spill the beans"" on another candidate's wife, or when he retweeted the jeering pictures of her and his own wife. Maybe it was his inability to clearly, promptly denounce the KKK; maybe it was when he hinted at riots if he's cheated out of the nomination. Maybe it was Corey Lewandowski's alleged battery of reporter Michelle Fields. Maybe it was when Mr. Trump referred in debate to his genitals, a true national first.It has all added up into a large blob of sheer dumb grossness. He is now seriously misjudging the room. The room is still America.I speak to Trump supporters a lot, and they are getting embarrassed. Their feeling was perfectly encapsulated by what Ann Coulter said on a podcast after the retweeting of the wives' photos: ""Do you realize our candidate is mental?"" She said of having to defend his mad statements and tweets: ""It's like constantly having to bail out your 16-year-old son from prison.""It has left me thinking about the political theory of The Mess. The Mess is something a candidate occasionally brings with him that voters can tell is going to cause trouble down the road. The Mess is a warning sign; it tells potential supporters to slow down, think twice. The Mess might be a pattern of scrapes with the law, a series of love affairs or other scandals. Voters will accept normal, flawed human beings but they don't like patterns of bad behavior. They don't like when they see a Mess, because they don't want to elect trouble to high office. Donald Trump's Mess is his mouth, his indiscipline, his refusal to be . . . serious.At the same time Mr. Trump doesn't even seem to be trying to do the one big thing he has to do now. He is the front-runner for the nomination. At this point it is his job to keep the support he has and persuade those who don't like him to give him a second or third look. To do that he only has to be more thoughtful, stable and mature in his approach -- show he may be irrepressible and fun and surprising, even shocking, but at bottom he has within him a plausible president.Instead, he is stuck at nutty. Rather than attempt to win over, he doubles down. In the process he shows that what occupies his mind isn't big issues, significant questions or the position of the little guy, but subjects that are small, petty, unworthy.Instead of reassuring potential or reluctant supporters, he has given them pause. Instead of gathering in, he is repelling. This is political malpractice on a grand scale.It was always Mr. Trump who was the only one big enough to take down Mr. Trump. He may be doing it. In the process he does a great favor to his current and potential opponents. One of the things Mr. Trump does is make everyone else look normal. His outrageousness cancels out theirs. Once Hillary Clinton was too corrupt to be elected, had too many negatives, too much bad history from her early days in Arkansas to the Clinton Foundation, Benghazi, the emails. She brought and brings quite a mess.But his mess cancels out her mess.The sheer force of Donald Trump's weird, outsized strangeness has made her look normal. It's made Ted Cruz look normal too, like a nice, sincere fella right in the middle of the political bell curve.There are people who used to dismiss Trump supporters, and who later self-corrected to show compassion from great heights: ""My God, they're suffering in America."" They have now taken a newly jaundiced eye -- his supporters are his enablers.My thought is different. Maybe the sadness here is that Mr. Trump's supporters are earnest and full of concern for America and he isn't worthy of them. Maybe he only harnessed their legitimate anger but can't do anything with it because he's not as serious as so many of them are, but a flake, a dope with poor impulse control.What happens to Trumpism -- his stands on illegal immigration, trade, entitlements -- when Mr. Trump is gone? Does he have any sense of responsibility for what he leads?And the immediate question: Is it possible he can change and be worthy of the moment? I don't know but doubt it, because in my observation people at the end of middle age don't usually change, they just become more so. In any case it's getting late. So far Donald Trump has conquered all expectations, half-conquered the American political system, and almost conquered one of our two great political parties. It is sad he can't conquer himself.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",5/9/16
Trump Struggles To Regain His Mojo,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778075758?accountid=12768,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump, having hit a rough patch in the campaign, is trying to get back on track and cast himself as the party's presumptive presidential nominee.To do that, Mr. Trump is turning to the nation's capital that he has demonized: The New York businessman has moved to open his first campaign office in Washington, met with foreign-policy advisers and party leaders Thursday, named two House members to reach out to colleagues on his behalf and hired veteran GOP strategist Paul Manafort to manage his operation at the party convention.""He is pivoting toward the general election,"" said Rep. Chris Collins (R., N.Y.), one of his congressional backers. ""As a candidate who entered this race without any political experience, you expect him to encounter growing pains. Mr. Trump is adjusting accordingly.""More urgently, Mr. Trump returns Saturday to Wisconsin, scene of the next primary, where he faces the biggest remaining obstacle to clinching the party's nomination. Polls show his chief rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, enjoys a strong lead in Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday's vote -- even though the state's Republican electorate, dominated by white blue-collar voters, seems tailor-made for a Trump victory.Mr. Cruz is capitalizing on recent headlines -- including Mr. Trump's comments about abortion punishment, and police charges against his top adviser for allegedly grabbing a female reporter -- that have become unsettling even for the businessman's own supporters.""It's been a bad two weeks,"" said former Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who endorsed Mr. Trump just two weeks ago.Some Republican strategists say Mr. Trump is at a campaign crossroads, where he needs an approach that reaches beyond the people drawn to him because of his unconventional style and allays the fears of other Republicans who worry that his nomination would do long-term damage to the party.""There are a very small group of Republicans that have put him where he is today, and he's got to expand that group and move the dial on his approval ratings,"" said Fred Malek, a GOP fundraiser who is neutral in the race.""I think we've seen a very long phase in which voters have been impressed and even mesmerized by his irreverence, frankness and spontaneity, and many people are now looking for something more long lasting. I felt a shift this week, with so much focus on the negatives,"" Mr. Malek said.Among the negatives: Mr. Trump has been bested by Mr. Cruz in Louisiana and other states in the arcane process of placing supporters in convention delegate slots. He seemed to be blindsided in combative interviews with influential talk-radio hosts in Wisconsin. And he attacked Mr. Cruz's wife Heidi, tweeting an unflattering photo of her next to one of Mr. Trump's own wife, Melania.Many Republicans were particularly put off by the imbroglios over abortion, the reporter and Mrs. Cruz because they could make it harder for the GOP to win over female voters, who tend to favor the Democratic Party. Polls today suggest the GOP could lose among women by landslidemargins in the fall if Mr. Trump were their nominee against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump has survived firestorms before and has emerged just as strong if not stronger in the polls. But this time, Mr. Trump may pay a political price in Wisconsin, where the stop-Trump movement is positioned to score its biggest victory of the primary season.""Sheer personality and entertainment skills will get you so far, but it won't get you all the way,"" said Randy Evans, a member of the RNC from Georgia who is neutral in the race. ""Wisconsin has turned into a referendum on Donald Trump, and he has to recalibrate. He has to win that referendum.""Mr. Trump drew some praise when he delivered a more carefully-scripted speech -- read from a teleprompter -- before last week's meeting of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee. But Mr. Trump's spontaneity is big part of his appeal as a candidate, and some supporters say it would be a mistake to change.""I would agree that this has not been the best week of the campaign,"" said Susan Wiles, a GOP consultant who co-chaired the Trump primary campaign in Florida. But she added, ""he needs to keep doing exactly what he's been doing because, when he does, people come his way.""Still a more low-key style could help him with swing voters, if a recent campaign stop in Wisconsin is any indication.At an event held at St. Norbert College in De Pere on Wednesday, Mr. Trump turned down the volume and gave young people in the audience some advice about how to get ahead.Telling stories about friends and associates who had both succeeded and failed, Mr. Trump boiled it down to a few motivational principles: Do what you love; don't lose momentum; work hard, but get lucky. He quoted golfer Gary Player saying, ""The harder I work the luckier I get.""He still included anti-Cruz rhetoric -- ""I call him 'Lyin' Ted,'"" he said -- but by spending about half his time in an uncharacteristically low-key talk about something other than politics, he turned some heads. Wendy Larson, a 45-year-old lawyer who came to the event undecided, came out a Trump supporter. ""There was none of the frenzied circus I've seen on TV,"" she said.That didn't last for long.Less than 24 hours after his business-like meetings in Washington, Mr. Trump was back on Twitter and on the attack: ""Does anybody like Lyin' Ted?"" he tweeted, linking to a video in which a former Cruz college roommate criticizes the senator.---Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook",5/9/16

Donald Trump Says He Wouldn't Seek to Renegotiate U.S. Debt; GOP candidate pushes buying back Treasury notes during high interest rates as way to lower debt,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787583538?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump said Monday he wouldn't seek to renegotiate the national debt with the country's creditors but suggested the government could buy back Treasury notes in times of high interest rates to reduce the overall debt burden.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee sought to clarify comments he made last week to CNBC that led many observers to speculate he was advocating for some kind of strategic default.""This is the U.S. government,"" he said in the Monday interview. ""The bonds are absolutely sacred.""At the same time, he suggested he would be open to buying back Treasury notes if interest rates rise, as a way to bring down the country's debt load. Bond prices fall as rates rise, which means the government theoretically could turn a profit by buying back debt for less than when it was issued.""With the U.S. government, there are times on occasion you can buy back debt at a discount, meaning the interest rate goes up and you buy back debt at a discount.""But such a move would likely require issuing new debt to buy back the old debt. And since that new debt would be issued at higher interest rates, it's not clear that type of buyback would save money in the long run.In the interview, Mr. Trump also said he supported holding down the value of the dollar in order to help American manufacturing and the economy.""If the value of the dollar goes up, it would be at this point not a very good thing,"" he said.Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.comCredit: By David Harrison",5/10/16

The problem is that Mr. Walker has the facts on his side.""He's not doing a great job,"" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Walker last week, adding that Wisconsin is ""an incredible place, but it's a place you have problems."" He cited the jobless and labor participation rates, among other things, but he needs a better campaign research staff.The Badger State's jobless rate was 4.6% in February, below the 4.9% national average (which bumped up to 5% in March). Wisconsin's labor participation rate rose to 68.7% in February from 68.4% the month before. That's lower than the 70.9% that Wisconsin reached in February 2007, but then the labor participation rate has fallen much further in the rest of the U.S. The national labor participation rate inched up to 63% in March, which is still close to lows last seen in the late 1970s. According to Congress's Joint Economic Committee, only six states have a higher labor participation rate than Wisconsin.The reality is that -- like Ohio, Michigan and Indiana -- Wisconsin has been doing well in the wake of conservative reforms. These include Act 10, which reduced the monopoly power of public unions, tax reduction and regulatory reforms, school-choice expansion and more recently a right-to-work law that lets workers choose whether to join a union and pay dues.Mr. Trump was able to defeat Mr. Walker in the presidential race, but he won't succeed in persuading voters not to believe what they've witnessed with their own eyes.",5/10/16

"Trump in Control After Cruz Exits --- Sanders beats Clinton, though his win will do little to disrupt her path to Democratic nomination",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786422422?accountid=12768,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Donald Trump almost certainly snared the Republican Party's presidential nomination by winning a sweeping victory in Indiana's primary Tuesday and forcing his chief rival from the race.Mr. Trump's decisive victory didn't mathematically clinch the GOP nomination, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's departure from the campaign means all that stands between the first-time candidate and accepting the party's nomination in Cleveland is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has won just one state out of 41 so far.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus quickly rallied behind Mr. Trump, calling him the presumptive nominee in a tweet. ""We all need to unite and focus on defeating"" Hillary Clinton, he tweeted.In his victory rally remarks in New York, Mr. Trump himself seemed surprised that the last significant roadblock to his nomination was gone. ""I didn't expect this,"" he said. ""I didn't expect it.""His triumph comes at the tail end of a nominating contest that has defied convention, splintered the party, and left nearly two-thirds of all general election voters with a negative view of Mr. Trump heading into his expected general-election showdown with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Nationwide, Mr. Trump is viewed unfavorably by 65% of voters, according to last month's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. That is higher than Mrs. Clinton, who is seen unfavorably by 56% of voters.In Indiana's Democratic contest, Mrs. Clinton lost to rival Bernie Sanders. However, the Vermont senator's victory margin wasn't large enough to disrupt her path toward her party's nomination.In dropping out of the race, Mr. Cruz conceded he couldn't stop Mr. Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the GOP nomination at the party's July convention.With a sweep of Indiana's 57 delegates, Mr. Trump needs just 225 more. With nine states to go, including Nebraska and West Virginia next week and California on June 7, Mr. Trump needs less than half of the remaining bound delegates to become the nominee.For Mr. Cruz, Tuesday's contest had been his strongest opportunity to change the momentum of the GOP campaign. His team for weeks had pointed to the Midwestern state, comparing it to Wisconsin, where the Texas senator won a convincing victory over Mr. Trump last month.But Mr. Cruz never gained traction in the state. A series of decisions designed to boost his prospects, including naming Carly Fiorina as his running mate, were seen by many voters more as acts of desperation than smart maneuvers.In a concession speech in Indianapolis, Mr. Cruz didn't mention or congratulate Mr. Trump. He said he had planned to stay in the race as long as he saw a path to the convention.""Tonight, I'm sorry to say, it appears that path has been foreclosed,"" he said. ""Together, we left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we've got. But the voters chose another path. And so with a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism for the long term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.""Mr. Kasich's campaign on Tuesday said it would continue until Mr. Trump officially clinches the nomination, which can't happen until California and four other states hold primaries June 7. ""Ted Cruz ran a strong campaign, stood for conservative principles, and exposed a lot about Donald Trump,"" Kasich strategist John Weaver said. ""Gov. Kasich will continue to campaign and offer the voters a clear choice for our country.""Katie Packer, who leads an anti-Trump super PAC that spent $1.3 million against Mr. Trump in Indiana, said her group will continue to fight against the front-runner. ""There is more than a month before the California primary -- more time for Trump to continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters,"" she wrote.Mr. Trump, in victory remarks at Trump Tower in New York that were unusually subdued, hewed to his central campaign message of rescinding international trade deals and promising to create jobs -- in this case for coal miners in West Virginia, which holds the next primary contest May 10.He congratulated Mr. Cruz for being ""one hell of a competitor"" and called the senator's family ""beautiful,"" just hours after accusing Mr. Cruz's father of being complicit in John F. Kennedy's assassination.""Our theme is very simple,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's make America great again. We will make America great again. We will start winning again. You will be so proud of this country very, very soon.""With his hold on the GOP nomination seen as inevitable, Mr. Trump would become the first candidate from either major party to win a presidential nomination without elected or military experience since 1940, when Republican Wendell Willkie lost to President Franklin Roosevelt.Mr. Trump's Indiana victory came after he and Mr. Cruz engaged in the most heated rhetoric of the campaign to date.After Mr. Trump accused Mr. Cruz's father of abetting the Kennedy assassination, Mr. Cruz responded with a stream of epithets, including ""pathological liar,"" ""utterly amoral,"" a ""narcissist,"" and ""serial philanderer.""Mr. Trump responded on Twitter shortly after voting closed at 7 p.m. EDT: ""Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure -- not very presidential. Sad!""The extreme remarks came as part of Mr. Cruz's last-ditch effort to stop Mr. Trump in Indiana, a state he declared would determine the fate of his campaign.Mr. Trump secured his front-runner status on a relatively shoestring budget. His campaign has spent $47 million through the end of March, the latest figures available, of which $35.9 million came in personal loans to the campaign.Mr. Cruz spent $70 million during the same time frame, and a pro-Cruz super PAC doled out $43.6 million to help his candidacy.The businessman now faces the challenge of funding a general election battle against Hillary Clinton, who has raised $213 million in contributions through the end of April.In the 2012 campaign, President Barack Obama spent $721 million and GOP nominee Mitt Romney spent $450 million. Outside groups spent an additional $550 million on the race.One challenge for Mr. Trump heading into the general election will be either raising hundreds of millions of dollars from the very Republican donors he castigated throughout the primary campaign or dipping into his personal fortune at a scale to which he has been resistant so far. Early in the campaign Mr. Trump resisted calls to spend money on advertising, field staff and political professionals. He still doesn't have a polling expert on his staff.---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein and Byron Tau",5/11/16
Politics & Ideas: How Obama's Economy Spawned Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786417494?accountid=12768,"President Obama's remarkable interview last week with the New York Times's Andrew Ross Sorkin shows why historians are likely to assign Mr. Obama a share of responsibility for the rise of Donald Trump.To be sure, the president was dealt a tough hand in 2009, and he played it brilliantly at first. His much-criticized Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, did what was necessary to pull the U.S. financial system back from the brink. Under intense pressure, the president's team crafted a package of steps that saved the American automobile industry. The Obama administration's stimulus package, despite its defects, helped slow a steep economic decline, which at its worst was destroying 800,000 jobs monthly.Mr. Obama has every right to claim credit for preventing a second Great Depression that would have taken down the entire global economy.This was a great first act. Unfortunately, there was no Act 2 and, as Mr. Sorkin reports, Mr. Obama knows it. The president laments, for example, ""our failure in 2012, 2013, 2014, to initiate a massive infrastructure project"" means that ""there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery.""The only problem with the president's lament is its chronology. The failure occurred much earlier, in 2009 and 2010, when Mr. Obama still enjoyed the support of a Democratic-led Congress he needed to move boldly. Despite campaigning for a national infrastructure bank in 2008, he didn't insist on including it in the 2009 stimulus bill. He didn't even publicly raise the matter until September 2010, when the midterm election was looming and the chance of enacting new legislation was effectively nil.This was part of a broader strategic decision to move from his initial focus on averting economic disaster to other concerns -- notably, the Affordable Care Act and carbon cap-and-trade legislation. Whatever balance of benefits and opportunity costs the focus on health care may have entailed, the months the House spent in 2009 on an environmental bill that never had a chance in the Senate were a total loss. The exodus of white working-class voters from the Democratic Party contributed to this loss of focus on core economic concerns.When Republicans regained control of the House in November 2010, the moment for an infrastructure bank and an Act 2 economic plan had passed. The result: an economic recovery that was much slower than it had to be.President Obama insists -- rightly -- that the U.S. has done much better than most other advanced economies. Unemployment has come down further than in Europe, and GDP has risen faster.But most Americans are not comparing the U.S. performance with that of other countries. They are comparing it with previous recoveries in this country, and they are evaluating it in light of their own circumstances. They are painfully aware that their household income is still lower than it was at the end of the Clinton administration and that the jobs many of them have gotten during the recovery pay much less than the jobs they lost during the recession.People intuit what economists have shown: that the share of overall income growth going to average Americans has been lower in recent years than in any prior economic recovery. They don't understand why this is happening, but they do expect their leaders to acknowledge it and do something about it.This is why Mr. Obama is wrong to suggest that his central problem has been an inability to communicate his economic success more effectively. As the old line goes, ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?"" The people have given their answer in the form of the Bernie Sanders insurgency and the Republicans' stunning turn to Donald Trump.It will fall to President Obama's Democratic successor to enact the long-deferred Act 2 of the recovery.In the long run, this means boosting productivity growth and labor-force participation as well as adopting full employment as the explicit goal of economic policy.In the short term, it means inducing corporations to share more of their profits with employees, tearing down the barriers to small business formation, compensating hard-hit workers and communities for the losses they have endured, and at long last creating an infrastructure bank that gets private capital off the sidelines and into the fight to rebuild America.Along with these measures, the metric for success must be broadened. The monthly wage report should have the prominence now reserved for the breathlessly reported jobs numbers. Annual growth in median household incomes should occupy the foreground now dominated by the gross domestic product.Washington is now on notice: The status quo cannot stand. If policy makers don't focus relentlessly on the well-being of average families, Donald Trump's rise has dramatized the menacing alternative -- a return to the economic nationalism that disfigured the 1930s and to the ""America First"" foreign policy that nearly handed over Europe to the fascists.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Obama Economy Didn't Spawn Trump's Surge"" -- WSJ May. 11, 2016)Credit: By William A.

Trump Declares War on Mexico,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786417434?accountid=12768,"For decades it suited citizens on both sides to ignore the U.S.-Mexico border for labor contracting purposes; federal law even provided a de facto amnesty with a five-year statute of limitations on illegal entry.Today, if anyone cared to, illegal immigration could easily be solved by introducing a fraud-proof national ID card with biometric information; make it illegal, with real penalties, for employers to hire anyone, citizen or immigrant, who doesn't have one.Voila, no need for a wall, though we also detect no appetite for a real immigration solution. Most Americans continue to favor eventual legalization for those already here. Even Donald Trump's incessant thumping has only raised immigration to a middling issue. Right now, the net people flow is toward the south. Their economy is growing faster than ours. There's even reason to suspect the U.S. border crackdown has hindered movement back to Mexico.Yet candidate Trump incessantly attacks Mexico not only over immigration, but over the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of those ""stupid"" trade deals negotiated by our ""stupid"" negotiators. How did Mexico become enemy No. 1? Good question. The lyrics of Mr. Trump's recent foreign policy speech may have been non compos mentis but the music featured an authentic lilt. The world is becoming more chaotic; the U.S. in the future will be selecting its commitments more circumspectly and economically.Unbelievably, then, Mr. Trump picks a fight with one of America's most important strategic partners in such a world.He complains about Carrier Corp. relocating factory jobs to Mexico, but how else are U.S. companies to compete and preserve their remaining jobs? Carrier is only No. 4 on a list of global air-conditioner brands that includes three Japanese, two Korean, two Indian and a Swedish company.Ford Motor Co. has been especially berated by Mr. Trump for building cars in Mexico, but what's a better way for Ford to compete and protect its market share against Japanese, Korean and German makers who (let's face it) mostly build their cars in U.S. Southern states with nonunion workers?We haven't even mentioned the growing collective power of the U.S., Canada and Mexico as energy exporters. Nafta is our safe harbor, our fortress, in an anarchic world.Yet Mr. Trump's campaign has been a litany of threats directed primarily against one nation -- Mexico. He threatens a trade war to make Mexico pay for his wall. He threatens visa restrictions on Mexican visitors. He threatens to seize the money Mexican workers send home to their families.These are Putinesque extortions. In a memo to the Washington Post, Mr. Trump as much as says that Mexico is a weak punching bag and would have no choice but to yield to America's superior leverage.Mr. Trump flogs our southern neighbor for the puniest of political reasons, because it riles up a certain class of voter. During the Wisconsin primary, 10-year-old girls at a kid's soccer game, for the benefit of a visiting team heavy on ethnic minorities, chanted ""Donald Trump, build that wall!"" As California's primary approaches, Trump rallies bring violent confrontations between police and Latino demonstrators, some of whom wave the Mexican flag. As Vladimir Putin learned in Ukraine, even weak countries don't take well to being humiliated. It creates a constituency for outcomes that are self-defeating for all concerned.Of course, it's always possible that President Trump would disown his Mexico-first foreign policy as quickly as he did two wives. His most prominent business endorser, Carl Icahn, assures us Mr. Trump would be a ""pragmatist.""The Trump phenomenon's chin-stroking analysts are right about one thing: The unskilled, unmobile, small-town American manufacturing worker who makes up his most important support base has largely been sold short by our political system. (As a side note, the political system has hardly leapt to the defense of newspaper workers rendered jobless by Craigslist.)There's a reason for this: Business owners, their employees and their consumers who benefit from trade are more numerous and have more clout. On balance, the years 1982-2006, which coincided with a dramatic relocation of the world's manufacturing to Asia, were pretty decent ones for the U.S. economy.When he ran for president in 2008, Barack Obama had the good sense to be pleasantly vague, noncommittal and even obfuscatory about his agenda, and as a consequence didn't expend any political capital later disowning campaign promises.Mr. Trump, arguably, is not a more oafish or unsubtle politician, but he never would have propelled himself into contention without his ""wall"" -- a singularly concrete promise of change. Just about everything else Mr. Trump says, such as his vow to replace ObamaCare with ""something wonderful,"" outdoes even Mr. Obama for vapidity.But would President Trump really want to throw his first year down the toidy by provoking an unnecessary showdown with an American ally? If not, the biggest mystery of his first days in office might be what flamboyant excuse he dreams up for changing the subject.Credit: By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.",5/11/16
Indiana Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786415851?accountid=12768,"With Ted Cruz's withdrawal from the race after his loss Tuesday, Donald Trump should be well on the road to the 1,237 delegates needed to secure a nomination majority in advance of the convention.Mr. Trump's Tuesday victory in Indiana shows that he was able to transform his wins in the recent eastern primaries into momentum that overwhelmed Mr. Cruz, despite a strong effort from the Senator in the Hoosier State. It wasn't enough to overcome the consolidation of Republican support by the New York businessman.While by no means minimizing Mr. Trump's considerable achievement here, we must ask again why Senator Cruz made so little effort to expand his appeal beyond the slice of very conservative voters who were his target from the start. The time to do that was after his Wisconsin victory, but the broadening never came, and Mr. Trump continued to siphon away the greater share of the GOP primary vote.Mr. Trump won Indiana among most demographic, income and ideological groups, while Mr. Cruz carried ""very conservative"" voters and people with post-graduate degrees. Mr. Trump won 46% of women to Mr. Cruz's 42%.Now as the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party, it is past time for Mr. Trump to start acting like it. He says that it's time for the GOP to ""unify."" But most of the responsibility for unification is now his.It is up to Mr. Trump to prevent the emergence of a third-party challenge by convincing his conservative detractors that it is not necessary. That would include behaving in a way that reduces his epic unfavorable numbers with many voters.Some Republican voters are still looking for a reason to believe he has a chance against Hillary Clinton and a Democratic party that is likely to unite around its nominee. Despite the vulnerabilities shown again in her Indiana loss to Bernie Sanders, Mr. Trump isn't going to beat Hillary Clinton with an insult campaign. Mr. Trump could start by doing some homework on issues he would have to deal with as President. He cannot expect undecided voter to simply trust that he'll do that if he becomes President.Republican voters in their wisdom have rallied to Donald Trump to break up the Washington status quo. His job is not to let them down.",5/11/16
Election 2016: Front-Runner Strengthens Base in GOP --- Voters drawn more to Trump's working-class appeal than to Cruz's social conservatism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786415721?accountid=12768,"Sen. Ted Cruz built his campaign on an appeal to social conservatives and the party's most ideologically driven voters. While those voters carried Mr. Cruz to victory in nine caucuses and primaries, too many of them, in the end, were drawn to Donald Trump.In Indiana and many other states, Mr. Cruz couldn't build the conservative coalition he imagined. Evangelical Christians made up 61% of Indiana's Republican voter pool, a higher share than in other Rust Belt primaries. Mr. Trump won more of their votes in Indiana than did Mr. Cruz, exit polls showed.Similarly, Mr. Trump had out polled Mr. Cruz by more than 7 percentage points among evangelicals in all prior primaries, aggregated exit poll results from those states show.Some 77% of Indiana's GOP voters described themselves as conservative, a higher share than in several other Rust Belt states. But Mr. Cruz won only the ""very conservative"" voters while losing a larger group -- self-described ""somewhat conservative"" voters -- by 20 percentage points, Indiana exit polls reported by various media showed.Similarly, Mr. Trump had bested Mr. Cruz among ""somewhat conservative"" voters in combined results from prior contests, winning 43% of their votes, to 22% for Mr. Cruz.Unable to hold his base, Mr. Cruz was overwhelmed as Mr. Trump posted big margins among voters who weren't part of the Cruz coalition, in particular lower-income Republicans and those who lack a four-year college degree. Many of them identified both as evangelical and working-class, and they were drawn more to Mr. Trump's blue-collar appeal than to Mr. Cruz's social conservatism.In the primaries before Indiana, Mr. Trump topped Mr. Cruz by 22 percentage points among voters with only a high school education, according to the analysis of prior exit poll results, by Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. Mr. Trump won with a similarly large margin among voters with some college education but no four-year degree.That pattern held in Indiana, as Mr. Trump carried nearly 59% of voters without a college degree, exit polls reported by various media showed.On a day that the Republican campaign took a bizarre turn, with Mr. Trump in a TV interview linking Mr. Cruz's father to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, GOP primary voters decreed that it was Mr. Cruz who ran a more unfair campaign. That served as one more sign of Mr. Cruz's weakness in the state.Some 42% said Mr. Cruz's campaign had been the most unfair, with 38% saying Mr. Trump ran the more unfair campaign, preliminary exit poll results reported by various media showed. The results may have reflected voter unease with a tenuous deal Mr. Cruz struck with another candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, in which Mr. Kasich would tone down his efforts in Indiana in return for Mr. Cruz doing so in several other states.Mr. Cruz's last significant victory came in the Wisconsin primary in early April. In the subsequent contests, Mr. Trump has enormous advantages across the Republican electorate.In the six contests before Indiana, Mr. Trump lost only a single county. Big cities, inner suburbs and college towns that had eluded Mr. Trump in early contests began to fall his way in later contests, as they did in Indiana. Mr. Trump looked set to win populous Indianapolis, Gary and South Bend, as well as many of the suburbs around those cities.In the Democratic race, the votes of white Hoosiers gave Sen. Bernie Sanders an unexpected victory against Hillary Clinton.Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton had split the votes of white Democrats throughout their long campaign, with each, in the aggregate, drawing about half. On Tuesday those voters tilted heavily toward Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders carried some 57% of white voters, exit polls reported by various media showed. That proved decisive in an election in which white voters accounted for nearly three-quarters of the Democratic voter pool.Turnout declined sharply in the Democratic primary from the party's last competitive Indiana contest, in 2008, based on preliminary results from Tuesday.For example, St. Joseph County, home of South Bend, produced about 32,000 votes on Tuesday. In 2008, it had produced more than 63,000.Credit: By Dante Chinni and Aaron Zitner",5/11/16
Election 2016: Cruz Confident of Beating Trump in Wisconsin Vote,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778346820?accountid=12768,"KENOSHA, Wis. -- As Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump finished campaign sprints across Wisconsin on Monday, the Texan appeared on the verge of his first primary victory in more than a month over the Republican presidential front-runner.In a jovial mood during a campaign appearance at the Mars Cheese Castle here on Monday, Mr. Cruz all but predicted a Tuesday victory in between sampling cheese curds, jalapeno cheese bread and cheese popcorn.""The people of Wisconsin, they are looking at the records of the candidates, and they realize that Donald screams and yells a lot, but he has no solutions,"" Mr. Cruz said.In La Crosse, Wis., on Monday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the state could deal him only his second primary-state loss since March 1. ""It may not happen, because we have the machine against us,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to the state's entire Republican apparatus.Mr. Cruz's stop at the iconic 25,000-square-foot cheese emporium came as he focused the final days of his Wisconsin campaign on the vote-rich southeastern corner of the state, where GOP statewide elections usually are decided. He also filmed a Fox News town hall in Madison, stopped at an Italian market in Milwaukee and planned a large evening rally in Waukesha, home to the state's largest concentration of Republican voters.Mr. Cruz holds double-digit leads in statewide polling, though Mr. Trump is strong in the state's rural western and northern congressional districts, home to the rural, economically strained voters who have been strong constituencies for him elsewhere.On Tuesday, Wisconsin will award 42 delegates to the Republican National Convention, with 24 divided between the state's eight congressional districts and 14 going to the statewide winner.Mr. Trump focused his attention on the state's distant corners, in La Crosse in the southwest along the Minnesota border, and the far north on the shores of Lake Superior.In Superior, Mr. Trump derided the ""never Trump"" movement seeking to stop him with a barrage of negative advertising. ""If they worked this hard to stop Obama, Obama wouldn't have had a chance,"" the billionaire said.Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is competitive in only one of the state's eight congressional districts and lags far behind in polls, campaigned Monday in New York, instead of making a final Wisconsin push.One challenge for Mr. Cruz, who hasn't won a primary state since Texas and Oklahoma on March 1, is finding how he could repeat a Wisconsin victory in other states that don't produce the kinds of headwinds that have slowed Mr. Trump in the last two weeks here.Mr. Trump has only lost three primary states so far: Texas and Oklahoma, where Mr. Cruz was essentially playing on home turf, and Ohio, where Mr. Kasich mobilized his home-state Republican machine to boost him to victory.Still, Mr. Cruz, who trailed Mr. Trump in Wisconsin polling conducted weeks ago, before the GOP field winnowed to three candidates, stressed the comeback nature of his candidacy here.""Just a couple of weeks ago, all of the media commentators were saying Wisconsin is a state where I could not compete,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""They were saying it is a natural state for Donald Trump.""Campaigning with Mr. Cruz at the cheese shop, onetime rival candidate Scott Walker, Wisconsin's governor, predicted the state would serve as a bellwether for states still to hold nominating contests. ""You could start to see a shift of momentum, of people starting to open up the door to see who Ted is,"" he said.But for Mr. Cruz, the political mechanics in Wisconsin are more like Ohio than the next states on the calendar: the Northeastern states of New York on April 19, then Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island a week later. Those states have fewer conservatives and more moderate Republicans.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein and Janet Hook",5/11/16
"Trump's Path Gets Bumpier --- Trailing in Wisconsin polls, GOP front-runner faces an increasingly difficult delegate fight",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778346707?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsTexas Sen. Ted Cruz won Idaho's Republican presidential primary on March 8. A Page One article Tuesday about the fight for delegates incorrectly said he hadn't won a state primary since March 1.(WSJ Apr. 8, 2016)WEST ALLIS, Wis. -- A loss in Wisconsin's primary Tuesday would make Donald Trump's path to clinching the Republican presidential nomination before the party's July convention increasingly narrow.Mr. Trump must capture two-thirds of the remaining bound delegates -- those committed to vote for a specific candidate -- to reach the 1,237 needed to win the GOP presidential nomination on the convention's first ballot, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. If Mr. Trump claims no delegates in Wisconsin, he would have to win 70% of the remaining bound delegates.The New Yorker's path is made steeper by his campaign's weakness in states that allow delegates to remain uncommitted to a specific candidate. In North Dakota this weekend, Cruz supporters were picked for 18 of 25 unbound-delegate slots at the state GOP convention. Delegates to be elected in coming weeks from Colorado and Wyoming aren't required to back a specific candidate, nor are 54 of Pennsylvania's 71 delegates.On the Democratic side, even a solid win Tuesday in Wisconsin by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wouldn't do much to erase Hillary Clinton's delegate lead. The state has 86 pledged delegates at stake. Because Democrats award all delegates on a proportional basis, Mrs. Clinton is bound to come away with a respectable number whatever the Wisconsin outcome. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates 1,243 to 980. With so-called superdelegates thrown in, her lead grows to 1,712 to 1,011. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination.Mr. Sanders is showing no sign that he is prepared to give up. Powered by small donations from loyal donors, he is raising more money than Mrs. Clinton, giving him the means to stay in the race as long as he wishes. In March, he outraised Mrs. Clinton by nearly $15 million.Messers. Cruz and Trump barnstormed Wisconsin Monday, each saying they are the only candidate who can defeat Mrs. Clinton in the general election. Mr. Cruz, at a cheese shop in Kenosha, said Wisconsin Republicans ""realize that Donald screams and yells a lot, but he has no solutions.""Mr. Trump, who is running second to Mr. Cruz in state polling, lamented the coordinated attacks against him from the state's GOP establishment.""We're winning by almost 300 delegates,"" Mr. Trump told a crowd in Milwaukee Monday night. ""I think we close it out before the convention.""Regardless of the Wisconsin results, Mr. Trump can't clinch the GOP nomination beforeJune 7, when California and four other states -- Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota -- complete the party's nominating calendar.For Mr. Cruz, there almost certainly aren't enough bound delegates left for him to reach 1,237 before delegates gather in Cleveland, even if he were to sweep the 42 at stake Tuesday in Wisconsin. To win a first-ballot vote, the Texas senator would have to run the table in remaining states, win the allegiance of unbound delegates and take supportfrom others now attached to candidates who have suspended their campaigns. Some of those suspended-candidate delegates will be free agents on the convention's first ballot, others in subsequent votes.With 17 states left to award bound delegates in primaries, Mr. Trump has 737 delegates. Mr. Cruz has 475 delegates and would need more than all of remaining bound delegates to reach 1,237, though his campaign believes his total is higher because of private commitments made by unbound delegates and delegates now tied to candidates with suspended campaigns.Ohio Gov. John Kasich has 143 delegates and can't become the standard-bearer unless the convention requires multiple ballots to choose a nominee.A Wisconsin win would be a signature victory for Mr. Cruz, who hasn't won a primary state since March 1 victories in Texas and Oklahoma. But the coming states on the calendar -- April 19 in New York and a week later in five northeastern states -- all appear to be friendlier terrain for Mr. Trump.Mr. Cruz told reporters in Wisconsin that he remains hopeful he'll be the party's nominee heading into the convention but also predicted he would win if it takes multiple ballots to choose a nominee. ""In that situation, I think we will be in a very, very strong position,"" Mr. Cruz said Saturday in Ashwaubenon.The Trump campaign in recent weeks has sharpened its focus on delegates after being outmaneuvered by the Cruz campaign in Louisiana to gain the support of more delegates.Mr. Trump's top delegate strategist, Ed Brookover, said that to get to 1,237, Mr. Trump doesn't need to win any from the unbound states or Wisconsin, where recent polls suggest he is likely to lose most of the state's delegates to Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich. ""For our projections to get to 1,237, we had zero for Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota and Wisconsin,"" he said. ""Cruz has to sweep Wisconsin to stop us, and the idea that Mr. Trump is not going to make a first-ballot victory is a fantasy.""Mr. Brookover said the Trump campaign is counting on winning 85 to 89 of the 95 New York delegates, sweeping victories in other northeastern states voting April 26 and at least two-thirds of the 172 delegates from California. He also said Mr. Trump needs no delegates from Nebraska, Montana and South Dakota to win the nomination on the first ballot.Mr. Cruz's campaign disputed Mr. Brookover's forecast as wildly optimistic on Mr. Trump's chances in the Northeast and California. ""Evidently the Trump delegate team are all graduates of a Trump University math program,"" said Cruz spokesman Ron Nehring.As long as Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich remain in the race, Mr. Trump's delegate ceiling is limited. Rhode Island, Oregon, Washington state and New Mexico will all divide their delegates proportionally.In New York, 81 delegates will be awarded proportionally in the state's 27 congressional districts, though a candidate can take all three from a district if he reaches a 50% threshold. The state's other 14 delegates will be distributed proportionally according to the statewide vote, with a similar winner-take-all threshold. ""All I have to do is win, because if I get 50% lots of good things happen, right?"" Mr. Trump told the West Allis crowd Sunday.In Colorado, Republicans have begun selecting delegates at congressional district conventions. Mr. Cruz's supporters won all three slots at the state's first congressional district conventionSaturday. The state's other congressional districts select their delegates later this week.In West Virginia, 31 of the state's 34 convention delegates will be elected on May 10.The biggest unbound prize comes April 26 in Pennsylvania. Delegates will appear on the ballot separately from the presidential candidates, and voters won't know the allegiances of the delegate candidates.Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason said in a recent interview that he will seek to have the state's unbound delegates vote together for a single candidate to improve the state's clout at the convention, though elected delegates won't be compelled to follow his lead.---Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

JaeckelNew YorkToday's GOP is letting tactics dictate its strategy rather than using strategy to define its tactics. Until that changes, the Republican Party will be unable to create a national majority.Mark VennerDallasAssuming no viable third-party candidate comes forth, conservatives should spend all their time and resources in an effort to retain Republican control of the House and Senate.

I find this hysterical. Donald Trump didn't need House Speaker Paul Ryan in the primaries and certainly doesn't need him now. Mr. Ryan is part of the establishment which has had its chance, and we have seen its incompetence. Trump voters want to finish off the establishment and turn this country around.Gary NicholsAtlanta---The problem with Speaker Ryan and the conservatives in the Republican Party is cowardice. Mr. Barnes emphasizes the dilemma of the conservative members of Congress. He says that Mr. Ryan ""considers himself a 'movement' conservative."" Yet the ""movement"" is going nowhere. It couldn't even nominate a Republican conservative as its candidate for president.What Mr. Ryan and his conservative Republicans need to do is take a page out of Great Britain's playbook and form a political party specifically named after its beliefs: the ""Conservative Party."" Then it should name Paul Ryan its first presidential candidate. This would demonstrate the conservatives' courage and eliminate the confusion. If Mr. Ryan really believes in conservative values, the timing couldn't be better.John R. ByersScarsdale, N.Y.",5/18/16

By adding another stage of litigation, Tuesday's decision could spare Mr. Trump a potential campaign disruption of a trial where he could be called to testify.Related Coverage* Trump University Fraud Suit to Go to Trial, Judge Rules (April 26, 2016)* Trump University Staff Detail How School Changed Course (April 11)* Woman Suing Trump University Can Back Out of Case, Judge Says (March 23)* Trump Could Be Called as Witness in Trial Over Real-Estate School (March 18)* Trump University Fraud Suit Can Proceed, Appeals Court Rules (March 2)It could take a year or more for the New York State Court of Appeals to review key legal questions underpinning the state attorney general's case against Trump University.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's civil lawsuit, which was filed in 2013, alleges that Trump University exploited the billionaire businessman's celebrity status to lure people to enroll in pricey seminars on real-estate investing that failed to deliver on their promises. It claims that Trump University lacked proper licensing and defrauded thousands of students out of thousands of dollars each.Trump University, later rebranded the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, stopped accepting students in 2010, according to court documents.A separate and pending class-action suit in California against Mr. Trump, filed in 2010 by former students, also alleges that Trump University defrauded students. A trial date for that case has been set for shortly after the presidential election.Mr. Trump has denied the allegations in the suits, saying Trump University students got their money's worth. He has accused Mr. Schneiderman of ""gross incompetence"" and of ""wasting millions in taxpayer money"" on what he called a politically motivated probe.A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Jeffrey L. Goldman, said he was ""extremely pleased"" to be given a chance to fight the lawsuit at the higher court.In the New York case, Mr. Goldman is challenging an earlier ruling that reinstated a fraud claim on jurisdictional and procedural grounds. A victory at the Court of Appeals wouldn't end the case but could limit the damages and blunt its political impact.""It's no surprise that Donald Trump is using every legal option to avoid standing trial for allegedly operating a sham for-profit university,"" Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement.A spokesman for the Court of Appeals said it typically takes a year for the court to hear arguments and issue an opinion after a case is added to its docket.Mr. Schneiderman could ask the Court of Appeals to move the case ahead of the line, but such requests are rarely made and granted, the spokesman said.A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said no decision has been made on whether to seek an expedited review.Write to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.comCredit: By Jacob Gershman",5/18/16

Election 2016: Trump Would Block Funds Sent to Mexico,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778650828?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he would demand Mexico pay between $5 billion and $10 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and if the payment weren't made, he would block remittances from undocumented Mexicans living in the U.S.He pushed the tough-on-immigration plan -- which has won him support in the past -- as he faced a difficult primary in Wisconsin on Tuesday. Mr. Trump billed the proposal as an ""easy decision for Mexico: Make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year."" To carry it out, Mr. Trump would need to change parts of the Patriot Act to restrict undocumented immigrants' ability to send remittances to their home countries via wire transfers.If Mexico makes the payment, the memo says, remittances would keep arriving. The U.S. government estimates remittances to Mexico totaled $24.8 billion last year; just how much was sent by undocumented workers is unclear.The plan, contained in a two-page memo sent to the Washington Post, sparked sharp criticism from President Barack Obama, who called it ""impractical"" and ""half-baked."" ""The notion that we're going to track every Western Union bit of money that's being sent to Mexico, good luck with that,"" he said in remarks at the White House.Mr. Obama also said the plan would hurt the Mexican economy, suggesting that if it were to collapse, more immigrants would come to the U.S. ""because they can't find jobs back in Mexico."" He added: ""This is just one more example of something that is not thought through and is primarily put forward for political consumption.""For recipients in Mexico, it was personal. The Trump plan ""would hurt the well-being of the family that receives the remittances,"" said Elvira Azpeitia Fuentes, a teacher in central Hidalgo state whose family receives money from a relative in the U.S. and uses it to run a small hotel. ""If he [Trump] uses that money, it wouldn't make sense for them to be sending it. It's being used to develop a small business in the future that will allow us to live easier.""Michelle Buckalew, a spokeswoman for MoneyGram International, said, ""Many of our customers depend on our services to pay for basic needs like education, housing and health care."" The Dallas-based money transfer company is the second-largest sender of remittances to Mexico with a 14% market share.Under the Patriot Act, banks, savings associations, credit unions and certain other financial institutions are required to follow customer-identification procedures when a customer opens a new account. Wire-transfer companies, like Western Union and MoneyGram, aren't included, because customers don't need to set up a formal banking relationship.Mr. Trump's proposal would reclassify all money transfers as an ""account,"" meaning customers would provide identification and their immigration status. The proposal would be a broad expansion of financial regulatory law, extending banking regulations to a new industry sector.Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and cabinet officials have repeatedly rejected the idea of a border wall, or that Mexico would pay for it.""Under no circumstances is Mexico going to pay for the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing,"" Finance Minister Luis Videgaray said last month in a television interview. ""To build a wall between Mexico and the U.S. is a terrible idea. It's an idea based on ignorance and has no grounding in the reality of the integration of North America.""---Rachel Louise Ensign and Anthony Harrup contributed to this article.Credit: By Gabriel T.

Wisconsin Trump Stop,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778650820?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's defeat in Wisconsin on Tuesday marks a major turn in the Republican race for President that now may not be settled until the July convention in Cleveland. With a chance to make his nomination all but inevitable, Mr. Trump was rejected by a majority of the Badger State's engaged and well-informed GOP voters.Ted Cruz won the state as the party's establishment rallied behind him, including Governor Scott Walker and his political operation. Badger State talk-radio hosts also opposed Mr. Trump, in contrast to national radio talkers who are more populists than they are reform conservatives. The exit polls also showed that Wisconsin voters aren't as angry as GOP voters elsewhere in the country, perhaps because they've seen what a united reform movement can accomplish in their state.Mr. Trump also hurt himself with a string of mistakes and uninformed statements that have caused millions of GOP voters to have second thoughts. His standing among women in particular has fallen to lows unheard of for a potential major party nominee -- upwards of 75% negative. This raises doubts about whether he has any chance even against a candidate as flawed as Hillary Clinton, and whether he might cost the GOP its Senate and House majorities.Mr. Trump's core support -- a third to 40% of GOP voters -- remains loyal, and he is still the front-runner. But Wisconsin shows that the same blunt, polarizing style that thrills his supporters alienates most Republicans. His campaign is now saying Mr. Trump will shift to giving more serious policy speeches to look more presidential, but the businessman has never shown he has the discipline to carry that out. Maybe this defeat will get his attention.Mr. Cruz says his victory shows he is the only alternative to Mr. Trump, but that will be tested later this month in the New England and mid-Atlantic states where he hasn't done well. The Texan is second in the delegate race but neither he nor John Kasich can reach a 1,237 delegate majority before the convention. The best outcome for Republicans now is that no one gets 1,237 before the convention, leaving it to the delegates to choose a nominee who looks like he might actually be able to win the election.",5/19/16
"Election 2016: Trump, Clinton Seek Home-State Boost",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778650793?accountid=12768,"Presidential front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will turn their attention to New York this week, where they lead in polls and hope to use their home-state advantage after encountering bumpy stretches in a long race.Mrs. Clinton has struggled to fend off Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, losing a string of states recently, and expects the April 19 primary in New York to give her a firewall as she seeks to clinch the Democratic nomination.Mr. Trump's path to the Republican nomination has hit a difficult patch recently amid his controversial comments on abortion and national security and his campaign manager's being charged with battery. A victory in his home state would give him a significant boost in his efforts to avoid a contested GOP convention.In an interview, the businessman said he would travel widely upstate, where there are serious economic problems that he described as ""very sad."" Mr. Trump said he plans to talk about terrorism, citing the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, and take aim at rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for criticizing him for having ""New York values.""""I can't imagine any New Yorker wanting to vote for Cruz,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He doesn't like New Yorkers. He was mocking New Yorkers.""Aides to Mr. Cruz didn't return requests for comment.Last month in New York, Mr. Cruz previewed his arguments against Mr. Trump, saying New Yorkers would be reluctant to back the real-estate mogul because they know him better than the rest of the country does.The senator noted that Mr. Trump gave campaign donations to a number of prominent New York Democrats, including Mrs. Clinton and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. ""So the next time you think of all the disastrous policies that have been foisted on the people of New York, you can thank Donald Trump for bankrolling those efforts,"" Mr. Cruz said.Mr. Trump defended the donations, saying he gave to ""everyone"" as a businessman.Among likely GOP voters in New York, Mr. Trump leads with 56%, while Mr. Cruz is at 20% and Ohio. Gov John Kasich at 19%, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.Other than California, New York has the most delegates up for grabs in the remaining contests. The GOP gives away 95 delegates, while the Democrats award 291.Ahead of Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates by 1,243 to 980. A total of 2,383 is needed to clinch the nomination. Mr. Trump had 737 delegates, Mr. Cruz had 475, and Mr. Kasich 143, with 1,237 needed to win.The primaries this year have given New York, usually an afterthought in the nominating contests, a rare turn in the spotlight. Locals have joked about Mr. Kasich's choice to eat pizza with a fork while in New York City and about Mr. Sanders's saying city subway riders used tokens to pay, a long-abandoned method.Mr. Cruz invoked former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to ban large sugary drinks -- Mr. Cruz was against it -- while praising police officers who turned their backs on the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, during a dispute more than a year ago.The city's Democratic politicians, meanwhile, have publicly criticized Messrs. Trump and Cruz for their views on immigration and social issues.The GOP candidates are likely to spend much of their time upstate, which contributes about 52% of the state's GOP registration, according to Bruce Gyory, a political consultant in New York. Republicans upstate vote far more frequently in GOP primaries than those in other parts of the state, he said.Mr. Trump is likely to do better in the state's western portion but have more difficulties in the New York City suburbs, Mr. Gyory and other observers said, citing the struggling economy and more antiestablishment views there.Among likely Democratic voters, Mrs. Clinton holds a 54% to 42% lead, according to the Quinnipiac poll. So far, in New York City she has campaigned in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator, is expected to mobilize labor unions and downstate Democrats, who have widely endorsed her, to fend off Mr. Sanders, who has played up his Brooklyn roots and support from the Working Families Party. Mr. Gyory said New York City is likely to contribute 50% to 55% of the primary vote.Mr. Sanders needs to show he can dent Mrs. Clinton's support among black and Latino voters, who dominate the New York Democratic primary, said Bill Hyers, who managed Mr. de Blasio's 2013 mayoral campaign.The Vermont senator will do well upstate, Mr. Hyers predicted, where liberal Democrat Zephyr Teachout performed better among white liberals than Mr. Cuomo in the last gubernatorial election.Credit: By Josh Dawsey",5/19/16
"Trump, We Knew Ye",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778650591?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump never wanted it enough.Though some will think it premature to write his presidential obituary while the Wisconsin results have yet to come in (thanks to our deadline) and while the GOP nomination contest is far from decided, in fact the obituary is overdue.Hillary Clinton and her donors are fully committed and probably have been since 2000. A presidential race is all-or-nothing. You either win or you don't. And you don't get your money back.Mr. Trump has not been all-in. The most obvious way is with his unwillingness to put up the money, though many overlooked his hesitance because he was doing so well with free media coverage.The money was significant of something larger: his unwillingness to work out the whole path to the presidency, and his lack of 100% commitment to do the things necessary to succeed. Control his mouth. Recruit credible advisers. Produce a thoughtful policy program. Though it received surprisingly little commentary, his insistence on using his primary-victory rallies to flog his golf courses, product lines and related business interests.There were signs to be read. The smarter half of his already-committed voters were looking, after Michigan, for him to show he could expand his coalition and fill out the image of a president. He didn't.Athletes, in postgame victory interviews, frequently say, ""Our guys wanted it more."" The guy whose preferred epithet is ""loser,"" who defines himself as life's ultimate winner, failed this test. It's hard to know exactly why. Maybe winning is only winning if he does it his way, refusing to meet expectations, including the media's demand that he fill out an acceptable picture of a president-in-waiting.He certainly was willing for voters to award him the office by acclamation, without having to risk his fortune or submit to the usual indignities. But only a wild surrender to unrealism about our political system explains why so many sophisticated observers became willing to read his limited, early successes as heralding a candidate who could go all the way.His presidential campaign began as a lark and, despite his primary wins, remained one. He was never serious in the Hillary sense. He has been fingering his get-out option since he got in. If you didn't see it, it's because you forgot what a presidential race really is.Let's talk about the convention. Mr. Trump is all but certain now to show up without enough delegates to clinch the nomination -- which, in his case, means his race is over.He offers his remaining fans a claim that somehow he is entitled to the nomination as long as he can boast the most delegates, never mind that the rules specify a majority of half-plus-one.Many state and local elections do, of course, award office to whichever candidate attracts one more vote than the second-highest vote-getter. But that's because, in our two-party system, much of the winnowing and consensus-seeking takes place within the parties, in primaries and caucuses, in the competition for donations and endorsements, before a candidate is ever presented to the general electorate.That's exactly what's going on in the GOP nomination contest. Delegates to the convention are empowered to finish the job if voters in the primaries don't. And primary voters have pretty much missed their opportunity to do so barring some unexpected landslide for Mr. Trump or Ted Cruz in the remaining primaries.And this is perfectly right. Polls strongly suggest that Mr. Trump is opposed by more Republicans than support him. He would likely lose a straight-up, one-on-one nomination fight against several of the GOP candidates who've already dropped out of the race. He would lose to Hillary Clinton in the fall, polls suggest, and John Kasich would win.Mr. Trump hints at riots if he is denied the nomination. This is a joke. He has little or no organization at the state and local level. He only now has hired a professional canvasser to reach out to delegates. Though some conventioneers may also be Trump fans in their hearts, all delegates will be GOP lifers picked by their state parties. These aren't people who would walk out or sabotage a convention for Mr. Trump's sake.He might try calling on his rank-and-file voters to converge on Cleveland and mount street protests. He won't. He does not want criminal liability. He doesn't want his Trump brand associated with hooliganism and tear gas. Most of all, he would be humiliated in the likely event that only his skinhead admirers show up.The big irony of the Republican race, of course, is that Ted Cruz is a minority taste in the GOP as well. Here resides another testament to the convention designers' wisdom. After the first ballot, delegates will be free to skip over Mr. Cruz and seek a nominee who isn't just the handiest non-Trump, but who can command broad support from the Republican Party and the U.S. electorate.Credit: By Holman W.

"Trump, Sanders and the Populist Anti-Policy Surge; Washington 'experts' stir many Americans' loathing. Time to put the public back into public policy.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789890763?accountid=12768,"If there's one thing that unites the populist campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it's a desire to put the ""public"" back into ""public policy."" Many Americans apparently feel that policy is something done to them, rather than with them. They disdain the unknown ""experts"" in distant Washington, D.C., who devise everything from trade deals to overtime rules.As the dean of a graduate school in public policy, I've been thinking: Are programs like mine partly responsible for this state of affairs? How should graduates in the Class of 2016 react as they enter a world increasingly skeptical of their expertise?It's true that government has often failed to engage citizens. During a recent conference on land use at Pepperdine, the planning director of a large California city explained it this way: ""The problem is that we always put people up in front of the public who are the least prepared to be there.""Her staff were experts in the technical aspects of their work--from limits on building heights to requirements for setbacks. But she recognized that when her planners met with citizens, who often had different priorities, they were incapable of facilitating productive dialogue. The public simply concluded that the government couldn't--or wouldn't--""listen.""Graduate programs in public policy and public administration have wrestled with this for years. The discipline sends into the field alumni who may be very good at formulating something called ""policy,"" but not so good at understanding the public's role in its creation. ""Large segments of mainstream public administration scholarship,"" Robert F. Durant and Susannah Bruns Ali wrote three years ago in Public Administration Review, ""privilege bureaucratic expertise and marginalize the deliberative role of unorganized interests and citizens in agency deliberations.""The general tendencies of these academic programs toward quantitative knowledge and standardized solutions has created what we see today: from local planners who don't listen, to White House advisers who believe that ObamaCare passed because of the ""stupidity of the American voter.""At Pepperdine, we host a training series titled ""Public Engagement: The Vital Leadership Skill."" More than 1,000 public officials have taken part, learning the basics of facilitating input from citizens. We developed the program about five years ago after realizing that many midcareer public leaders never learned these skills in college and graduate school.Are this generation's successors being taught them? The retirement of the baby boomers will effect one of the greatest changes in public leadership in American history. Now is the time to update these programs to ensure that generational change becomes cultural change.First, we should teach students to think of the public not as a faceless mass, but as actual, individual human beings. ""Modern public administration,"" the great sociologist Robert Nisbet wrote, ""has been generally dominated by the nineteenth-century rationalist's conception of society as a vast aggregate of unconnected political particles."" That was in 1953.Public-policy programs should integrate essential quantitative coursework into a liberal-arts approach. Students should read what the Great Books say about the role of a citizen in a democracy, while studying what the latest social-psychology research shows about the myriad biases people bring to ""fact based"" decision-making. These will help them see that the policy they develop for Rome, Ga., may not work in Rome, N.Y., (or Rome, Italy, for that matter) and that some government services might be better provided by a local nonprofit or through collaboration with the private sector.Second, schools must teach a set of skills--how to facilitate public meetings or publicize them to increase participation. The ""public comment"" process by which local boards and councils usually involve citizens does not succeed at informing either the public or policy makers. In 2013 Pepperdine, working with the League of California Cities, surveyed over 900 public officials . Seventy-six percent said that their public meetings were ""typically dominated by people with narrow agendas.""It's the same phenomenon that played out in the conflagrations known as town halls when ObamaCare was being passed. Citizens came out in force against the bill, but Congress passed it anyway. Some argue that these failed public meetings led to the creation of America's last populist movement: the tea party.Finally, students of public policy should be taught about the role of technology in mediating the relationship between the citizen and his government. A couple of months ago, my hometown of Santa Monica invited me via Facebook to complete an online survey regarding a downtown building project. Tomorrow's public leaders must be prepared to involve and inform residents in ways the private sector has employed for decades--engaging them on social media, or posting budget data online to increase transparency.In the months ahead, thousands of future leaders will be awarded degrees in public policy. Meanwhile, graduate schools should ponder the role they play in American democracy--and how they can respond to the populist moment that is upending politics (and policy) as usual.Mr. Peterson is the dean of the Pepperdine School of Public Policy.Credit: By Pete Peterson",5/20/16
Obama Front-Runs Trump on China; The new 522% steel tariff will hurt U.S. companies. Worse may be coming.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789808778?accountid=12768,"The Obama Administration may not sound like Donald Trump when talking about trade with China, but it isn't above using protectionism for political gain. On Tuesday the U.S. Commerce Department increased a tariff on ""dumped"" Chinese cold-rolled steel to 522%, a move that will hurt American manufacturers who need the steel to remain competitive.The tariff might score some populist points with voters in an election year. It also may be a ploy to get lawmakers to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement before President Obama leaves office. But past experience suggests that such gambits inflame protectionist sentiment rather than tamp it down.President George W. Bush imposed tariffs of up to 30% on a broad range of Chinese steel products in 2002. The Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition says the tariffs cost the U.S. economy 200,000 jobs and $4 billion in lost wages. The Obama Administration made a similar mistake in 2009, slapping ""safeguard"" tariffs on Chinese tires. Punitive tariffs on a range of other Chinese products followed, and Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs and cases at the World Trade Organization. Both sides are now in violation of WTO decisions that followed these tit-for-tat taxes.Beijing's trade record is marred by export rebates and discrimination against foreign companies. Government policy in various forms is behind the quadrupling of Chinese-steel capacity since 2000, whether through cheap credit to build new mills or the wave of public construction projects after the 2008 financial panic. China now produces about half of the world's steel, and as its own demand has subsided the excess has flooded the world market, driving down prices.But this is good news for the U.S. Since steel is an important raw material for many industries, China's trade partners benefit from its wasteful policies. Lower prices make companies that use steel more competitive and bring down prices for consumers.Daniel Pearson of the Cato Institute conservatively estimates that American companies using steel produce $990 billion in value added, more than 16 times the output of the U.S. steel industry, and also employ 16 times more workers. If tariffs on Chinese imports raise the U.S. price of steel, these companies' costs will be higher than foreign competitors', hurting their ability to grow and provide more jobs for Americans.U.S. steel makers and unions argue for high tariffs on the basis that steel users will buy American. But manufacturers complain that the U.S. mills don't produce the same range of products as the Chinese. So some will simply have to pay the tariff-inflated prices and endure the competitive damage.The steel tariff is a warm-up for the fight over granting China market-economy status in December. Beijing's 2001 accession to the WTO included a 15-year adjustment in which China was treated as a nonmarket economy for purposes of antidumping investigations.The U.S. and EU have been able to use input prices from other developing companies to estimate Chinese producers' cost of production. This lowered the evidentiary bar and resulted in high tariffs such as those on cold-rolled steel. Antidumping cases are dubious even without this statistical legerdemain, and U.S. unions and companies will lobby the next President to renege on the WTO accord.The larger question is whether the steel tariffs herald a new and more bitter era of trade retaliation. Previous skirmishes have been damaging but stopped short of full escalation. But Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton have run for President as protectionists, and Mr. Obama's surrender to steel interests is a bad omen. Chinese officials who think they can keep flooding the world with surplus goods could be in for as rude an awakening as U.S. consumers.",5/20/16
Election 2016: Trump Effect Is on Display In Texas Race --- Republican in heavily Latino district tries to distance himself from his party's front-runner,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779827981?accountid=12768,"EL PASO, Texas -- Republican Rep. Will Hurd, whose district snakes along the Mexican border, thinks there are better ways to prevent undocumented immigrants from crossing into the U.S. than constructing a wall like the one Donald Trump wants to erect.""Building a wall from sea to shining sea is not the silver bullet,"" Mr. Hurd said. ""Besides, that's the most expensive way, and least effective way, to do border security.""Mr. Trump's presidential candidacy has been marked by often-incendiary remarks on topics that include border security and the dangers posed by various ethnic groups. In announcing his candidacy last summer, for example, the New York billionaire claimed some Mexican migrants were drug dealers and rapists.But while Mr. Trump's hard-line positions and from-the-gut style have helped catapult him to the top of the GOP presidential field, they pose risks for down-ballot Republicans, particularly those running in communities with a higher share of minorities, college graduates or higher-income voters. That is especially true for Mr. Hurd, whose district is 67% Latino and 17% foreign-born, according to census data.David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report, recently downgraded Republicans' chances of holding six of their seats and upgraded prospects for Democrats in holding four of theirs, citing the likelihood that Mr. Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would be the GOP presidential nominee.At this point, Mr. Wasserman doubts Democrats will win the 30 seats needed to retake the House in the fall, but he said Mr. Trump, in particular, could alienate large chunks of more-educated and higher-income voters and motivate minorities to come out against him, particularly Latinos.""Trump at least gives Democrats some signs of life,"" Mr. Wasserman said.Democrats, of course, are doing everything in their power to make many of these races referendums on the Republican front-runner by trying to force their opponents to take sides in his frequent controversies.""Trump is deeply unpopular in the Latino community,"" said New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Mr. Hurd and other Republicans in similar positions are trying to distinguish themselves from the front-runner.""I've been talking to voters since before I got elected,"" Mr. Hurd said in an interview. ""People are not going to associate me with the comments of anybody else up ballot because I'm building independent relationships with them.""Building those relationships -- and surviving a potential big year for Democrats -- is harder than it sounds in a district that stretches from the San Antonio suburbs to the outskirts of El Paso.The race was always going to be a fight. The seat has changed hands in each of the past four elections. This year's matchup pits Mr. Hurd against former Rep. Pete Gallego, a Democrat beat by just 2,422 votes in 2014.Two years ago, Mr. Hurd spent much of the campaign trying to tether Mr. Gallego to the president. This year, Mr. Gallego is using a similar tactic against Mr. Hurd, challenging him to denounce Mr. Trump and trying to tie him to GOP leaders in Washington.""He's essentially cowering in the corner,"" Mr. Gallego said, of Mr. Hurd's reluctance to say whether he would vote for Mr. Trump in the fall. ""He can't seem to make up his mind.""Mr. Hurd still ducks the question, saying, ""We've got to see how these races pan out.""The 38-year-old first-term congressman, one of two black Republicans in the House, comes across as far less ideological than some of his GOP colleagues. He pitches himself as a politician more interested in delivering for the district than observing partisan purity.""I don't need to get into an ideological battle with someone, just to get into an ideological battle,"" Mr. Hurd said.Few issues in the district provoke more discussion, or opposing viewpoints, than border security.Mr. Hurd wants the federal government to empower local officials to have a greater say in how they police the border, which could mean a wall in more urban settings.""You cannot have a one-size-fits-all solution,"" he said.At an event in Fabens, Mr. Hurd encouraged a crowd of mostly migrant farmworkers, many with small children in tow, to reach out to his office if they have any problems with Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. An aide, translating in Spanish, added immigration.The shared heritage between Mexicans and Americans in this corner of West Texas was on display in late March when Mr. Hurd organized a forum to discuss securing a special United Nations designation for the region's centuries-old Spanish missions. A member of the county council suggested the stakeholders reach out to Mexican officials to help make their case, drawing agreement from much of the room. As the group discussed the next steps in the process, Mr. Hurd issued a gentle reminder to the roomful of mostly Democrats.""You need to make sure the current officeholders stay in office,"" he said, flashing a big grin.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",5/24/16
What His Believers See in Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771387880?accountid=12768,"Orlando, Fla. -- It's a warm, sunny Saturday afternoon. More than 10,000 people have gathered here at the University of Central Florida's CFE Arena -- one mother and her high-school son had driven five hours Friday evening -- to hear Donald Trump speechify.The crowd, a sea of red, white and blue, waves placards that say ""The Silent Majority Stands with Donald Trump."" Many have donned ""Make America Great Again"" trucker caps and ""Trump 2016"" T-shirts. At a bazaar outside, vendors hawk unofficial Trump merchandise, such as shirts with the candidate's face superimposed on Superman.The depth and range of Mr. Trump's support has been reflected in polls and election exit surveys, which generally show him leading the Republican field among voters of all ages, and all levels of education and income. In Mr. Trump, many GOP primary voters have found a sort of messiah -- or false prophet if you ask his opponents -- who promises to restore American leadership and strength in the world.""The country is a mess, and he's the only one who can help us,"" says Susan Muchacho, a retired woman who attended the rally with her brother. Kori Duval, an African-American mother of two who recalls the Reagan and both Bush presidencies fondly, shares similar sentiments: ""He will make America a country that other countries will look to again for support.""The Trump disciples I encounter aren't angry so much as they are agitated by what they perceive to be America's fall from greatness. They complain about the country's slow-growing economy, aimless leaders, lawless government and uncontrolled southwestern border. And they sincerely believe that only Mr. Trump can fix these problems. The irony is that they seem to demonstrate more conviction and resolution than the mercurial Mr. Trump.By 10:30 Saturday morning, thousands had already lined up for blocks around the arena. The rally had been scheduled to begin at noon, but it was postponed to 2:30 after Mr. Trump abruptly canceled a Saturday morning appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference to campaign in Kansas. Even so, Mr. Trump arrived nearly another hour late.During the long prelude, Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" and the Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" repeatedly played. A prayer was said asking God for ""divine intervention"" in the election and to give Mr. Trump ""the wisdom of Solomon.""A laid-off Disney employee spoke about having to train foreign workers, purportedly hired on H-1B visas, to replace her. (During Thursday's Fox News debate, Mr. Trump repudiated his earlier opposition to high-skilled immigration -- and then repudiated his new position an hour later.)Trump adviser Stephen Miller lambasted Marco Rubio's immigration bill, saying it would have allowed ""12 million illegal immigrants to take jobs from every single working American in this country"" and given ""amnesty to drunk drivers, sex offenders, gang members, criminal aliens.""By the time Mr. Trump finally took the stage, the crowd was restless. He received a rock-star welcome, which was fitting since his speech was a remix of his debate lines and news conferences, delivered in a faux-folksy manner. ""The last thing that you people are going to take is having a lightweight like Marco Rubio"" or ""lyin' Ted Cruz or some kind of politician in charge of this country,"" he inveighed. At one point, he slipped, saying ""we gonna protect our Second Amendment, me more than anyone else up here."" No one else was on stage.There were dog whistles intended to bait the barbarians and bigots whom he ostensibly believes are among his supporters. For example: ""We have a terrible president who happens to be African-American."" There were very few blacks and Hispanics in the crowd. Mr. Trump's critics sometimes deride his fans, which has the effect of alienating them. But Mr. Trump's invective evinces his own contemptuous opinion of his ""base.""The speech was repeatedly interrupted by muted protesters who, after being flagged by the crowd, were hauled out by security. ""He's lucky it's not 10 years ago. Ten years ago it'd be a different situation for him,"" Mr. Trump said of one, before launching into a discussion of waterboarding and torture.Many supporters claim to be energized by his bombast. ""Trump says what people are thinking,"" explains Bill Montgomery, a money manager, who believes the country needs some tough love. ""No pain, no gain."" But there are also plenty who back Mr. Trump in spite of his provocative rhetoric. ""Personally, he wouldn't be a friend of mine,"" says John Young of Melbourne, Fla., ""but I work with a lot of people I don't like.""Most aren't swayed by attacks on Mr. Trump's business record, such as his bankruptcies and the allegations of fraud at Trump University. His opponents are ""grasping at straws to try to find something against him,"" says Jennifer Howland of Indian Harbour Beach. Many even view his business failures as a testament to his resilience. As Mr. Young sees it, ""Sometimes you're going to fail. That's life.""According to rational choice theory -- a model used to explain economic behavior and outcomes -- people make logical decisions that optimize their interests after considering the costs and benefits. This may help explain voting behavior: Trump supporters seem to consider his pugnacity a positive attribute and view the other Republican candidates as inferior.They want a fighter who won't sugarcoat the truth or accept America's slide toward mediocrity. Yet Mr. Trump has avoided discussing perhaps the U.S.'s biggest long-term problem: exploding entitlement spending. Neither Mr. Rubio nor Ted Cruz, despite presenting more detailed policies, projects the frustration that Trump voters feel. Therefore, they're perceived to not ""get it.""While Trump supporters seem to be motivated by genuine patriotism -- a real desire to make America great -- it's hard not to detect an underlying strain of religiosity to the campaign. At the end of the rally, Mr. Trump asks his followers to take an oath swearing to vote for him in Florida's primary on March 15. ""This isn't a campaign,"" asserts Regina Reifinger of Palm Coast. ""It's a movement."" Whatever you want to call it, these people are true believers.---Ms. Finley is an editorial writer for the Journal.Credit: By Allysia Finley",5/24/16
Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Why Trump Backers Look Past Contradictions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771109293?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is a man of huge contradictions.He regularly decries that the U.S. has accumulated a national debt of $19 trillion, yet has proposed a tax cut and associated economic ideas that the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates would add between $11.7 trillion and $15.1 trillion to the debt over the next decade.He calls journalists -- and this is a direct quote from a rally in Florida over the weekend -- ""the most dishonest people on earth. . .disgusting, dishonest human beings."" Yet he is conducting a campaign that is built around the free media coverage their organizations provide.He promises to smash Islamic State fighters harder than anyone else, yet evinces little interest in putting American troops into Syria to do it -- the kind of position that prompted 117 former Republican national-security officials to declare in an open letter opposing his nomination that he ""swings from isolationism to military adventurism within the space of one sentence.""Yet none of this seems to matter to his many fervent supporters. Why?Two reasons. First, the Trump army supports him because of his attitude rather than his agenda. They take him at his word on the big stuff: He'll stop illegal immigration, he'll trash old trade deals and negotiate great new ones, he will stop American companies from moving overseas by pressuring them.It's more important that he says he will repeal Obamacare than have a detailed plan for replacing it.In short, goals matter more than any mechanism to achieve them. And since it's been a decade or so in which few of those detailed, 10-point plans that other politicians offer have gotten enacted in Washington, voters probably don't take policy papers seriously. Dysfunction in Washington is Mr. Trump's friend; the politicians who now curse his rise have created the gridlock that enables him.The second reason is that Mr. Trump makes clear that everything is negotiable anyway. His policy proposals, to the extent they exist, are opening bids rather than a set of immovable principles.""Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point,"" he said in the most recent Republican debate, in Detroit last week. Later he added: ""There's always give and take. There's always negotiation.""So Mr. Trump gets away with saying things that simply can't be taken at face value. One example: He seems to suggest at his rallies that the recently concluded deal with Iran over its nuclear program would somehow require the U.S. to pay Iran $150 billion. In the Florida rally over the weekend, he said he would tell Iran, ""We don't have $150 billion"" for you.Yet that impression is simply false. To the extent Iran will reap a financial windfall from the deal -- and it's probably less than $150 billion -- it will be from the return of Iran's own assets and proceeds from oil sales that have been frozen in international accounts abroad. It isn't U.S. money.At some point, though, a candidate moving closer to a presidential nomination will be taken at his word, as Mr. Trump found in that Detroit debate last week when Fox News moderators called him on the gap between his condemnations of federal debt and his economic ideas that seem destined to add to it.That problem is worth a closer look. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget attempted to pull together the few economic-policy proposals Mr. Trump has laid out -- a giant tax cut, immigration enforcement and expanding health care for veterans -- to see what effect they would have on the budget.The center says its best estimate is that Mr. Trump's tax plan would reduce federal revenues by between $9.5 trillion and $11.9 trillion over a decade. Add in the higher cost for veterans' benefits and higher interest costs, and the broader plan would reduce government receipts by $11.7 trillion to $15.1 trillion over 10 years.Mr. Trump says spending cuts, eliminating waste and spurring higher growth would make up the difference. But he also says he would protect Social Security benefits. To balance the budget on those terms would require cutting all other federal spending -- including on Medicare -- by 55% to 65%. Add on the cost of Mr. Trump's pledge to strengthen the military, and ""it becomes literally impossible to balance the budget with only spending cuts,"" the center says.Could Mr. Trump generate enough economic growth to make up the difference? The center estimates it would require annual economic growth of 7.7% to 9% just to avoid adding to the debt, and 10.4% to 11.4% to balance the budget in a decade -- twice as high as the fastest growth period in the past six decades.That would be a huge achievement indeed.Credit: By Gerald F.

Trump's Crumbling Wall Plan,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779827978?accountid=12768,"For a guy who brags incessantly about his business acumen, Donald Trump doesn't seem to know how capital markets work. If he did he never would have sent a memo to the Washington Post detailing a crackpot plan to force Mexico to pay for a Berlin Wall separating our two nations by threatening to block remittances. Even the humblest Mexican farmworker knows that's not going to work.The remittance blunder is a reminder that Mr. Trump is far better at issuing ultimatums than crafting thoughtful policy that will advance U.S. interests. For all of his bluster and braggadocio, he comes off to most of the world like a spoiled child in short pants shouting orders at the help.If voter surveys are correct, Trump supporters are largely native-born and economically aggrieved. As such, they are susceptible to ultranationalist attacks on foreign countries. Mexico is the perfect whipping boy.The centerpiece of the Trump campaign is his silly claim that he can restore America's lost economic mojo by more tightly controlling immigration and adopting a protectionist trade policy. Nothing excites Trump supporters at rallies more than when he promises that Mexico will pay for his big, tall, ""beautiful wall"" on the southern U.S. border.Mexico's political class rarely unites on anything, but there is unanimity that Mr. Trump will have to look elsewhere to finance his continental partition. In February former President Vicente Fox captured the popular sentiment when he used a vulgar adjective to describe Mr. Trump's wall.Mexican defiance apparently sent Team Trump into the bunker to craft an offer that Mexico could not refuse. The resulting memo presents a number of options ""to compel Mexico to pay for the wall,"" among them the threat to block remittances by rewriting provisions of the Patriot Act from the Oval Office.When Mexico got wind of this, the memo explains, it would cry uncle and hand over the money for the wall. ""It's an easy decision for Mexico. Make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year,"" the memo states.This document would not exist had Mr. Trump not believed that it reflects his brilliant management and negotiating skills. But if you're smarter than a third-grader, you can see that it is unlikely to yield the intended results. Instead, expect there to be unintended consequences, like greater criminality for one.As a matter of national pride neither the Mexican executive nor the Congress would entertain the idea of making this payment. They would have the broad backing of the Mexican people who widely object to Mr. Trump's characterization of their compatriots living in the U.S. as rapists and drug dealers.If Mexico refused to pay, under the Trump plan the U.S. government would invoke the revised Patriot Act to begin prohibiting aliens in the U.S. from wiring money unless they could prove that they are in the country legally.A rewrite of the Patriot Act is the prerogative of Congress and an attempt by the executive to do it would be challenged in court and probably ruled illegal. But even if it were not, it is absurd to think that it will stop the flow of dollars to Mexico.The most obvious way around the new provision would be for those who can prove legal residency to send the money for those who cannot. But wire transfers are only one way of moving money. It could also be deposited in a U.S. bank and withdrawn from automatic teller machines in Mexico by intended recipients.The only way Mr. Trump might inhibit the flow of dollars to Mexico via the formal banking system would be to impose targeted capital controls. But that's likely to violate U.S. obligations under a variety of international agreements.It would also place a huge burden on Americans and the American economy. More than one million gringos live in Mexico and another 20 million visit the country every year. Plus, Mexico is America's third largest trading partner and U.S. manufacturing is highly integrated with Mexico. Capital controls would blow up a production-sharing relationship that has made the North American economy the envy of the world.Not all migrant workers have access to bank accounts, so even without capital controls the Trump plan would be a jobs program for organized crime. Cartels already specialize in bringing profits from U.S. drug consumption across the border to Mexico. They would no doubt be happy to offer their delivery services to new customers.Team Trump wants the world to know that there is more in its bag of tricks than the remittance squeeze. The memo floats the idea of new trade tariffs and making it more difficult and expensive for Mexicans to secure visas.Call it the art of the shakedown.

""We want to send that message that we are going to fight every day.""Both candidates are working hard for the 475 delegates at stake in the June 7 primary in California. There are also contests in five other states, and barring a total collapse, Mrs. Clinton is likely to capture enough delegates that night to claim the presidential nomination, possibly before the polls close in the Golden State.Confident in her position, Mrs. Clinton declined to participate in a final debate and she ignored questions about a State Department report released Wednesday that found her private email system violated agency policies.But a new poll released Wednesday by the Public Policy Institute of California found the candidates in a statistical tie, with 46% of likely Democratic primary voters and 44% preferring Mr. Sanders. Earlier polling had Mrs. Clinton ahead.Her campaign said late Wednesday that it would start airing TV ads in three markets, a ""six-figure"" buy and a proposition her campaign had hoped to avoid. It also appears to be running an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation. It has nine field offices, and an aide said phone banks in seven languages and door-to-door visits have been under way for two weeks.Mrs. Clinton has also pressed her advantage with party leaders. Elected officials at every level, union leaders, women's rights activists and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, all have headlined events. On Wednesday, she was introduced by actress Jamie Lee Curtis.The state should set up well for Mrs. Clinton. She easily won the 2008 primary. That year, nearly half the electorate was nonwhite, and she has done well with minority voters this year.At rallies, Mrs. Clinton doesn't even mention Mr. Sanders, focusing instead on the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump. On Wednesday in Buena Vista, she said the money he wants to spend on a border wall with Mexico could pay for 16 Golden Gate Bridges or 1,500 new elementary schools. She also hit him for comments ahead of the housing crisis that appeared to be rooting for prices to fall, saying he could make a lot of money.""A good result in Donald Trump's world is he gets his and you get hurt,"" she said.But even as Mrs. Clinton looks to the fall, many of her backers remain uneasy with Mr. Sanders's continued presence in the race.""He should just stop,"" Conni Lira, 70 years old, of Pico Rivera, who saw Mrs. Clinton at a union organizing event Tuesday. ""He's just making it more difficult for her when he doesn't have a chance.""Mr. Sanders isn't going away. He has 17 rallies planned or completed over an 11-day stretch. He projects he will have spoken to 200,000 people by June 7. He has four field offices and 80 paid workers.Mr. Sanders has already spent about a half-million dollars on satellite-TV ads, which can be carefully targeted, according to tracking by Kantar Media CMAG. The campaign says it has bought $1.5 million on its new buy.Mr. Sanders released a new TV ad this week that urges voters to think beyond the nomination contest itself to what has become a broader effort to transform the Democratic Party. The unspoken message is that a Sanders vote isn't wasted, even if he can't win.""What choice do Californians have in this election?"" Mr. Sanders asks in the ad. ""The biggest one of all: You have the power to choose a new direction for the Democratic Party.""As Mr. Sanders campaigned in recent days in liberal strongholds of California, he drew crowds of thousands; his supporters treat him like a rock star, chanting his name.At a rally in San Jose, supporters stood for hours in a dusty state fairground to hear the hoarse-voiced candidate speak. He mixed in mentions of local issues, such as one likely to be on the California ballot this fall.""If I lived in California, I would vote 'yes' to legalize marijuana,'' he said, drawing loud cheers from the mostly young audience.He has also endorsed a California ballot initiative designed to control prescription-drug prices by restricting the amount state agencies could pay for them.His campaign also has been bumpy. Some staff have recently departed, and his last finance report showed the campaign running short of money.But he has built a grass-roots operation aimed at tapping into the enthusiasm that runs strong for him and his cause. That includes a Bay Area campaign headquarters in Oakland, a storefront where three dozen people were working on phone banks one recent weekday morning.They were focusing heavily on voter registration, working up against a deadline just four days away for voters to change their party registration and become eligible to participate in the Democratic primary.Iris Safar of Modesto was among the volunteers. A 36-year old yoga instructor, Ms. Safar said the only time she has voted in a presidential race was in 2000 when she voted for Ralph Nader's third-party bid.""I'd never marched, never protested, never been involved in anything political,'' Ms. Safar said. ""When I go to a Bernie event, I'm with a group of people that have a higher level of consciousness. You are with kindred spirits.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.comCredit: By Laura Meckler And Janet Hook",5/26/16

"Trump, Cosby and the Clintons; The day the Bills came due.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791094523?accountid=12768,"No doubt it was just a Freudian slip. The Washington Free Beacon reports:MSNBC host Steve Kornacki confused former President Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby on Tuesday while talking about Cosby's appearance in a court in Norristown, Pennsylvania over sexual assault allegations.""We're going to begin with that breaking news we told you about at the top,"" Kornacki said. ""Right now out of Pennsylvania, Bill Clinton is set to arrive at a suburban--excuse me, Bill Cosby is set to arrive at a suburban Philadelphia courthouse any moment now for a key hearing in his criminal sex assault case.""But then get a load of this headline, from a piece by Salon's Mary Williams : ""It's Not Just Bill Cosby: It Takes a Village to Exploit Women--and to Keep It All Quiet."" Although Williams never mentions the Clintons by name, ""It Takes a Village"" is almost too obvious an allusion to have been subliminal.As it happens, your humble columnist was in the studio at MSNBC, waiting to go on the air with Kornacki, when he made that slip, which escaped our notice at the time. MSNBC.com describes our segment as follows: ""Democratic strategist Emily Tisch Sussman shares her reaction to Donald Trump's latest dig at the Clintons. She says he will say anything and is guided by 'misogyny, racism and self-enrichment.' James Taranto of the Wall Street Journal also joins the discussion.""You can watch the clip and judge for yourself whether that summary does it justice. Here we'll just point out, as we did on MSNBC, that Sussman offered essentially the same defense of Mr. Clinton that Cosby's lawyers, according to MSNBC correspondent Ari Melber, are putting forth for their client, to wit: Bill C. is an elderly man, and it is unfair to hold him to account for things he did a long time ago.We arrived at 30 Rockefeller Center early and spent some time in the green room watching ""Morning Joe,"" which featured a panel of pundits pooh-poohing Trump for raising questions about the Clintons' history. He was damaging his candidacy, they insisted, by bringing up crazy conspiracy theories, such as that the Clintons killed deputy White House counsel Vince Foster. Our thought was that if this was what they were talking about on MSNBC, Mrs. Clinton was probably not having a good day.Foster's death in 1993 was in fact a suicide. ""But it is fair game to talk about Foster's relationship to the Clintons,"" argues the Weekly Standard's Mark Hemingway :Initially, Foster worked with Hillary Clinton at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, where he was instrumental in making her the firm's first female partner. Among the other notable things he did at the firm, Foster and Webb Hubbell, with Hillary Clinton's approval, brought in a bunch of women alleged to have had sexual relationships with Bill Clinton and offered to represent them when a political opponent threatened to expose the affairs. The goal was to intimidate and silence the women, and it appears to have worked. Gail Sheehy reports that Hillary Clinton herself sat in at least one of the meetings with the women. (Hillary Clinton would later tell Sheehy in 1992 to look into unproven accusations of infidelity against George H.W. Bush.)It takes a village, all right.As Vox's Dylan Matthews reports, Broaddrick makes a similar claim about Mrs. Clinton:About six months after her initial interviews in 1999, Broaddrick told the Drudge Report that mere weeks after the alleged assault, Hillary Clinton had tried to thank her for her silence on the matter at a political rally:""[Hillary] came directly to me as soon as she hit the door. I had been there only a few minutes, I only wanted to make an appearance and leave. She caught me and took my hand and said 'I am so happy to meet you. I want you to know that we appreciate everything you do for Bill.' I started to turn away and she held onto my hand and reiterated her phrase--looking less friendly and repeated her statement--'Everything you do for Bill.' I said nothing. She wasn't letting me get away until she made her point. She talked low, the smile faded on the second thank you. I just released her hand from mine and left the gathering.""This wasn't included in the initial reports on Broaddrick's story by the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New York Times, and NBC News. But after this article's initial publication, Lisa Myers, who conducted NBC News' initial report on Broaddrick, wrote Vox to clarify that Broaddrick did tell NBC that Hillary Clinton had an encounter with her after the alleged assault, though this did not make the final cut of the Dateline segment.Trump is challenging the false media narrative that Mr. Clinton was just high-spirited and Mrs. Clinton the passive victim of what are variously called her husband's ""alleged infidelities ,"" ""marital indiscretions ,"" ""past peccadilloes "" and--our favorite--""what he did with his penis ."" In doing so, he is revealing many in the media to be little more than palace guards for the Clintons.A Saturday Washington Examiner headline summed the matter up succinctly: ""Media in Agony as Trump Makes It Relive Clinton Sex Scandals."" The Examiner's T. Becket Adams reviews the media reactions after Trump, in an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity, ""used the word 'rape' "" in reference to Broaddrick's accusation of rape:Over at NBC News, Andrea Mitchell characterized Broaddrick's story--that then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton raped her in a hotel room in 1978--as ""discredited and long-denied.""ABC News's Tom Llamas took Mitchell's lead and reported this week that the rape charge is ""decades-old and discredited.""However, the former NBC investigative reporter who first interviewed the alleged victim in the late 1990s sees things a bit differently.""Nothing has come up since that story was reported that in any way undercuts what Juanita Broaddrick said,"" Lisa Myers said in a 2014 C-SPAN interview.Early yesterday Trump released an Instagram ad featuring audio of Broaddrick's interview with Myers and a still photo of Mr. Clinton smoking a cigar. It's far from subtle, but the timing--just before Cosby's preliminary hearing--was a stroke of either luck or genius.Supporters of Mrs. Clinton take comfort in the 1990s' denouement, in which Mr. Clinton, charged by Congress with perjury and obstruction of justice, skated; the public supported him; and Mrs. Clinton parlayed her role as victimized wife into a U.S. Senate seat. They expect history to repeat, but it may not.For one thing, Mr. Clinton's wrongful acts may be old news to voters of middle age and older, but it is new to the under-30 generation, which has not been supportive of Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primaries.For another, the Democrats won in the 1990s by cleverly flipping the script, making criticism of Mr. Clinton's misconduct more unrespectable than the misconduct itself. They did so in substantial part by depicting Mr. Clinton's adversaries as prudes and hypocrites engaged in what the New York Times's Amy Chozick just yesterday called a ""Javert-like pursuit"" of poor Bill.Donald Trump doesn't care about respectability. And accusations of prudishness and hypocrisy won't stick to him. He has many faults, but those are not among them.Fox Butterfield, Is That You?

Democratic Fictions About the GOP and Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771387902?accountid=12768,"The prospect of Republicans nominating Donald Trump for president has the party of Lincoln and Reagan teetering on the edge of the abyss. Democrats are enjoying the spectacle, but that doesn't mean they should be allowed to revise history.The conventional wisdom on the left is that the GOP brought the Trump phenomenon on itself. For years, insists the New York Times, Republican leaders have embraced and exploited ""the darkest elements of the party's base."" The Washington Post adds that the party ""has subtly and not so subtly played on racial resentment."" Other liberal pundits have cited the tea party movement as evidence of supposedly ascendant GOP white nationalism. Republican leaders, in other words, have greased the skids for this New York vulgarian and now want to feign shock at his success.The tea party charge might be the most absurd, and not just because the movement abetted the election of racial and ethnic minorities such as Tim Scott, Nikki Haley and Marco Rubio. Liberals who are eager to ascribe racial motivations to the tea party are ignoring activists' pre-Obama anger at George W. Bush's spending policies.In truth, the GOP leadership has made concerted efforts in recent years to expand the party's appeal to nonwhites. More can and should be tried, but the notion that the GOP has been waiting and hoping for a Trump figure to lead the way is an MSNBC fantasy. Mr. Trump's commanding lead in the polls can be attributed primarily to his celebrity status and strong support among economically anxious working-class voters who don't trust professional politicians.In 2002, after Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi lauded Strom Thurmond's 1948 Dixiecrat presidential bid, President Bush condemned the statements before a group of black ministers in downtown Philadelphia and then helped orchestrate Mr. Lott's ouster from his leadership post. In 2006 Mr. Bush addressed the NAACP's annual convention and spoke openly about his party's racial history. As head of the Republican National Committee (RNC) from 2005 to 2007, Ken Mehlman spoke to more than 50 black audiences nationwide, including the major civil-rights organizations. He acknowledged that in the past the party had tried ""to benefit politically from racial polarization"" and that ""we were wrong."" In 2009 Michael Steele became the first black chairman of the RNC.This is rather odd behavior for a party playing to the darkest elements of its base. So is the fact that the Republican presidential nominee was John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 -- hardly the first choices of immigration hard-liners. Mr. McCain denounced the birthers, and Mr. Romney refused to make an issue of Mr. Obama's controversial pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Both men acted in the interest of racial comity, and if they hadn't, charges of racism surely would have ensued. That those charges ensued anyway says something about the left's heads-I-win-tails-you-lose racial politics.After Mr. Romney's defeat in 2012, the RNC released a 100-page assessment of its missteps and outlined a strategy for moving forward. ""The Republican Party must focus its efforts to earn new supporters and voters in the following demographic communities: Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islanders, African-Americans, Indian Americans, Native Americans, women, and youth,"" the report said. ""The pervasive mentality of writing off blocks of states or demographic votes for the Republican Party must be completely forgotten. The Republican Party must compete on every playing field.""Donald Trump is not the answer to the GOP's problems. He was not part of their future plans. He wasn't really invited to this party. He crashed it. And judging from the primary election results so far -- he's winning pluralities, not majorities -- most Republicans want him to leave. Democrats and their friends in the media are much more eager for Mr. Trump to be the face of the GOP than are Republicans, even if liberal pundits are pretending otherwise.Today, it is the Democratic Party that stands to gain the most politically from racial and ethnic division. And no one knows this better than the Obama administration. The president counts Al Sharpton as an adviser; has dispatched Vice President Joe Biden to tell black audiences that conservatives want to put them ""back in chains""; and used his attorney general to stir up the Democratic base by claiming that Republicans are trying to disenfranchise black voters.Most people who follow politics assumed that Mr. Trump would fade eventually if he didn't implode first. The window is closing but it's still a possibility.A new ABC News/Washington Post polls finds that just 42% to 45% of voters who lean Republican ""call Trump honest and trustworthy, say he understands their problems, think he has the right personality and temperament, or say he has the right experience to be president."" Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio score much higher on those attributes, from 50% to 64%. Mr. Trump's lead is shrinking. The more voters learn about him, the less they seem to like.---Mr. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Journal contributor, is the author of ""Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed"" (Encounter Books, 2014).Credit: By Jason L.

"Trump, Voters and the GOP Convention",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771109381?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump may pile up more than enough delegates in the primaries to make his GOP presidential nomination this summer a formality. But what if he doesn't? Mr. Trump, Ted Cruz and their media mouthpieces are claiming it would be political theft to choose the nominee at a contested convention. These timid souls need an education in party rules, political history and muscular democracy.The Republican Party's rules say a candidate needs the votes of 1,237 of the 2,472 delegates at the July convention in Cleveland to win the nomination. They don't say all one needs is a plurality, or to have won the most primaries. There is no moral right to the nomination because a candidate wins 40%, or even 49%, of the delegates. He needs a majority, and the 1,237 number is no secret.Parties set this public requirement because they exist to win elections, and a nominating majority is the best indicator of the rough consensus necessary to unite the party behind the winner. A candidate who can't put together a majority of delegates is unlikely to unite the party and is probably a loser in November.Before the primary system became the norm in the decades after World War II, party nominees were always chosen at the convention. But even in the primary era, a convention fight has been possible.As recently as 1976, Gerald Ford came into the convention with more delegates than Ronald Reagan, who offered the vice presidency to Senator Richard Schweiker to turn the Pennsylvania delegation his way. The influential Drew Lewis chose to honor his pledge to Ford, kept the Pennsylvania delegation in line, and denied Reagan the nomination.Democrats had to go three rounds of balloting in 1952 to produce Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson as their nominee. In 1956 Democrats staged a floor flight over which of more than a dozen candidates to nominate for vice president. Estes Kefauver won. And in 1980 there was a short-lived effort at the Democratic convention to change the rules to help Ted Kennedy catch Jimmy Carter, who had lost nearly every late primary to the Massachusetts Senator.With this history in mind, each party continues to have rules for how long delegates are pledged to a candidate. Under the GOP rules, about 1,700 delegates out of 2,472 (69%) are bound in the first ballot to vote for the candidate for whom they are pledged -- usually by a primary or caucus result. The 31% who are unbound come from states that don't hold binding presidential preference contests, or from states that allow some of their delegates to remain uncommitted.If the first ballot doesn't produce a majority, nearly 80% of the delegates then become free to vote for the nominee of their choice on the second ballot. By the third ballot, 89.4% are free to choose. This gradual liberation is designed to prevent a stalemate and let the delegates work their will to coalesce eventually around the best nominee. This isn't cheating or ""stealing the nomination."" It's how the process is supposed to work.Ah, but aren't the delegates part of the ""establishment""? If by establishment you mean stalwart party members in the provinces, then yes. They are often the rank-and-file GOPers who run state and local party operations. But others are activists chosen to become delegates by the various candidates.It's true that three delegates from each state are Republican National Committee members. But the rules this year require nearly all of those RNC members to vote in the first ballot for the candidate who won the most at-large votes in a state primary or caucus. So those RNC members, a small minority of delegates, are expressing the will of the voters in the first go-round.The premature protests by Messrs Cruz and Trump are entirely self-serving. Both men think they have a good chance to win a plurality of delegates but can't be sure they'll get all the way to 1,237. They want to cry havoc in advance so party members will shrink in fear of a GOP breakup if there's a nominating fight at the convention.These candidates and Republicans generally should toughen up. If Messrs. Trump or Cruz couldn't sway a majority at the convention, it would be because they couldn't convince their fellow Republicans that they have the best chance of winning. Every candidate entered the race knowing the rules, and every candidate has an equal opportunity to exploit them. Mr. Trump certainly has used the accelerated primary calendar to his advantage, racking up a delegate lead before he's been subject to any real scrutiny.It's always possible that a losing Mr. Trump would bolt the GOP and run as a third-party candidate or urge his supporters to boycott in November. But the same might happen in reverse if Mr. Trump becomes the nominee despite what is growing opposition from traditional Republicans. If the businessman can't rally a majority at the convention, then he can't unite the GOP enough to beat Hillary Clinton.Many primaries have yet to be held, and the odds are that the voters will give one candidate a clear majority before Cleveland.

Main Street: Trump: A Bill Maher Republican,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771109346?accountid=12768,"Forget asking GOP consultants. Or the other candidates. For any Republican Party elder who is still scratching his head over the rise of Donald Trump, the man with the answer is comedian Bill Maher.The HBO host gave it on ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" last August when he summed up Mr. Trump's appeal to the electorate this way:""They are desperate to have somebody lead them,"" Mr. Maher explained. ""Somebody to say, 'You know what, I just don't bend to your bull----.' And Donald Trump, I've got to say, I don't agree with him on a lot, but I kind of get him. We've been doing the same thing.""Yes indeed. When Mr. Trump goes unfiltered -- boasting about his genitalia from the podium of a presidential debate -- it baffles polite society that such comments do not sink him the way they would mere mortal pols. Especially since his response when called on it almost always is to double down on the provocation, even when he's wrong.One explanation for the Trump phenomenon is that it proves the American people (or at least Republicans) are just what the Democrats say they are: an odd bunch of gun nuts, bitter clingers, homophobes, racists, sexists, Muslim haters and other assorted kooks. In this view, all Mr. Trump has done is bring the ugliness out into the open.The other explanation is a version of Mr. Maher's. Americans are tired of the pieties that prevent our leaders from addressing problems honestly. They see, for example, their president refusing to utter the words ""Islamist terror"" even after bloody terrorist rampages that leave Americans dead. These include the 2009 attack on Fort Hood, which was called ""workplace violence"" even though the killer -- Army Major Nidal Hasan -- had been in communications with an overseas al Qaeda leader and was shouting ""Allahu akbar!"" as he went about his murderous shooting spree.So when Mr. Trump vows to kill not just the terrorists but their wives and children too, it doesn't follow that this is what his supporters are in fact cheering on. More likely what they hear Mr. Trump saying is this: I am going to keep you safe, and I'm not going to let political correctness get in the way. At a time when two out of three Americans are telling pollsters that political correctness is a huge problem for our country, Mr. Trump is tapping into a powerful sentiment.Unfortunately, there are two kinds of political incorrectness, and Mr. Trump's is the inferior version.The better kind of political incorrectness challenges what George Orwell called ""the smelly little orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls."" It does so with reason and a willingness to go where the facts take it.This is the political incorrectness that is under siege today. Especially in the academy, and especially if the orthodoxy being challenged is a progressive one, the challenge often carries a high price for the challenger.Question the science behind global warming, for example, and you will be met with accusations you are a ""denier."" Hold the same views on marriage Barack Obama claimed to hold until very recently -- that it ought to be confined to one man and one woman -- and you will lose your job if you are the CEO of Mozilla. If you are African-American and you write about black crime and the crisis of fatherless families, you will be denounced as an ""Uncle Tom.""Mr. Trump's political incorrectness, by contrast, is rooted in outrage and coarseness. This is also Mr. Maher's specialty, along with the easy yuck. Thus his most recent show featured Trumplike subtitles (e.g., ""We're going to make Germany great again"") superimposed on a video of Hilter giving a fiery speech.A Republican as the Fuhrer. Amusing, yes. Brave, hardly.Into this world comes Mr. Trump, real-estate-mogul/reality-TV star. As the Good Book puts it, Never spake man like this man before. And a huge chunk of the American people find it refreshing.Here's the further complication: Even Maher-style political incorrectness, like Mr. Trump's, occasionally veers into a substantive point. Mr. Maher, for example, has done so in his warnings about the threat of radical Islam and a Democratic Party trying to pretend it doesn't exist.The Donald makes his own contributions here. Though no one (save possibly himself) would ever confuse Donald Trump with Francis of Assisi, at a time when the Obama administration wrings its hands about whether what's happening to Christians in Syria and Iraq is genocide, Mr. Trump speaks bluntly about our impotence in the face of ""people chopping the heads off Christians"" in the Middle East.Give Mr. Maher his due: Though he and Mr. Trump clearly play for different teams, they are playing the same game. No one should be surprised. When you suppress the healthy kind of political incorrectness, what you end up with are the insults and vulgarity of its bastard brother.In the entertainment world, it comes out as Bill Maher. In this year's presidential election, it's Donald Trump.Credit: By William McGurn",5/26/16
The Trump-Obama Corporate Tax Reform Fail,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770815004?accountid=12768,"Removing the incentive for American companies to move their headquarters abroad is a widely recognized goal. To do so, the U.S. will need to join the rest of the G-7 countries and tax business income only once, in the country where it was earned. Notably, this principle -- called territoriality -- is included in the bipartisan framework for international tax reform developed by Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) in 2015.Unfortunately, recent reform proposals have a serious flaw: a ""minimum tax"" on foreign business income. This flaw is in President Obama's fiscal 2017 budget, and Republican presidential front-runner, Donald Trump, has broached a similar idea on the campaign trail.Currently, the U.S. taxes the world-wide income of its corporations at one of the highest rates in the world, but defers that tax until the profits are repatriated. The result is the worst of all worlds -- a high federal statutory rate (35%) that encourages aggressive transfer pricing, a significant restriction on capital allocation that keeps cash offshore, very little revenue for the Treasury, and the loss of U.S. headquarters to countries with territorial tax systems.Major financing and investment patterns now reflect these distortions. A series of significant merger announcements are driven by the desire to get out from under the U.S. tax regime and to use offshore cash. The large debt offerings in our capital markets are efforts by companies to fund share repurchases and dividends because repatriation of their offshore cash would trigger punitive U.S. taxes.Tax reform is supposed to end these distortions, but a global minimum tax on foreign business earnings would undermine reform. The Obama administration's budget, for example, would end the deferral of taxes on unrepatriated cash and lower the statutory tax rate on corporate income to 28% (still higher than most other industrial nations). A U.S. company would still be able, as it can today, to take a credit on the taxes it already paid to another country. But if the taxes a U.S. company paid to another country were less than 19%, it would be slapped with an additional federal tax. The minimum-tax is dressed up by rhetoric that it will protect jobs at home and ensure that companies pay a ""fair share.""Mr. Trump has recommended a world-wide system without deferral and a much lower rate of 15%. As such, American firms earning profits abroad would still face home-country taxation and the Byzantine system of foreign tax credits that creates numerous tax planning opportunities.The flaw in both proposals? Corporate tax rates are declining around the world, amid continuing competition for firm headquarters and intellectual property. Ireland taxes most corporate profits at 12.5%. A global minimum tax means U.S. companies earning income abroad would still be subject to adverse U.S. taxes -- precisely the distortion that tax reform is supposed to end. Meanwhile, the disincentives to be a U.S.-headquartered multinational firm will persist.Japan in 2009 and the United Kingdom in 2010 shifted to a territorial tax regime and lowered their statutory corporate rates. The U.K. did so to stop companies from moving their headquarters abroad; Japan was primarily interested in encouraging its multinationals to reinvest foreign earnings at home. Neither country adopted a minimum tax when it switched to territoriality. And neither country experienced the predicted dire consequences -- such as dramatic tax revenue losses or job losses from outbound investment -- of a switch to territoriality without a minimum tax.In fact, no significant country with a territorial tax regime has a minimum tax on its companies' foreign earnings. In part, this decision reflects the considerable complexity that such a minimum tax would create, a complexity that will only serve the industry of tax planners.Ultimately, the proposal for a minimum tax is driven by unfounded fears that American multinational firms pose a risk to the American worker by not showing loyalty to America. This coarse intuition is both naive and wrong. It is naive to assume that U.S. policy makers can exert market power to limit the logic of global opportunities and imperatives. More important, it is mistaken to demonize the foreign operations of American multinationals as working contrary to the interests of American workers.Instead the evidence, including research by C. Fritz Foley, James R. Hines and myself, suggests that U.S. companies succeeding globally expand at home -- contradicting the zero-sum intuition. Demonizing multinational firms plays to populist impulses today. But ensuring that the U.S. is a great home for global companies and a great place for them to invest is actually the best prescription for rising median wages.Opportunities for corporate tax reform are infrequent. Including a global minimum tax would therefore be something the U.S. would have to live with for decades -- during which corporate tax rates will fall around the world and the minimum tax, as well as its distortions, would grow in importance.---Mr. Desai is a professor of finance at Harvard Business School and a professor of law at Harvard Law School.Credit: By Mihir A.

Donald Trump's Latin Role Models,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770814983?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump supporters believe that they've got a novel candidate whose ideas have never been tried. They might be disappointed to learn that Mr. Trump's political playbook is right out of 20th century Latin America. If he should become president, the country is likely to be about as successful as the region has been under this kind of leadership.As Latin America has learned the hard way over the last 100 years, capital goes, and stays, where there is a rule of law that treats it well. It's why the U.S. has developed and most of the rest of the hemisphere has been left behind.Mr. Trump believes the rule of law is for pansies. His fans adore him because he promises to override institutional inertia and simply decree whatever is on his mind, like a caudillo. This won't end well.If elected, Mr. Trump would inherit a country where the rule of law is already under attack by President Obama. Long-winded and ruling by decree whenever Congress -- the constitutionally coequal branch of government -- does not accommodate him, Mr. Obama is a classic Latin American demagogue.Conservatives despise the 44th president's refusal to acknowledge the pluralistic traditions of the republic and its constraints on the executive. Yet there was a time when the loyal opposition viewed this abuse of power as an anomaly, a blip in an otherwise institutionally robust nation.Now the Republican Party is host to another faction and it is asking for its own mano dura. Far from restoring respect for the Constitution, Mr. Trump is promising to be more Obama than Obama. His supporters are fine with that; it's their turn. Which is to say, we're becoming Bananalandia.The central plank of the Trump campaign is his pledge to violate the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, which was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by Bill Clinton in December 1993. Mr. Trump says he will slap a 35% tariff on cars and car parts from plants in Mexico as a way to bring manufacturing jobs to the U.S.To destroy Nafta lawfully, a President Trump would have to convince Congress to repeal the legislation that implemented it. That would be a heavy lift, given that the North American economy is highly integrated after two decades and billions of dollars of investment that interconnects all three economies. Hundreds of thousands of jobs now depend on free continental trade flows.It cannot be lost even on Mr. Trump that Congress is unlikely to blow up the U.S. economy in order to inflict harm on Mexico. So either he's blustering to get elected, or he plans to circumvent U.S. law by issuing a unilateral decree imposing the tariffs.Trump supporters are backing this promise of an unconstitutional use of executive power because they aim to raze the ""establishment."" But this is a dangerous game.It's too often easy to find an excuse, a moral outrage, to grant permission for the unconstitutional acts of a strongman. Venezuela -- which until Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999 was among the longest-running democracies in Latin America -- comes to mind. In 1998 oil prices were low, the economy was adrift, corruption was rampant, and the outsider Chavez promised to topple everything. He did. And once the law was destroyed, there was no way to control him.A half-century earlier another authoritarian populist, Juan Peron, had grabbed the mantle of Italy's Benito Mussolini and become the champion of Argentina's ""shirtless ones."" Peron undermined the rule of law so thoroughly that the rich nation of immigrants has yet to recover.Republican candidates generally agree about the economic malaise under Mr. Obama. But there is a huge rift about how to fix the problem. Mr. Trump, who ironically says he's a good negotiator, has a plan that relies heavily on breaking this country's commitments under international trade law.The U.S. is a signatory to numerous World Trade Organization agreements, which are designed to keep members from sliding into the protectionism of the 1930s. If Mr. Trump unilaterally decrees a new tariff on foreign-made goods, we're supposed to believe that U.S. trading partners will sit still. It's more likely that they would challenge his extralegal actions in court and the U.S. would lose. Meanwhile, Americans can expect trade wars that will hurt consumers and exporters.Mr. Trump's pledges that he is ready to abuse the power of the presidency does not end with economics. On Thursday night he said again (before backtracking) that the military will be forced to obey unlawful orders if he gives them.One more similarity between the candidate and every generalissimo who ever lived is his plan to find a way to sue public critics. Maybe he's been taking tips from Ecuadorean strongman Rafael Correa.Investors are unlikely to cooperate with a mercurial President Trump. There are other destinations for their capital.Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady",5/26/16
Trump a 'Unifier'? Not Quite,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1770175022?accountid=12768,"The Donald Trump that showed up at his Super Tuesday news conference was a different Donald Trump than we've seen before. We've witnessed angry Trump, flustered Trump, (at least once) gracious Trump, and exuberant Trump. This was presidential Trump. Kind of.The presidential bit was Mr. Trump's pivot toward the general election, and his promise that he is a ""unifier"" who is creating ""a much bigger party"" that can't be ""beat."" He then reverted to true Trump style to warn that if Republican power players succeeded in taking him out, they'd also take out his new loyalists, meaning the party would ""lose everything"" in November.Both claims are worthy of some analysis. GOP turnout, no question, is epic. More than 8.5 million people turned out for Republican races on Super Tuesday, a stunning 81% higher than the 4.7 million in 2012. (The other side, by contrast, saw turnout fall 32% from 2008, the last contested Democratic primary.) Vermont aside, every single Republican primary and caucus has drawn record numbers.Let's stipulate that Mr. Trump is behind some of this. Both surveys and anecdotal evidence show that he is pulling new people to the polls. Yet let's also stipulate that so, too, are the other Republican candidates. The reality is that a lot of Americans are rebelling against the Obama presidency. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich are inspiring their own droves.The best evidence for this is Texas, where 2.8 million souls voted in the GOP race on Tuesday -- nearly double 2012, and a 108% increase over 2008. Along with Nevada, that's the biggest jump in state turnout numbers so far. Yet the masses were coming out to give Mr. Cruz 44% of the vote. Mr. Trump limped in a distant second, with 27%. His 757,000 voters equaled far less than Mitt Romney claimed (more than one million) in 2012.Texas aside, five other Super Tuesday states posted GOP turnout of 50% more than ever before. Notably, four were states Mr. Trump either lost or nearly lost: Alaska, Minnesota, Arkansas and Virginia. (The fifth was Tennessee, where Mr. Trump had a clear victory). Oklahoma also had a record turnout, adding 20,000 new voters to the rolls since Jan. 15 alone. Mr. Cruz won that state, while Mr. Rubio tied Mr. Trump in state delegates.This raises the interesting question of whether Mr. Trump isn't driving two kinds of turnout -- his own, and the GBP NeverTrump crowd. Back in the Iowa contest, USA Today reported on Latino activists who went to caucus in Republican primaries, solely to cast a vote against Mr. Trump. (He lost that first contest.)Would both pro-Trump and anti-Trump voters stay home if he weren't the nominee? Possibly. The bigger concern for Mr. Trump is how many stay home if he is the nominee. The real-estate mogul loves to claim that people love him, but what he surely knows is that most of that love is emanating from a very small section of the electorate. To date, approximately 3.37 million Americans have cast a Trump vote. Yet an average 60 million people vote Republican in general elections, and overall 126 million people cast a presidential vote in 2012.He's certainly not unifying the broader country. According to a recent Gallup poll, nearly 60% of Americans view him unfavorably. (A recent CBS poll found that only 17% of Hispanics have a positive view of him.) Mr. Trump's overall unfavorable rating would be the highest Gallup has clocked, for any nominee, in any party, since it started tracking the question 25 years ago.Mr. Trump likes to claim he beats Hillary Clinton in polls. In fact, in the Real Clear Politics database of 45 such polls, he loses in 38 of them, and ties in two others. Mr. Rubio, by contrast, has steadily gained ground on her, winning 15 of the last 20.This is why Mr. Trump is promising unity; he'd need extraordinary amounts of it to overcome general electorate hostility. And yet the party is not, in fact, unifying. He came nowhere near claiming a majority of delegates on Super Tuesday -- as Mitt Romney did in 2012. A CBS poll conducted this week found that 74% of non-Trump voters would not be satisfied were he the nominee. His favorable rating even within the GOP keeps dropping. Gallup's tracking had his net favorable rating among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents was down to 15 points at the end of February, half of what it was a month prior, and the lowest since tracking began in August.In 2008, Roberta McCain famously admitted that many Republicans would vote for her son only while ""holding their nose."" Yet polls suggest party loyalty will not sway anti-Trumpkins. A Bloomberg survey of Southern Super Tuesday voters found that in a hypothetical between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, 27% of GOP voters would not go with their own nominee.Republicans roared into this race with a strong crop of conservatives, and a base eager to reclaim the White House. Mr. Trump is trying to claim he alone can inspire the unity and enthusiasm to win the GOP the White House. Don't believe it.---Write to kim@wsj.comLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint ServiceCredit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",5/26/16
Supreme Court Declines to Hear Union Appeal in Trump Taj Mahal Case; Lower-court rulings approved casino's move to unilaterally change the employment terms for workers,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792581873?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to take up a union appeal that challenged a move by the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City to scale back worker benefits as part of its bankruptcy reorganization.The court, without comment, left in place lower-court rulings that approved the casino's move to unilaterally change the employment terms for its workers, which included cuts to retirement and health-care benefits. A bankruptcy judge in 2014 said the casino was in dire financial shape and would have been forced to close without more favorable labor terms.While presidential candidate Donald Trump's name remains on the casino, he no longer owns it and hasn't been involved in managing it for years. The business now belongs to billionaire Carl Icahn, the secured lender who took over in bankruptcy.The union, Unite Here Local 54, argued that the casino's bankruptcy didn't give it the right to reject its duty under federal labor law to bargain with its workforce.A collective-bargaining agreement between the two sides expired shortly after the bankruptcy. Under federal labor law, key parts of an expired agreement remain in effect during new negotiations. But lower courts allowed the Taj Mahal to impose its own cutbacks, citing a section of the bankruptcy code that allows struggling employers under certain circumstances to reject previous labor terms.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comCredit: By Brent Kendall",5/31/16
Libertarians Pick Gary Johnson and William Weld as Presidential Election Ticket; Party hopes the two former GOP governors can mount formidable third-party assault on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792297878?accountid=12768,"ORLANDO, Fla.--The Libertarian National Convention on Sunday chose a pair of former Republican governors as their presidential and vice presidential nominees, putting forward the most-experienced election ticket in the party's four-decade history.Delegates gathered at a hotel here picked former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson as their presidential standard-bearer and backed Mr. Johnson's preference for former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld as the vice presidential nominee.By selecting a ticket composed of veteran Republican officeholders, Libertarians were hoping to present voters with a credible alternative to presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, both of whom are likely to enter the fall election as the most unpopular presidential candidates in history.Despite more than four decades on the national scene, the Libertarians haven't drawn more than 1% in a presidential election or elected anyone to federal office.With polls showing more Americans open to a third-party candidacy in the 2016 election than ever before, Libertarians say they hope to draw from a well of disaffected Republican, Democratic and independent voters. The party is also likely to be the only third-party option on the ballot in all 50 states this fall.Together, Messrs. Johnson and Weld have more than a dozen years of governing experience. Mr. Johnson was a popular two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, best known for his expansive use of the veto during his eight years in office and his support for the decriminalization of drugs. He ran for president in 2012 as a Republican before switching to the Libertarians, capturing the party's nomination and garnering nearly 1.3 million votes in the general election--the party's best showing yet.Mr. Weld was elected twice in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, governing as a moderate Republican with liberal views on abortion, gay rights and gun laws.""Fifty percent of Americans right now are registering themselves as independent, meaning new voters are registering themselves as independents.

Robots for Trump (and Clinton); The robotic revolution will upend society even more than the information revolution.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791480540?accountid=12768,"No matter what happens in November, one big winner has already emerged from the ruins of America's 2016 election: the robot. Both major candidates have embraced policies that will ensure the accelerating replacement of low-wage workers with no-wage workers.Under President Donald Trump, illegal immigrants and possibly even legal migrants will have a harder time finding work, meaning the businesses that now rely on their labor will turn to machines. Under President Hillary Clinton, a big increase in the minimum wage is certainly in the cards, in which case get used to ordering your Big Mac on a touch screen.At the same time, robotics is advancing technologically by leaps and bounds. Driverless cars are looking more and more like the future of the taxi industry, thus cutting off one of the typical routes to employment for immigrants. Truck-driving, meatpacking, fast-food preparation and hotel cleaning are ripe for automation as well.The robotics industry has so far concentrated on relatively high-end work--vehicle-assembly systems or medicine. But the combination of the minimum-wage hikes in cities and states dominated by Democrats and new pressures on immigrant workers will create a set of incentives for the world's robot-builders. They will begin to concentrate their efforts on building new categories of affordable and reliable machines to replace what used to be called entry-level jobs.Medical robots have rapidly improved over the last decade, and systems that assist surgeons in complex operations such as spinal fusion are now common. In the near future autonomous robots will be able to perform simple procedures such as biopsies at a fraction of the cost of a fully manned operating room. From there the possibilities are endless: The technology needed to replace a hotel maid or a fast-food chef should be relatively simple.Since 9/11, the U.S. military has poured billions of dollars into robotics research. The benefits from that investment are beginning to reach the civilian world. Robots that can walk on four or two legs have been built and tested, and although they have not yet been approved for use on the battlefield, no one in the military doubts that soon such systems will be widespread.The societal effects of this robotics revolution are likely to be less benign than the results of the information revolution, but just as unstoppable. Young people will find it even harder to find entry-level jobs. Will unemployable youth turn to drugs and crime, or will they simply waste away in their parents' basements playing videogames?One already troubled government program, Social Security, could be devastated by the robotics revolution. If ever-fewer human workers are paying into the system while larger and larger numbers of seniors are getting benefits, bankruptcy seems inevitable. Unless we can tax the robots?Mr. Dinerman writes on space policy and national security.Credit: By Taylor Dinerman",5/31/16

Then [they] use their success in real estate to pay off the banks in a couple of months or so,"" the playbook said.The declarations of former employees consistently assert that the university was more interested in turning a buck than in providing a meaningful educational experience.While ""Trump University claimed it wanted to help consumers make money in real estate, in fact Trump University was only interested in selling every person the most expensive seminars they possibly could,"" said Mr. Schnackenberg.Jason Nicholas, another witness for the plaintiffs who worked as a sales associate for five months in 2007, also said he was appalled by what went on at the university.""They were unqualified people posing as Donald Trump's 'right-hand men,' "" he wrote. ""They were teaching methods that were unethical, and they had had little to no experience flipping properties or doing real estate deals. It was a facade, a total lie.""In his sworn declaration, Mr. Schnackenberg he quit his job after refusing to pitch the seminars to a couple that he thought couldn't afford them.""They had no money to pay for the program but would have had to pay for the program using disability and taking out a loan based upon equity in his apartment."" He said another sales manager ""talked them into buying a $35,000 seminar.""In ordering the documents made public, Judge Curiel was responding to an April request by the Washington Post for the records to be unsealed.The same day the judge ordered the documents unsealed, Mr. Trump attacked him by name during a campaign rally in San Diego, accusing him of bias. ""I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curiel,"" Mr. Trump said Friday.""We're in front of a very hostile judge,"" Mr. Trump said. ""The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, federal judge. Frankly, he should recuse himself because he's given us ruling after ruling after ruling, negative, negative, negative.""His lawyers haven't filed any motions seeking to reassign the case to a different judge.The act of unsealing the documents by Judge Curiel didn't go entirely as planned. Judge Curiel admitted that he ""mistakenly"" unsealed certain documents that should not have been made public, including a declaration by one of Mr. Trump's lawyers. Late Tuesday, Judge Curiel ordered those documents again shielded from public view.Write to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.comCredit: By Jacob Gershman",6/2/16
The Not-Trump GOP Rises,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778926970?accountid=12768,"The Real Clear Politics average of Wisconsin polls (March 23-April 3) pointed to a close race, placing Ted Cruz ahead of Donald Trump by 39% to 35%. But the final week leading to Tuesday's primary was not kind to Mr. Trump, and he was crushed, 48% to 35%.Mr. Cruz's victory -- taking 36 of 42 delegates -- likely means no candidate will have the 1,237 delegates necessary for a first-ballot victory at the Republican convention in July. And the math between Mr. Trump and the party's nomination is treacherous.Mr. Trump now has more delegates -- 743 according to the Associated Press. But to reach a majority he must win nearly 60% of the 832 delegates yet to be selected. There are also more Not-Trump delegates, 897, than Trump delegates. Unless Mr. Trump lands in Cleveland only a few votes shy of a majority, it is hard to see backers of Mr. Cruz, John Kasich, Marco Rubio and uncommitted delegates supporting him on the second ballot.Even before the Wisconsin votes were counted, Mr. Cruz's people were spinning that their win would not result from Gov. Scott Walker's endorsement, advertising by anti-Trump super PACs, the concerted opposition of Wisconsin's leading conservative talk-radio hosts, and the character of the Badger State's GOP electorate.Instead, they credited their looming win to dumping the candidate's previous emphasis on social conservatism and pivoting to jobs, economic growth and opportunity. This, however, is likely more what Team Cruz managers want to do than how Mr. Cruz's rhetoric has been perceived.The next battle comes on April 19 in Mr. Trump's home turf of New York, and he is far ahead in the polls. The catch: Only 14 of the state's 95 delegates go to the overall victor. The rest are awarded in each of 27 congressional districts, two delegates for finishing first and one for second, provided each candidate gets at least 20% and no one gets 50%. If a candidate does get 50%, he gets all three district delegates.Can The Donald be held to less than 50% in most New York districts? And will the second-place finisher more often be Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich? They are nearly dead even in the Real Clear Politics average at 19% and 21.3% respectively. Yet even if Mr. Trump wins the lion's share of the state's delegates, the result will merely narrow the Not-Trump lead, not erase it.New York is followed a week later by Delaware (16 delegates, winner-take-all), Connecticut and Maryland (28 and 38 winner-take-all by congressional district respectively), Rhode Island (19 proportional, with delegates split among everyone who gets more than 10%), and enigmatic Pennsylvania, which awards 14 statewide delegates winner-take-all but selects 54 officially unbound congressional district delegates. This is all likely to leave the convention picture still murky at the end of the month, but with the Not-Trump forces in the lead.Mr. Trump's conduct is not helping his cause. The real-estate mogul is exhausted by the long campaign, spread too thin, surrounded by too few seasoned aides who stand up to him when his instincts are wrong, and unwilling to listen to sound advice from friends.Consider the Trump campaign's concession statement (there was no speech) Tuesday. It opened by declaring the contest's winner -- ""Lyin' Ted"" -- to be controlled by his donors and ""worse than a puppet -- he is a Trojan horse being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump."" It also made a baseless charge that Mr. Cruz violated federal law by coordinating his campaign with his super PAC.This was a pattern, not an aberration. When asked this week by the Washington Post's Robert Costa and Bob Woodward if it was time to begin uniting the GOP, Mr. Trump replied that bringing other Republicans ""into the fold"" was ""overrated."" He cares little about being endorsed by contenders who have dropped out, saying, ""I defeated those people,"" proving there was ""not a lot of talent"" there.Asked specifically about Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump replied, ""I don't need his support."" As to changing his tone, he said he didn't ""really have that much interest.""Credit Mr. Trump for candor. But these are shortsighted words from a petty man consumed by resentment and bitterness who finds satisfaction in sowing, rather than in healing, divisions. They showcase a man who does not understand what it takes to unite his party and win a general election. They explain, in large measure, why he lost in Wisconsin and, with his defeat, perhaps his chance to win the convention on the first ballot and therefore the nomination.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",6/2/16
"Election 2016: For Trump, Map Looks Better Than Math --- GOP front-runner puts focus on big prizes after scoring few of Wisconsin's delegates",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1778926933?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's loss in Wisconsin ensures the race for the Republican presidential nomination will stretch at least to the California primary on June 7, giving his detractors more time and terrain to force a rare convention fight.The map looks more favorable to the Republican front-runner moving forward, but the math doesn't. Mr. Trump needs to win 69% of the remaining bound delegates -- those committed to a specific candidate -- to clinch the nomination before party leaders gather in Cleveland in July.Even if Mr. Trump does well in the big Northeastern states that vote later this month, California -- and the four other states that vote the same day -- loom as Mr. Trump's last hope to amass the delegates he needs to avoid an unpredictable convention fight.The front-runner underscored the importance of California, where he leads in polls, by announcing Tuesday he would travel to the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, outside Los Angeles, for a news conference on Friday.Mr. Trump still owns a big delegate lead over the GOP field, with 743, according to the Associated Press, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 517 and Ohio Gov. John Kasich with 143. At this point, only Mr. Trump has a credible shot of winning the 1,237 delegates required to wrap things up before the convention, but he scored just six of Wisconsin's available 42 delegates on Tuesday.""Wisconsin tells us three things,"" said Brian Baker, one of the Republicans running Our Principles PAC, a group dedicated to preventing Mr. Trump from winning the nomination. ""No. 1, Trump can't close the deal. No. 2, Trump is not inevitable and there will be an open convention this July. And No. 3, Republicans do not want to waste their vote on someone who cannot beat [Democratic front-runner] Hillary Clinton.""Mr. Trump should get a boost when his home state of New York votes on April 19. The billionaire businessman is the top pick of 52% of likely Republican primary voters, according to a Monmouth University Poll released Wednesday. He also polls well in states such as New Jersey and Maryland that vote later in the month.""I see this as a turning point where things start to align for Donald Trump to lock this up,"" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Trump adviser who is the daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. ""By the end of April, it becomes mathematically impossible for Cruz to become the nominee.""The Texas senator, in third place in the Monmouth poll of New York, campaigned in the Bronx on Wednesday and was greeted by hecklers protesting his opposition to illegal immigration and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.It is highly unlikely that the forces that aligned against Mr. Trump in Wisconsin, including local activists and talk-radio hosts, will create such potent resistance to the front-runner in most of the states that have yet to vote. But they don't need to; if the ""Never Trump"" movement can replicate this success in just a few more battlegrounds, they will succeed in forcing a contested convention.From the beginning, the GOP nominating contest has been more about math than momentum. The crowded field and deeply divided electorate have made it harder than normal for any one candidate to amass delegates. The calendar made that task even more difficult, because more than half of the delegates were awarded before the field thinned to just three contenders.If the race does boil down to a hand-to-hand fight for delegates, the campaign of Mr. Cruz, who won Wisconsin and its remaining 36 delegates, has shown an ability to out-organize Team Trump. The Cruz camp displayed a mastery of process and tactics to win more delegates than Mr. Trump in Louisiana and North Dakota. The Texas senator also jumped to an early delegate lead in Colorado, one he can try to build on later this week.In the weeks ahead, anti-Trump groups will focus entirely on denying him the 494 delegates he needs to lock up the nomination, spending money where they think they have the best chance of denying the front-runner delegates. The political arm of the conservative Club for Growth, which spent $1 million against Mr. Trump in Wisconsin, signaled Tuesday that the group would spend money in Indiana and Maryland.Mr. Trump's loss Tuesday in Wisconsin also keeps the campaign of Mr. Kasich alive, despite trailing Mr. Trump by 600 delegates.""The nomination contest is now wide open,"" Kasich strategist John Weaver wrote in a memo to reporters Tuesday. Wisconsin results ""will solidify the fact that no candidate will reach Cleveland with 1,237 bound delegates,"" he wrote.---Josh Dawsey contributed to this article.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",6/2/16

Turns out, George was more correct than even he thought. Here we are almost a half-century later and George's son Mitt has destroyed his little remaining credibility with a principled attack on the presumptive 2016 Republican presidential nominee (""Romney's Lonely Challenge to Trump,"" page one, May 28). In the event that Donald Trump wins in November, we can only hope Mitt's misgivings aren't as prescient as his father's.Steve SlaterWaterford, Mich.---We owe Mitt Romney a debt for taking a courageous and unpopular stand against a man whose ravings may reveal a far more sinister worldview than many yet suspect. Donald Trump loudly denounces decent men and women, often on grounds having more to do with physical attributes or political fortunes than wisdom, courage or character. A man who divides his world into ""winners"" and ""losers"" is a character type that the world has seen before. At other times the labels variously were ""divinely favored and disfavored""; ""masters and slaves""; and ""Ubermenschen"" versus ""untermenschen."" My greatest fear is that Mr. Trump might not be a bully merely due to insecurity. He might believe he is right to bully the unfortunate because they deserve their misfortune.

"Election 2016: In House Race, GOP Challenger Hails Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780734358?accountid=12768,"ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Two years ago, a little-known Republican town supervisor almost unseated Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter, one of the lions of the New York congressional delegation, in the closest race she has faced since her first election to the House three decades ago.This year, the same GOP challenger, Mark Assini, thinks he may be able to win, even though Democratic turnout tends to be higher in a presidential-election year. His weapon, he believes, is Donald Trump, who has been drawing thousands of supporters across western New York, an economically distressed area that finds the GOP presidential front-runner's brand of populism appealing.Some Republican leaders have been anxious, and some Democrats gleeful, about the down-ballot effects of a Trump nomination, given the real-estate developer's high unfavorability ratings among many groups of voters. But in the white, working-class districts such as those that are typical in western New York, there is a different story, which even some Democrats acknowledge.In a re-election strategy meeting at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last month, at least one lawmaker cautioned against not taking Mr. Trump seriously, participants said.""With all due deference to you all, I think Donald Trump is going to be harder than you think,"" Rep. Debbie Dingell (D., Mich.) told some of her party's leaders at the meeting, according to people who heard her remarks.That perception is why Mr. Assini stood outside for hours Sunday in freezing temperatures to shake hands with the thousands of people lined up to see Mr. Trump speak at an airplane hangar outside of Rochester. Even in conversations with those constituents turned off by Mr. Trump, Mr. Assini explains why he would align with the businessman, whom he expects to be the party's nominee.""There are a bunch of things that I don't agree with him on,"" Mr. Assini said in an interview. ""But the one strength he has is his economic policy. We've had politicians try and they haven't done very well. Let's try a businessperson.""Ms. Slaughter declined to be interviewed for this article. Her aides pointed to a memo circulated by her campaign that describes Mr. Assini as a person with extreme views, citing, among other things, his support for Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump holds a commanding lead in polls ahead of next week's primaries in New York, and it is in his home state that his ability to help -- or hurt -- down-ballot Republicans will be most tested if he is the nominee. That is because New York is one of the few states where congressional districts weren't drawn for partisan advantage, so it has nine congressional races that are competitive or have the potential to be, according to the Cook Political Report.One of those nine districts is Ms. Slaughter's, which covers the Rochester region. President Barack Obama easily carried the district in 2012, and Ms. Slaughter won re-election by 14 points that year. But two GOP congressman in nearby districts have already endorsed Mr. Trump, including Rep. Chris Collins, who was the first member of Congress to do so.Mr. Trump's calls for a new approach to trade deals is resonating in a region beset by economic challenges. Eastman Kodak, the iconic Rochester photography company that employed 145,000 people world-wide at its peak, has just a fraction of its former workforce. General Motors Co. closed a plant in recent years. And last year, SentrySafe said it would move facilities from the Rochester area to Mexico and Wisconsin, eliminating hundreds of local jobs.""I'm the only one who knows how to stop it,"" Mr. Trump said Sunday in Rochester, using the safe maker to give a local flavor to his calls for slapping tariffs on imports to stop production from being shifted to other countries. ""I would have stopped them so fast your heads would spin.""Voters here find the clarity of such messages appealing, even if business and political leaders warn that Mr. Trump, if elected, risks touching off a trade war that could cripple the U.S. economy.""As far as me voting Republican, there's a very good chance that I will vote that way,"" said Darlene Dunn-Laffredo, a Democrat from Rochester who once worked at GM. Onboard a bus to Mr. Trump's rally, she says the GOP candidate has the ""right idea"" when he proposes steep tariffs on goods imported from low-cost countries.Credit: By Siobhan Hughes",6/6/16
Trump's New York Values,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780733261?accountid=12768,"The presidential primaries are in New York now, with it not beyond imagining that Donald of Trump Tower will sweep the state's 95 delegates Tuesday by winning all of its 27 congressional districts. If so, Ted Cruz can blame it and his possible third-place finish on that dumb remark about ""New York values.""He says it won him the Iowa caucuses. We're not in Iowa anymore, senator.Sen. Cruz had a point, but he blew it by not describing it so that even many New Yorkers would agree.One example: The greatest moral issue in America is four decades of failed inner-city public schools. In New York, local liberals won't lift a finger for minority-district schools in east Brooklyn, Harlem or the Bronx.Instead, Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio, like Jerry Brown in blue California, stay afloat on public unions and a liberal urban sea of smug, yuppie self-absorption. Donald Trump learned this week that these people don't even bother to vote. In 2013, New York's now-unpopular Mayor de Blasio won with 17% of eligible voters (turnout was 24%).New York, after its primary, will revert to its status as a blue-state automaton. Just now, New York's political values are a good subject.Hillary Clinton this week is defending herself against charges that as senator, she never delivered on her promises to beleaguered counties upstate. She blames George Bush's economic policies.More revelatory of New York values, though, is Vermonter Bernie Sanders, ranting about ""Wall Street"" and ""bankers."" To be clear: Those people, much mocked of late for living on Park Avenue and such, annually give tens of millions to support charter schools, scholarships to parochial schools, social entrepreneurs, and innumerable nonprofits and arts institutions. Most, Republican and Democrat, would do it without the tax deduction.Bernie is praising New York for its total ban on hydraulic fracking. Let me rephrase that as a local political value. New York City to upstate New York: Drop dead.Donald Trump projects himself as the embodiment of ""New York, New York,"" the ethos of making it big as sung by Frank Sinatra at the end of Yankees home games: ""Top of the list, King of the hill, A-number-one!""We then might have expected the Queens-born Mr. Trump to be campaigning everywhere in the city that never sleeps -- in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island. But no, he's been in places like Rochester and an airport hangar in Rome (N.Y.). Thursday evening, he'll attend the state party's fundraiser near Grand Central Terminal, with Gov. John Kasich and Mr. Cruz. The streets outside, of course, will be a zoo of protesters.The irony of the Trump ""outsider"" campaign in New York is almost too rich for words. Let's start with the relationship between New York politicians and real-estate developers, an ancient swamp of crony capitalism.Today the city's politicians green-light thousands of condominium units -- like the Trump apartment towers lining the West Side Highway -- because each one is a taxpayer-pod sending the pols revenue from a combined, top city-state tax rate of more than 12%. Even so, the city's perpetually wrecked road surfaces, paved with tire-busting steel plates, would embarrass a third-world capital.Still, as a construction guy, Mr. Trump knows as well as anyone what makes New York City tick. So why is Mr. A-Number-One in Rome? Because that's where his people are in a presidential campaign based mainly on two policies: building a wall on the Mexican border and putting a 35% tax on goods made in Asia.The Sinatra anthem also says, ""If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere."" And so it is that the immigration tides have been a New York value since, well, since they began arriving in the early 1600s, arguably illegally.The New York-born candidate who in North Carolina led chants -- ""Who's gonna build the wall? Mexico!"" -- knows that without the steady inflow of immigrants, legal or otherwise, to compensate for the out-migration of natives the past two decades, New York City would be in decline.As to trade, imposing a 35% price increase on goods made in China, Mexico, Japan and Vietnam -- which is to say clothing, shoes, foodstuffs, electronics, furniture -- would make living in New York totally unaffordable for most of its 8.5 million people. Needless to say, he knows that.But these New York City people aren't voting for Mr. Trump in his current incarnation, so they're ignorable. Also true, however, is that in 2012, an incredible 71% of Asians voted for Barack Obama because living in Democratic cities like New York, they rarely hear the alternative.Mr. Trump, an entrepreneur, should be the ideal pitchman to New York's many Asians, or to the black voters former Texas Gov. Rick Perry appealed to in his remarkable July speech. Instead, Mr. Trump is somewhere in the middle of the state, bashing the people who, he knows, are making New York City great again.Mr. Trump may win New York's primary and even the GOP nomination. But he could have been better.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",6/6/16

Stephen Sondheim was played by playwright and lyricist Lisa Kron, also smoking away--an idea her colleague Ms. Tesori came up with after watching videos of Bernstein's Norton lectures at Harvard University in 1973.""We decided we needed props,"" said Ms. Kron, who dug up the ersatz smokes from her show ""2.5 Minute Ride.""Book writer Arthur Laurents was represented by composer Michael John LaChiusa, while composer Michael Friedman gestured wildly in the role of Jerome Robbins.In an attempt to mimic Robbins, Mr. Friedman tried watching videos but then abandoned the idea: ""He had such a quiet confidence. He was like a shark.""Though it was a heady discussion, the laughs were many--and Ms. Rivera started it off with flashy leg kick: ""I still can pick 'em up!""The show ended with a comedic flourish as Ms. Streep lumbered onto the stage in drag, sporting a padded suit, red tie and decidedly orange complexion.Together with Christine Baranski, she sang ""Brush Up On Your Shakespeare (and the women you will wow)"" from the Cole Porter musical ""Kiss Me Kate,"" which chronicles the production of a musical version of ""The Taming of the Shrew.""The duet is traditionally sung by men.Write to Pia Catton at pia.catton@wsj.comCredit: By Pia Catton",6/7/16
"It's Time to Consider the Libertarian Ticket; Donald Trump's ascendancy shows that on too many major issues, the GOP no longer offers a coherent message.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793824250?accountid=12768,"Your editorial calls the Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson-William Weld ticket an ""honorable alternative"" to the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees, and indeed it is (""The Libertarian Alternative ,"" May 31). If Messrs. Johnson and Weld were the Republican standard bearers rather than the Libertarian ones, they would enjoy the full-throated support of conservatives and classical liberals who cherish the GOP's legacy of free markets and limited government. They are two successful former governors with unimpeachable conservative credentials on economic matters, tolerant views on social issues and bipartisan appeal to boot. In this election cycle, where the major parties offer voters a poor choice, the Johnson-Weld ticket is a no-brainer--or it would be if so many Americans weren't conditioned to dismiss the idea of a third-party candidate out of hand.Donald Trump's ascendancy has demonstrated that on too many major issues, the GOP no longer offers a coherent message to counter Democratic dogma. Republicans pay lip service to the goal of smaller government, but no progress has been made on that front since the 1980s.On the most important issues of the day--how to fix America's ailing economy, America's role in foreign affairs and the extent to which government should be allowed to curtail liberties to ameliorate perceived social problems--Libertarians, not Republicans, offer the starkest and most principled alternative to the Democratic Party.James LiddellWashingtonI couldn't agree more that the accomplished Libertarian ticket is an excellent alternative to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but more important, it would punish the two established parties for breaking faith with America for giving us unacceptable candidates. We know they are unacceptable because each party has based its message on how bad the other candidate would be rather than any actual policy or character considerations. This is insulting.At 10% now in the latest Fox poll, the Libertarians would need to take just 12% from each of the established parties to be positioned to win. A Libertarian presidency might just be what the country needs. Everybody would have to work together because they'd have no choice. With a Libertarian president standing between them, the usual Republican-Democratic rancor just wouldn't play.Dave DavisPhoenix",6/8/16
Consumers Don't Feel Trump's Pessimism; Friday's consumer-sentiment survey is expected to show people are actually fairly optimistic about the economy these days,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795086541?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump claims the economy is a disaster. Americans say otherwise.Consumer-sentiment surveys have shown people are actually pretty optimistic these days. And why shouldn't they be? Sure, the political bluster ahead of the presidential election seems particularly pointed this year. But the fact remains interest rates are low, gas prices are still cheap, home prices are up and wages are finally starting to tick higher. People are loosening the purse strings, too: Consumer spending recently advanced at the fastest pace in nearly seven years.Politics aside, that all helps explain why the University of Michigan's next consumer-sentiment reading, expected Friday, should be pretty decent. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the sentiment index hit 93.5 in June. That would be down a bit from last month's 94.7 reading, which was the highest in almost a year . But the survey, which questions 500 households about their financial conditions and feelings about the economy, still would be significantly higher than recessionary levels and above average for economic expansions.Perhaps this comes as little surprise. Surveys notwithstanding, a pretty reliable indicator of consumer sentiment is the stock market itself. When stocks rally, brokerage accounts go up and people tend to feel better about the economy. The S&P 500 has jumped 15% from February's nadir and record highs seem just around the corner.Consumer sentiment has a tendency to follow big stock gains. May's sentiment reading jumped 5.7 points from April, the biggest one-month jump in three years.That appears par for the course. Since 1978, the 20 biggest, sequential gains in the sentiment survey were preceded by an average S&P 500 gain of 1.4% the month before.Bullish investors might hope for consumer sentiment to keep improving. In presidential election years since 1980, when sentiment finished the year higher than where it started, the S&P 500 averaged a 12% gain. In years when sentiment fell, stocks rose just 0.2%, on average.Much can change in the second half of the year, of course. The May jobs report was particularly disappointing . Economic growth is still subpar. Troubles overseas remain a concern.Yet the gulf between scary headlines and current sentiment is ""yuge.""Credit: By Steven Russolillo",6/9/16
"Trump, Clinton, Tarullo? Bank Investors Have Lots to Ponder; Possible outcomes for regulation and the Fed are in focus as election moves to new phase",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794650595?accountid=12768,"The presidential battle lines are now clearly drawn between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. For bank investors, though, the picture remains blurry, and not just because the candidates' ultimate attitudes toward Wall Street are still tough to fathom.There are two other crucial issues related to the election that could impact valuations. First, is whether the make-up of the next Congress makes it more or less likely that legislators try to reopen the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul. Although that could benefit banks, altering the rulebook could actually cause more disruptions during an already challenging time for profitability.Second is who will lead the regulatory charge at the Federal Reserve. Given legislative gridlock, this could have a more immediate impact.Currently, that person is Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, one of the chief architects of the post-crisis regulatory system. But there's a chance 2017 may see him depart after what would be eight years in the role.Mr. Tarullo has in the past been heard expressing a desire to leave the Fed, according to a person familiar with the matter, but had decided to stay because certain regulatory initiatives weren't yet finished. Now, with most of them in place, the election could provide him with an exit point.What is more, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the president appoint a vice chair of supervision at the Fed. This is the role Mr. Tarullo holds in practice. But he doesn't have the formal title.The simplest explanation for this: the White House figured Mr. Tarullo wouldn't win Senate confirmation given animosity among banks over the tough line he has taken in bringing Wall Street to heel and questions about the Fed's approach to too-big-to-fail banks.The election could change the status quo, though. If Mr. Trump wins the White House, it would seem likely he would nominate a vice chair for supervision. Even if Mr. Tarullo stays, the new person would assume supervisory authority.Change may be in the offing, too, if Mrs. Clinton wins. New administrations tend to want their own people in top roles. There would also likely be calls to fill the still-vacant Dodd-Frank role. Granted, Mr. Tarullo was an official in President Bill Clinton's administration, so an exit isn't a given.Still, investors have to ponder potential consequences of a change.The Fed under Mr. Tarullo hasn't tried to break up big banks. Instead it essentially gave them a choice: stay big and be effectively taxed through higher capital charges, or shrink. Should the Fed pursue a different approach, it would have big implications for business models, bank structure and valuation.Then there are the Fed's annual bank ""stress tests."" Mr. Tarullo has consistently honed these and often made them tougher. And last week he said that coming tests would likely incorporate a new, additional capital surcharge for the biggest, globally important banks.Furthermore, the stress tests have a qualitative, as well as quantitative, aspect, that vests enormous power in the Fed and the person overseeing the process. So any change could affect banks' ability to return capital , and in turn the level of returns they can generate.Ultimately, the Fed's course on interest rates will be the biggest driver for bank stocks. But its regulatory approach will determine how banks manage in any new rate environment.Corrections & AmplificationsFed governor Daniel Tarullo has consistently honed annual bank stress tests and often made conditions tougher. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that he has said he plans to make them tougher each year.Write to David Reilly at david.reilly@wsj.comCredit: By David Reilly",6/9/16

In a speech given at the UC Berkeley School of Law (Oct. 26, 2001) on the effect of gender and ethnicity on judging, the future Supreme Court justice spoke about the influence her Latina identity had on her presence on the bench. Her remarks were far more diplomatic than Mr. Trump's, but she reached virtually the same conclusion. Some examples from the speech: ""Our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging."" . . . ""Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see."" . . . ""But I accept there will be some [difference] based on my gender and my Latina heritage."" Finally, ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.""It is hard to argue with any of these statements. They appear to be simply common sense. But when The Donald makes the same points, he is called a bigot and a racist. Why?Harry O. McKinneySouthfield, Mich.---I am no fan of Donald Trump. However, the last time I looked, being a Mexican is indicative of one's nationality, not his or her race. So however ill-advised Mr. Trump's criticism of the judge hearing the Trump University case may be, characterizing it as racist is inaccurate and, no doubt, politically motivated.Edward VeilleuxHunt Valley, Md.---Mr. Trump may consider himself the smartest guy on the planet, but publicly trashing the judge who is hearing your case is about the dumbest thing any litigant can do. Claiming judicial bias based on the judge's ethnicity also is absolutely unprecedented. In several decades of practicing and following the law I've never heard of anything even close to that. But to publicly trash an ethnic group and then claim that the judge has a conflict of interest because he is of that same ethinc group is utterly disingenuous and the very epitome of chutzpah.Foster De ReitzesSan Francisco---The progressive mantra for several years has been that white male privilege is so ingrained in the fabric of America that no white male can ever consider matters in an unbiased fashion. Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was born and raised in Indiana by Mexican-American parents, had been a member of the La Raza Lawyers Association of San Diego before becoming a judge. The San Diego group is an affiliate of the Chicano/Latino Bar Association of California that is directly affiliated with the National Council of La Raza. The NCLR favors comprehensive immigration reform that grants ""earned"" legalization (citizenship) to undocumented people in the U.S. and vehemently opposes construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. La Raza lawyers fight enforcement of existing immigration laws by promoting ""sanctuary cities"" that prevent police from checking the immigration status of criminals.America is so fixated on race and gender that it may be impossible for justice to be blind. With Donald Trump leading the charge for border security and a tougher approach to illegal immigration, is it outrageous for him to think that a wise Latino man with the richness of his experiences would make a ""better"" decision regarding Trump University than would a privileged white male? A better decision that hurts Donald Trump's presidential prospects would delight La Raza. Progressives made this rainbow bed and Donald Trump, in his own crude way, is pulling back the covers.Sean NaplesAsheville, N.C.",6/13/16
"Election 2016: Poll: Negatives Rise for Front-Runners --- Clinton's favorability shows a steep decline, while Trump's gap is widest of any hopeful",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781479053?accountid=12768,"Both parties' presidential front-runners are growing increasingly unpopular, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, with Hillary Clinton showing an especially steep decline over the past month.Among voters in both parties, 56% hold a negative view of Mrs. Clinton and 32% hold a positive view. That 24-point gap is almost twice as wide as in a Journal/NBC poll last month, when 51% viewed her negatively and 38% positively, a 13-point gap.Republican front-runner Donald Trump continues to be the candidate in either party viewed most negatively, with 65% of registered voters viewing him unfavorably and 24% favorably, a 41-point difference. Unlike with Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, those numbers haven't changed much over the past month.Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump's nearest GOP competitor, has an image problem of his own. Nearly half of voters see him in a negative light, while 26% view him positively.The entire field of candidates, on both sides of the aisle, suffers a popularity deficit: Not one is regarded favorably by more than half of registered voters.The candidate with the least baggage is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also is the least well known. Some 31% of registered voters view him favorably and 19% view him unfavorably; 31% are neutral, and 19% don't know him or aren't sure.Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton's primary foe, also has more fans than detractors: 45% of voters viewed him positively and 36% view him negatively.Mrs. Clinton's decline came during a month in which she has been hit by an intensifying barrage of attacks, not just from GOP candidates but from Mr. Sanders, who has won a string of victories in primaries and caucuses.Mr. Trump, similarly, has been outperformed by Mr. Cruz, whose campaign has been racking up delegates at smaller state conventions. Mr. Cruz scored another victory at the Wyoming state convention Saturday, where he picked up all 14 delegates up for grabs, following similar strong showings in Colorado and North Dakota.The Cruz campaign also notched procedural wins Saturday in Georgia and South Carolina. In both states, Cruz delegates won trips to the national convention, even though Mr. Trump won both states convincingly.In South Carolina, state law requires those Republicans backing Mr. Cruz to vote for Mr. Trump on the first ballot, given his big win in the state in February, but they can shift to Mr. Cruz in subsequent rounds of voting.The campaign now shifts to the big prize of New York, the home state of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. Both front-runners hold sizable leads ahead of Tuesday's vote, according to polls.All the candidates are viewed more favorably within their parties. Among Democrats, some 63% have a positive image of Mrs. Clinton, while 20% have a negative image. Mr. Sanders is viewed positively by 73% of Democrats, negatively by 11%Mr. Trump is viewed favorably and unfavorably in equal measure among Republicans, with 42% seeing him in a positive light and 42% in a negative light. Mr. Cruz is viewed favorably by 45% of Republicans and unfavorably by 27%.While some establishment Republicans dream of the party nominating House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as an alternative to Messrs. Trump and Cruz, he might not be a strong general-election candidate.The poll found that 28% of registered voters view him negatively and 26% positively.Last week, Mr. Ryan re-emphasized that he shouldn't be considered for the Republican presidential nomination.The survey of 1,000 registered voters was taken April 10-14 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.---Patrick O'Connor contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook",6/13/16

Under those conditions, he said, the U.S. wouldn't be entitled to its position as the world's major power.""Almost any across-the-board tariff increase would violate U.S. obligations under the WTO,"" said Jeffrey Schott, a trade economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank backing free trade.In a statement, Mr. Trump charged that China was ""in total violation of WTO regulations"" and that the U.S. ""has incompetently allowed them to get away with this"" and has failed to impose ""equal or greater taxes and tariffs"" on China. If he is elected president, Mr. Trump said, China ""will learn to deal fairly and justly or we will not deal at all"" with Beijing.In a Trump presidency, he added, ""all trade and other agreements will be totally and completely renegotiated"" so the U.S. will become a ""beneficiary of trade, and we will no longer be thought of as fools.""Asked about the tough talk on China in the presidential campaign, from both Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Lou said Americans needed to recognize the U.S. and China ""are mutually dependent on each other"" and both have a lot to lose in any economic confrontation. ""Our economic cycles are intertwined,"" he said. ""We have more in common than sets us apart.""Mr. Lou also said he understood that rhetoric in a presidential campaign gets heated and often doesn't reflect the policies an incoming administration would adopt. With a new administration, he said, ""U.S.-China ties should be more or less as they are now.""Mr. Lou is the most senior Chinese official to comment on Mr. Trump. In March, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was asked about the U.S. election -- though not Mr. Trump specifically -- and said it was ""lively and caught the eyes of many."" In daily briefings, the foreign ministry declines to answer questions about Mr. Trump or other U.S. presidential candidates.China this year leads the Group of 20, whose finance ministers met on Friday during the International Monetary Fund's spring meetings in Washington. Many participants welcomed signs of stabilization in the Chinese economy. But they raised concerns that authorities there haven't been carrying out economic overhauls as fast as necessary, potentially leading to other problems down the road.Mr. Lou urged patience from the rest of the world. ""In China, there are big distortions in our economic system,"" he said.The Chinese finance minister urged the U.S. to increase its public and private investment to improve the U.S. economy and make a contribution to global growth. He argued China had done its part in 2009 during the global financial crisis by putting in place a large stimulus program. That spending, he argued, helped buck up global growth.Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the U.S. government has long played an important role in bolstering the domestic and global economy. ""When the government needed to step in during the [global financial] crisis, we stepped in,"" he told reporters Friday.Credit: By Bob Davis and Lingling Wei",6/13/16
"Election 2016: As Trump Storms His Home State, Party Still Split",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781478898?accountid=12768,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Donald Trump received a hero's welcome Sunday in the most Republican borough in New York City, though the GOP presidential primary remains as unsettled as ever.Nationally, voters and party leaders continue to express sharply polarized views about Mr. Trump and the prospect of a contested national convention in July.""I've never seen such division,"" said Craig Eaton, former chairman of the Kings County Republican Party in Brooklyn, who said he hasn't decided on a candidate. ""It's the middle of April, and the Republican Party should be 100% united behind a candidate to win this election.""Republicans packed a Staten Island hotel ballroom to see Mr. Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, address the local party's annual gala. The businessman said the audience of 1,500 to 1,700 people was the biggest crowd the Hilton Garden Inn had ever seen -- though GOP officials pegged the audience at a slightly lower total.""Build a larger room,"" quipped Mr. Trump, who polls show could sweep all 95 of the state's delegates in Tuesday's New York primary, increasing the possibility of his claiming the nomination before the GOP convention.Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has won only his home-state primary so far, is relishing his second-place polling status in the Empire State and trying to keep Mr. Trump's support under a key 50% threshold in targeted congressional districts. ""I couldn't have had a better time,"" he said Saturday of campaigning in New York, while he was visiting a Manhattan deli.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has campaigned on and off in New York and plans to spend part of Monday and Tuesday in Maryland and Pennsylvania, which vote on April 26.On Sunday, Cruz supporters in New York distributed a voter guide to churchgoers that highlighted the senator's support for shielding same-sex marriage opponents from accusations of bias and cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood.""Even if Kasich wins delegates in New York, it's not going to make a difference,"" said Jason McGuire, executive director of the New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms PAC, one of Mr. Cruz's few endorsements in New York. ""Cruz's eyes are elsewhere because he needs big wins to finish.""In the Staten Island ballroom, Mr. Trump entered to the crowd chanting his name and ""USA! USA! USA!"" Baseball caps and campaign jerseys bearing Mr. Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan were popular at the $150-a-plate brunch, and many people remained on their feet during his remarks.Joe Esposito, 52 years old, was sitting with his fellow firefighters wearing their navy blue uniform. ""Trump is a regular guy just like us,"" he said. ""He says what people want to say but are afraid to say it.""The front-runner isn't easing up on his criticism of party rules despite pleas from GOP officials, laying the groundwork to question the credibility of any convention results that leave him without the nomination.""They lie. It's all a rigged deal,"" Mr. Trump said. ""When I get the nomination, we're going to come together and we're going to win New York,"" Mr. Trump said of the state that hasn't been won by a GOP nominee since 1984.Mr. Kasich's cherry-picking strategy in New York was aimed at Jewish voters on Saturday. He spoke at an orthodox synagogue on Long Island and ate pickles at the Manhattan deli. He didn't use any utensils -- a point of concern among some New Yorkers after he recently ate a slice of pizza with a knife and fork.""Am I going to beat Donald in New York? That's a tall order, but I think we're going to have momentum coming out of New York and we're going to win delegates,"" Mr. Kasich said.But even some of Mr. Kasich's supporters at the deli acknowledged his chances of winning the nomination are slim. Either they are holding out hope or simply refusing to vote for Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz because they see them as too divisive or extreme.""I can't have my name associated with Cruz or Trump,"" said Mike Mazur, a 30-year-old real-estate agent dining with his girlfriend and her grandmother, who lives in a Trump-owned building but favors Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.Credit: By Beth Reinhard",6/13/16
"The Place That Wants Donald Trump Most --- Buchanan County, Va., shows his support and the challenge he poses",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781478850?accountid=12768,"BUCHANAN COUNTY, Va. -- There isn't much Jody Bostic believes in these days.The government has abandoned him, he feels. Local coal mines have laid him off so many times he opened a T-shirt store to make a living. Big-city media treat him and his neighbors like know-nothings.His remaining hope: Donald Trump will become president and use his business skills to bring jobs to this Appalachian mountain county. ""Hey, in this county, things are going downhill. People are getting laid off. People are leaving,"" says the 39-year-old former miner. ""If Trump don't get it, it will be another blow.""Mr. Trump won Buchanan County with 69.7% of the vote in the March 1 Republican primary, the highest percentage vote he has collected in any U.S. county so far. A close look at the white, working-class enclave, which is in Virginia's southwest, provides a clearer picture of why Mr. Trump inspires supporters and poses problems for anti-Trump GOP strategists.Voters here say Mr. Trump understands their frustration and will fight the Washington establishment on their behalf. In an area awash in uncertainty -- Will mines remain open? Will the river flood? Must the young leave to find work? -- he is a reassuring presence, someone who has visited their living rooms for years via television.Here, as elsewhere, his message of American renewal, closed borders and antigovernment populism resonates despite his brashness, even among Democrats.His wealth isn't a put-off. County Sheriff Ray Foster, who supports Mr. Trump, says rich businessmen have long been well-liked around the county because ""they make jobs for the people here.""As for the imbroglios over Mr. Trump's comments about women and his shifting views on abortion and foreign policy, which have driven up his negative ratings in national polls, they are generally seen here as a plus. They reinforce his outsider status.""He talks before he thinks,"" Mr. Foster says, ""so he doesn't have time to think up something and lie to you.""The lessons are important for New York, where Mr. Trump is heavily favored to win the primary on Tuesday and has a chance of peeling off working-class Democrats in the general election. He could do especially well in Republican strongholds along the state's southern tier, federally classified as part of Appalachia. Counties there share some characteristics of Buchanan County.In Buchanan County, Mr. Trump has won over many Democrats because he not only ""speaks for them -- he speaks in terms they're comfortable with,"" says Gerald Arrington, the county's commonwealth's attorney and a registered Democrat. Mr. Arrington says Mr. Trump won his vote in the Virginia primary, the first time he had cast a vote for a Republican.The 1,586 votes Mr. Trump received in the county were triple the total for the Democratic primary winner, Hillary Clinton. Eight years ago, the county was solidly Democratic: Mrs. Clinton won 2,245 votes then in a primary against Barack Obama, defeating him 90% to 9%, and collecting more than five times as many votes as the Republican primary winner.Many in the county blame the Obama administration's regulations for a downturn in the coal industry and figure Mr. Trump will quash those rules and ignore scientists who warn about global warming.Nationwide, the 10 counties Mr. Trump has carried by the largest margins have much in common. They are mainly white, rural and southern. They sharply lag behind the national average in household income and education, and top it in poverty and disability payments.Four of these counties rely on agriculture, says Moody's Analytics, while another three are local transportation hubs. A big employer in one, Tallahatchie County, Miss., is a prison.While people in these counties feel left behind, they don't face the challenges from immigration or foreign trade that Mr. Trump has made his signature issues. All but two of the counties trail the nation by wide margins in percentage of the population that are immigrants. Few face much pressure from Chinese imports. Buchanan County benefits from trade, especially through coal exports to China.Instead, Mr. Trump's appeal is visceral. According to an October 2015 Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 76% of Trump supporters feel ""uneasy and out of place"" in their own country, compared with 62% of Republicans who say they wouldn't consider voting for him.""Trump has an appeal that a traditional Republican would have a hard time matching,"" says Jeff Horwitt, a senior vice president at pollster Hart Research. If Mr. Trump is denied the nomination at the Republican convention despite a clear lead among delegates -- a possibility being discussed by some in the party -- Republican turnout could fall sharply, he adds.Robert Collins, 43, a Buchanan County trucker, says he isn't sure he could bring himself to vote for Sen. Ted Cruz if he wins the nomination by undermining Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump's cocky style has turned off some supporters, including Ralph Rife, a disabled coal miner in Slate Creek who voted for him but now says he can't stomach him. ""He's like a loose cannon,"" Mr. Rife says, citing Mr. Trump's encouragement of Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons and his shifting abortion position.Buchanan County has long seen itself as cut off from the American mainstream, separated by mountains, accents and a mining culture with the ever-present danger of cave-ins and explosions. Natives of this county at the westernmost edge of Virginia like to say ""Virginia ends at Roanoke,"" a city with a trendy downtown about 180 miles east.""We're like in purgatory,"" says James L. Rife, 54, who pulls up near a local Wal-Mart to buy Trump T-shirts sold out of the back of a black SUV. ""You ain't dead, but you ain't alive."" Mr. Rife has lived on disability checks since 1991 after he got buried in a mine cave-in.In the 1970s, coal trucks were so common residents complained about coal dust on cars and windows. When Danny Smith, 53, now a coal-mine superintendent, finished high school in 1981, he says his uncle left him miner's boots and a hard hat on his porch as a graduation present. In the 1990s, miners say, they could quit, walk down the road and find work at a different mine. Coal companies competed to hold the most elaborate Christmas parties.Coal-industry employment has shrunk due to automation and declining markets. The county's population has fallen 27% since 1990 to 23,000 and has grown older as young people depart. Inflation-adjusted median income is barely half the national average and hasn't budged since 1995, Moody's Analytics estimates. Three times as many Buchanan households receive Social Security disability checks as have a college graduate.Novelist Lee Smith, who was born in the county and writes about it, says fatalism and depression are rampant. The county seat of Grundy, on the Levisa Fork River, has had nine major floods since 1929. One in 1977 destroyed its shopping district. A $177 million flood renovation project replaced the buildings with a highway and carved away part of a mountain to create flat land for the Wal-Mart, which opened in 2011.""It's been nothing but construction and red mud for 15 years,"" Ms. Smith says of the reconstruction. ""People are voting against what's happening to them. There's a disgust with the way things have been going.""For decades, that distrust translated into votes for Democrats, a tradition nurtured by the United Mine Workers and memories of the New Deal and Great Society. Al Gore carried the county in 2000 with 58% of the vote against George W. Bush, despite local suspicion of environmentalists. John Kerry did nearly as well four years later. Mr. Obama lost the county in 2008, but not heavily, 46% to 54%, to Sen. John McCain.In 2009, the area elected a Republican to the Virginia House of Delegates for first time since the 1950s. In 2010, 14-term Democratic Rep. Rick Boucher was defeated for re-election. By 2012, the county was solidly GOP, with Mr. Obama receiving 32% of the vote in his re-election bid.Vern Presley, the county's Democratic Party chairman, traces the Democrats' decline to the widespread belief Mr. Obama's environmental policies are crippling coal. He thinks the charge is unfair because coal is also hammered by cheap natural gas and shrinking foreign demand.The charge sticks, and it benefits Mr. Trump, who pledges to eliminate the federal Environmental Protection Agency. At a February rally at Radford University, a 2.5-hour drive from Buchanan County, he told a cheering audience ""we're going to bring the coal industry back 100%."" He is one of the few presidential candidates to campaign in coal country this election.Mrs. Clinton is unwelcome. Local residents seem to have memorized her televised remarks in March that if she became president ""we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,"" a comment she later said was a mistake. Joe Street, vice president of a coal-mine machinery supplier near Grundy, says he can imagine lawn signs this fall: ""Hillary Clinton: The War On Coal.""Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon notes that Mrs. Clinton has proposed a $30 billion plan to aid coal communities.The Trump slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" say supporters here, means returning to the economy of 10 years ago, when coal held its own and the global economy hadn't suffered through the financial crisis and its aftermath. Coal miners in the county were paid an average $90,334 in 2014, the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics figures available, but such jobs are rapidly disappearing. Half the licensed coal mines closed between 2013 and 2015, reducing coal miners by 50% to 1,028, according to Virginia's mining authority.While the county has looked to diversify its economy, the new jobs pay far less. A Sykes Enterprises call center advertised starting hourly wages of $9.50 last year. Wal-Mart pays about $10.At a dinner early this month with eight coal-industry executives in a local Chinese restaurant, all nod when asked if they support Mr. Trump. ""We want a leader,"" says Jeff Taylor, a local coal-mine operator who says he has slashed his workforce by one-third since 2012. ""Trump may be the one with enough backbone to pull back some of the government"" regulations.That is a widespread sentiment among ordinary workers, too. Why is there such faith that a billionaire will deliver for the working class?One such local, coal entrepreneur Arthur ""Smiley"" Ratliff, was Trump-like in his tastes, recalls Ms. Smith, the novelist. He drove in a black Rolls Royce, his face black with coal dust, and lived in a fortresslike mansion. He used Ming vases for umbrella stands, say locals who trade Smiley stories, and petitioned Britain to let him build an estate on an uninhabited British island in the South Pacific to be far from Washington regulation. (The British government declined.)It isn't a big leap from Mr. Ratliff, who died in 2007, to Mr. Trump and his Boeing 757 airplane with gold-plated fixtures, Ms. Smith says.Mr. Bostic, the former coal miner, says he had enough of mining after being laid off three times in 13 months. He and his wife opened the T-shirt shop last month a few miles from Grundy and sell uniforms for church groups and softball teams. He says he isn't making near the $90,000 he did as a coal-mine ""blaster,"" an explosives expert.The pay cut forced him to default on his timeshare condo, he says, and he struggles to make payments on the $300,000 house he bought in 2011 when his mining job seemed secure. He sells buffalo jerky on the side and is training to become a school-bus driver.He says he is looking to Mr. Trump for help. If the Republican can turn around the coal industry by slashing regulations, that should pump money into the local economy.""Trump for us is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Mr. Bostic's wife, Sara. With him, ""there's some hope normalcy will come back to our area.""Credit: By Bob Davis and Rebecca Ballhaus",6/13/16
Election 2016: Trump's Edge on Twitter Cuts Both Ways,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781478847?accountid=12768,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump has used Twitter to engage the public more aggressively than his rivals, and the potential pitfalls of that tactic are increasingly visible.The New York businessman's broad appeal, coupled with his approach to citing supportive tweets, has given him a sizable advantage over his opponents on the platform: Mr. Trump boasts 7.6 million followers, compared with 1.05 million for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, his chief rival for the GOP nomination, and just 288,000 followers for Ohio Gov John Kasich. Mr. Trump is also ahead of Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, with an audience of 5.93 million followers, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with 1.97 million.Mr. Trump has also adopted a signature style on Twitter: Instead of simply retweeting a user's expression of excitement for a rally or compliments for a televised interview, he frames the tweets in quotes, sometimes adding a short expression of ""great!"" or ""thank you!"" He then sends the tweet from his own account, bringing attention to a wide range of users, not all of whom are known to the candidate.By comparison, his rivals tweet more conservatively. Mrs. Clinton last week retweeted her husband former President Bill Clinton, campaign staffers, and news organizations tweeting articles about the 2016 race. Mr. Cruz retweets supporters, but his feed is mostly his own quotes, images from rallies and news clips.Mr. Trump's personal, unrestrained approach has landed him in hot water, as he has shared messages from accounts that appear to be tied to white supremacists. In another incident, he shared an image mocking Heidi Cruz, Mr. Cruz's wife.In a CNN appearance last week, Mr. Trump conceded: ""The tweets are fine. The retweets sometimes get a little bit shaky.""When CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Melania Trump if she ever tried to get her husband to put his phone away or rein in his Twitter account, she said she had tried. ""Anderson, if he would only listen. I do say it many times,"" she said. ""He's an adult, he knows the consequences.""Ben Carson, a former presidential rival turned campaign surrogate, recently called the freewheeling nature of Mr. Trump's Twitter account a ""problem"" in an interview with a Florida radio station.Mr. Trump's aggressive approach also leaves him more vulnerable to engaging with a category of accounts that Twitter watchers call ""fake"" or ""bot"" accounts -- because they appear automated to some degree and aren't associated with a real person in the way a typical social-media account is. Some of these accounts have been found to promote extremist or offensive views, and some may be created solely to automate tweets of particular views -- so they don't truly represent individual opinions.In many cases, the users that Mr. Trump cites tweet solely about the Republican front-runner, an unusual pattern since people typically tweet about a variety of things, said Gil Eyal, CEO of HYPR, a social-media data firm that has researched candidates' social-media presences.Creating or automating multiple accounts is frowned upon in Twitter's best practices for developers. Alternatively, a ""fake account"" is an account that may appear to have a large following but has actually bought its followers -- and may be followed by bots or other fake accounts.While Mr. Trump controls his own Twitter account and sends or dictates his tweets, the Trump campaign says his team isn't behind any coordinated effort to build followers or send messages online.""The campaign has no connection to any other Twitter accounts,"" said campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks. ""The focus is Mr. Trump and that is his completely authentic account, and anything else is the Internet; we don't control it.""To be sure, Mr. Trump isn't alone in having a large number of bots among his Twitter followers, though he has a larger percentage of them. HYPR estimates that a quarter of his followers are ""inactive,"" which includes bot accounts generated solely to look like a follower and real accounts that followed a person but then stopped using the platform. About 20% of Mrs. Clinton's followers are estimated to fall into this category. Seventeen percent of Mr. Cruz's audience is inactive, as is 10% of Mr. Sanders's audience. HYPR didn't provide data for Mr. Kasich due to the small size of his audience.It is difficult to trace who is behind sending the tweets or creating the accounts, experts say, adding that these accounts don't appear to be tied to the Trump campaign. ""The effort seems to be very elaborate and almost professionalized. It's clear that, whether or not people are being paid, this is a full-time job for numerous people,"" said Patrick Ruffini, the founder of Echelon Insights, a digital analysis firm. Mr. Ruffini directed the Republican National Committee's digital strategy in 2006 and supports a movement opposing Mr. Trump known as #NeverTrump.The involvement of pro-Trump bots and fake senders in retweeting and liking Trump campaign posts amplify his message on Twitter. Moreover, a change made to Twitter in February plays up tweets that are retweeted and liked in high quantities to the top of users' timelines, making bots a useful way of gaining publicity for certain accounts.Credit: By Natalie Andrews",6/13/16
Election 2016: Trump Strikes Chord in N.Y. Suburb --- Businessman finds support among economically anxious voters in Long Island,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781094299?accountid=12768,"MINEOLA, N.Y. -- The way Ron DeMarrais sees it, Donald Trump couldn't have picked a better year to run for president.The 50-year-old builder from Long Island has watched his middle-class lifestyle get squeezed as construction projects have failed to return to this area, leaving the Lynbrook, N.Y., Republican to sell vintage scrap materials that he salvages from upstate.""We are broken as a nation. There's terrible politics going on,"" said Mr. DeMarrais, who will back Mr. Trump in New York's GOP presidential primary on Tuesday. ""All the people I know are either for Trump or on the fence.""Bucking trends elsewhere, Mr. Trump is attracting strong support among Mr. DeMarrais and other voters inLongIsland -- a suburb of New York City that is home to great wealth, poverty and an uneasy middle class.Mr. Trump hasn't done as well with suburban Republicans in Iowa, Virginia and other primary states. A Quinnipiac University poll in March showed Ohio Gov. John Kasich has the highest favorable rating among New York's suburban GOP voters as a whole, surpassing rivals Mr. Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.But Mr. Trump's bravado has resonated here in a good way, even as it can rub voters in other parts of the country the wrong way, political analysts said.LongIslandhas a history of strained relations between white residents and its growing immigrant population. Though the atmosphere has been calmer in recent years, Mr. Trump's tough stance on illegal immigration has found support with certain swaths of white, working-class Republicans in the area.""There was very strong and open anti-immigrant sentiment"" here, said Lawrence Levy, dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. ""Is it possible [Mr. Trump] has torn a scab off a wound? It was just covered up?""The businessman returned to Long Island on Thursday to headline a Suffolk County Republican Committee's fundraiser in Patchogue. The village drew national attention in 2008 after a 37-year-old Ecuadorean immigrant was beaten to death by seven Long Island teenagers. Prosecutors said the attack was part of a ritualistic hunt for area Latinos; the teens were convicted of gang assault.""Our community is outraged. It's pouring salt in the wound,"" said Rev. Allan B. Ramirez, a Long Island pastor and activist, who organized a protest of the Trump event.Suffolk County Republican Chairman John Jay LaValle said the party traditionally holds a fundraiser in Patchogue, all the GOP candidates were invited, and the location was in no way meant to evoke memories of the attack.LongIsland as well as StatenIslandand stretches of Queens -- two boroughs of New York City -- are set to give Mr. Trump his highest percentage of support statewide next week, said Patrick Murray of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. ""I wouldn't be surprised if he easily gets over 60% of the vote in those areas,"" he said. ""Trump is just one of them, personality-wise. They can identify with him, even despite his wealth.""The intensity of his support was on display at a rally in Bethpage, N.Y., last week where over 10,000 people cheered him. At least two people were carried out in stretchers from the crush, and fans chanted ""I love you, Trump.""Economically, Long Island doesn't share many of the grim indicators seen in the Rust Belt and southern states where Mr. Trump's message has struck a chord with angry voters. The unemployment rate has been steadily falling, to 4.5% in February. The area has a robust biotechnology industry and is adding jobs beyond just the service sector, said Mr. Levy.But some local Republicans said they don't feel things are on the upswing. Small-business owners said they are struggling to keep up with rising costs, including health-care mandates under the Affordable Care Act.""You drive down Jericho Turnpike and you see storefront after storefront for rent. People have just given up,"" said Kathleen Johnson, 50, a Great Neck, N.Y., homemaker.The GOP chairmen from both Nassau and Suffolk counties have endorsed Mr. Trump. ""He's the only one of the candidates who is going to try to bring jobs back to this country, who is going to secure the borders,"" said Mr. LaValle.Not everyone is in the Trump camp. Maura Ruggiero, a 53-year-old Smithtown, N.Y., Republican backing Mr. Cruz, was disappointed to see many family members gravitate to Mr. Trump despite admiring the Texas senator's conservative values. ""They've bought into it,"" said Ms. Ruggiero, a poultry farmer, of the Trump campaign. ""They just think he's so loud and boisterous.""Credit: By Heather Haddon",6/13/16
Election 2016: Florida Won't Charge Trump Campaign Chief,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781094225?accountid=12768,"Florida prosecutors said Thursday that they wouldn't charge Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign manager with battery in an incident involving a reporter.Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, said in a news conference that Corey Lewandowski wouldn't face charges for allegedly grabbing the arm of reporter Michelle Fields while she was trying to ask Mr. Trump a question at an event in Jupiter, Fla., in March.Mr. Aronberg made clear that he believed there was ample evidence that some physical contact between the two occurred, despite earlier denials from the Trump campaign. But Mr. Aronberg also said that in a situation involving a political candidate being protected by the U.S. Secret Service, close aides are often given latitude to help keep people from the candidate.The evidence ""is not strong enough to meet the legal burden of a reasonable likelihood of a conviction,"" Mr. Aronberg said.Ms. Fields, who at the time was a reporter for the website Breitbart News, filed a complaint with the police that resulted in a misdemeanor charge of simple battery against Mr. Lewandowski in March. Mr. Trump has stood by Mr. Lewandowski, a 42-year-old political operative and former New Hampshire state police officer who has helped propel Mr. Trump to the top of the GOP presidential field.The incident came amid mounting public concern over fights and assaults at packed Trump rallies, where protesters often face off with supporters. The Trump campaign has done little to stop violent encounters, according to critics. Mr. Trump has said he doesn't encourage violence.In a statement Thursday, the Trump campaign said: ""Corey Lewandowski is gratified by the decision to drop the misdemeanor charge and appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the Palm Beach State Attorney and his staff who carefully reviewed this matter, as well as Mr. Trump's loyalty and the support of his colleagues and family during this time. The matter is now concluded.""Mr. Lewandowski has repeatedly denied that he touched Ms. Fields, though video of the incident appears to show him yanking her away from the candidate. The encounter between Ms. Fields and the Trump campaign manager was also witnessed by a Washington Post reporter who wrote a story describing the incident.Shortly after the incident occurred, Mr. Lewandowski called Ms. Fields ""delusional"" in a tweet, saying: ""I never touched you.

His attorney Brad Cohen backed away from that claim on Thursday, acknowledging that some physical contact seems to have occurred.Mr. Cohen said that as part of his defense of Mr. Lewandowski he provided prosecutors evidence that the Secret Service had been attempting to move reporters away from Mr. Trump before the alleged encounter.Ms. Fields didn't respond to a request for comment, but on Twitter expressed disappointment in the prosecutor's decision not to bring charges and anger that she hadn't been informed directly ahead of the announcement.Following the incident, Ms. Fields resigned her position with Breitbart after other employees at the website cast doubt on her account.Credit: By Byron Tau",6/13/16
"Trump, the 'Mexican' Judge and Wise Latinas; Why is it so offensive when Donald Trump equates ethnicity with judicial bias but it's fine when Sonia Sotomayor does?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795775239?accountid=12768,"Regarding your editorial ""Trump and the 'Mexican' Judge "" (June 6): Why is it so offensive when Donald Trump equates ethnicity with judicial bias but it is fine when Sonia Sotomayor does it? In a speech given at the UC Berkeley School of Law (Oct. 26, 2001) on the effect of gender and ethnicity on judging, the future Supreme Court justice spoke about the influence her Latina identity had on her presence on the bench. Her remarks were far more diplomatic than Mr. Trump's, but she reached virtually the same conclusion. Some examples from the speech: ""Our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging."" . . . ""Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see."" . . .""But I accept there will be some [difference] based on my gender and my Latina heritage."" Finally, ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.""It is hard to argue with any of these statements. They appear to be simply common sense. But when The Donald makes the same points, he is called a bigot and a racist. Why?Harry O. McKinneySouthfield, Mich.I am no fan of Donald Trump. However, the last time I looked, being a Mexican is indicative of one's nationality, not his or her race. So however ill-advised Mr. Trump's criticism of the judge hearing the Trump University case may be, characterizing it as racist is inaccurate and, no doubt, politically motivated.Edward VeilleuxHunt Valley, Md.Mr. Trump may consider himself the smartest guy on the planet, but publicly trashing the judge who is hearing your case is about the dumbest thing any litigant can do. Claiming judicial bias based on the judge's ethnicity also is absolutely unprecedented. In several decades of practicing and following the law I've never heard of anything even close to that. But to publicly trash an ethnic group and then claim that the judge has a conflict of interest because he is of that same ethinc group is utterly disingenuous and the very epitome of chutzpah.Foster De ReitzesSan FranciscoThe progressive mantra for several years has been that white male privilege is so ingrained in the fabric of America that no white male can ever consider matters in an unbiased fashion. Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was born and raised in Indiana by Mexican-American parents, had been a member of the La Raza Lawyers Association of San Diego before becoming a judge. The San Diego group is an affiliate of the Chicano/Latino Bar Association of California that is directly affiliated with the National Council of La Raza. The NCLR favors comprehensive immigration reform that grants ""earned"" legalization (citizenship) to undocumented people in the U.S. and vehemently opposes construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. La Raza lawyers fight enforcement of existing immigration laws by promoting ""sanctuary cities"" that prevent police from checking the immigration status of criminals.America is so fixated on race and gender that it may be impossible for justice to be blind. With Donald Trump leading the charge for border security and a tougher approach to illegal immigration, is it outrageous for him to think that a wise Latino man with the richness of his experiences would make a ""better"" decision regarding Trump University than would a privileged white male? A better decision that hurts Donald Trump's presidential prospects would delight La Raza. Progressives made this rainbow bed and Donald Trump, in his own crude way, is pulling back the covers.Sean NaplesAsheville, N.C.",6/14/16
Election 2016: Trump's Delegate Czar Gets Bigger Role,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779338361?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's campaign on Thursday announced an expanded role for its delegate czar, Paul Manafort.Mr. Manafort, who officially joined the Trump campaign to oversee the delegate fight last month but so far has remained subordinate to campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, ""will oversee, manage, and be responsible for all activities that pertain to Mr. Trump's delegate process and the Cleveland Convention,"" according to an announcement by the Trump campaign.The announcement comes as Mr. Lewandowski has been at the center of a series of distractions for the front-runner's campaign. Last month, he was charged with misdemeanor assault relating to a Florida incident involving a female reporter. A Trump spokeswoman has said Mr. Lewandowski is ""confident that he will be exonerated.""The move also follows Mr. Lewandowski's firing of a Colorado operative, apparently for communicating with Mr. Manafort directly about the delegate race there without first alerting Mr. Lewandowski. The Trump campaign disputed the reason for the Colorado aide's dismissal. The Colorado aide's dismissal was reported by Politico.Mr. Trump announced Mr. Manafort's hiring last month, days after The Wall Street Journal reported the Trump campaign had been outmaneuvered in Louisiana by Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign. Although Mr. Trump won the state, Mr. Cruz is poised to take up to 10 more of its delegates than Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz has also seized five of six slots on three important committees at the Republican National Convention.The Trump campaign was unaware of the situation in Louisiana until it was informed of it by the Journal.In a statement released by the Trump campaign, Mr. Manafort said he would ""secure and protect Mr. Trump's nomination.""""I will be working closely with Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Glassner to ensure Mr. Trump's nomination,"" Mr. Manafort said, referring to the campaign manager and his deputy, Michael Glassner.

""We will not be dictated by the media. We will not be dictated by the special interest groups in Washington, D.C., because we are the people, we have a vote, and what we say will go!""Mr. Burns, the 36-year-old son of a pastor, husband and father of six children, said he's done dozens of rallies for Mr. Trump, passionately defending the candidate on moral and social issues. He is the pastor of the nondenominational Harvest Praise & Worship Center in Easley, S.C.""You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it!"" Mr. Trump posted on Twitter the day after Mr. Burns appeared with him at a March news conference at his private club in Palm Beach, Fla.Mr. Burns publicly defended Mr. Trump last week after he said women who obtain abortions should be punished if the procedure was outlawed. Hours later, Mr. Trump backtracked and said only abortion providers should face repercussions.Mr. Burns was introduced to Mr. Trump last fall by Paula White, apastorat a central Florida megachurch who has known the businessman since at least 2006, when he appeared on her Christian television show.About a week before the Nov. 30 meeting with ministers, Mr. Trump said of a protester from Black Lives Matter who was shown on video being attacked at a Trump rally: ""Maybe he should have been roughed up.""That, in part, prompted an open letter from more than 100 black religious leaders saying, ""Trump's racially inaccurate, insensitive and incendiary rhetoric should give those charged with the care of the spirits and souls of Black people great pause.""Harsher criticism has come from some of Mr. Burns's other colleagues, who suggest he's trying to promote himself and his one-year-old Christian television network on the back of Mr. Trump's success.Mr. Burns rejected the criticism. He said he has never received any compensation from Mr. Trump and has covered his own travel expenses.

Election 2016: Vets' Charities Await Their Cash --- Groups say they have received a fraction of the funds raised at Trump's Iowa event,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779337565?accountid=12768,"More than two months after Donald Trump skipped a Republican debate to hold a fundraiser for veterans, the targeted beneficiaries are still seeing a fraction of the promised money raised from the Republican's charitable foundation and his wealthy friends.A survey by The Wall Street Journal of 19 of the 22 groups originally listed by Mr. Trump's presidential campaign as the prospective recipients of the funds found that they had received roughly $2.4 million of the estimated $6 million in donations the campaign said the event generated. The total received by all of the groups is likely to be more.One organization refused to disclose how much it received, another said it needed to submit more paperwork before a check would be forthcoming, andonedidn't respond to multiple inquiries.All of the groups reported receiving checks from the Donald J. Trump Foundation or associates through the mail, and most arrived in late February in increments of $50,000 or $100,000. Three organizations reported getting smaller donations in March that averaged between $5,000 and $15,000.""Mr. Trump has distributed many of the contributions to a number of worthy organizations, and will continue to do so,"" said Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman.Ms. Hicks declined to break down how much the various groups had received to date or the total distributed from money raised at the Jan. 29 event.A Trump Organization accountant didn't respond to a request for comment.Mr. Trump held the benefit for veterans in Iowa instead of attending a debate hosted by Fox News, after publicly fighting with one of its anchors in a previous debate. Until 2013, Fox News and the Journal were part of the same company.The benefit raised $1.7 million from online contributions, according to information made public at the time. Mr. Trump personally pledged $1 million, and other funds were raised from his wealthy associates.Among them, Phil Ruffin, owner of Treasure Island Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, gave $1 million directly to Mr. Trump's foundation with no strings attached about which groups it benefited.""I know this funding will make a meaningful impact on veterans throughout the country,"" Mr. Ruffin said in statement on Wednesday.The amount raised from the event represents the largest sum the Trump foundation has had to manage. The New York-based foundation made $591,450 in contributions in 2014, according to its most recent tax return, for example.Some individuals whose contributions were part of the $2.4 million responded to Mr. Trump's appeal by giving to veterans groups directly, according to interviews with them or their representatives.Casino magnate Carl Icahn gave $500,000 to two groups, the Green Beret Foundation and the Navy Seal Foundation, an Icahn representative said.Stewart Rahr, a former wholesale drug company owner and Trump associate, also gave $1 million personally to 11 charities from the list, said Steven Burns, a Stewart R. Rahr Foundation director.Nine West founder Jerome Fisher, a friend of Mr. Trump, and Mr. Fisher's son, Marc, gave at least $20,000 to organizations that included Operation Homefront of Massachusetts, according to a spokesman for the charity.Some charities that received funds from the various individuals and foundations said they were confused about whether they were associated with the Trump fundraiser.""It's a little weird,"" said Keith David of the Task Force Dagger Foundation, a Texas group assisting Special Operations Command personnel, who said that he received a $50,000 check from Mr. Rahr's foundation, but remained in the dark for weeks about whether it stemmed from the Trump event.Mr. David said he was recently informed by one of Mr. Trump's representatives that they were connected. ""It looks like it's from a totally separate organization,"" he said.Charity officials said they have quickly put the money to work.""It was like a super-blessing,"" said Cindy Brodie, the director of Partners for Patriots, a Tennessee group that provides service dogs to disabled veterans. The organization was able to expand the number of dogs it is training to about 40 from 10 previously as a result of the funds, Ms. Brodie said.---Ben Kesling contributed to this article.Credit: By Heather Haddon",6/14/16
DNC Says Computers Breached by Russian Government-Linked Hackers; Entire file of opposition research on GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump reported taken,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796314647?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--The Democratic National Committee's computer systems were compromised by hackers linked to the Russian government, in one of the largest known breaches of a U.S. political organization, party officials said Tuesday.Two groups with ties to the Russian intelligence services hacked the party's information-technology infrastructure, said CrowdStrike Inc., a security firm hired by the Democratic Party after the intrusion was discovered. The same groups had previously penetrated unclassified networks at the White House, State Department and U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the firm said.The two entities ""engage in extensive political and economic espionage for the benefit of the government of the Russian Federation and are believed to be closely linked to the Russian government's powerful and highly capable intelligence services,"" wrote Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, in a blog post about the company's response to the incident.One of the hacker groups gained the ability to monitor the DNC's chat and communications systems in the summer of 2015, while the other gained access to DNC research files, including the party's opposition research on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, in April 2016, he said.Russian officials dismissed the finding. ""I completely rule out the possibility of the government or government structures being involved in this,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Presidential campaigns have emerged as top targets for foreign governments in recent years, driven by immense interest in how candidates would treat foreign countries, formulate trade policies, build their transition teams, and appoint to cabinet level positions and ambassadorships.Political organizations also hold large amounts of sensitive information tempting to hackers--on donors, officials in government, internal deliberations, and more, cybersecurity experts say.Unlike corporate computer systems, campaigns tend to be skinflint operations. ""It's so easy, they can't resist temptation,"" said James Lewis, cybersecurity expert and senior vice president and program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""American politics are a chaotic mystery to them, so they're hoping to get lucky and gain a little insight.""Upon discovering the breach, the DNC ejected the intruders and secured the network, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said.""The security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with,"" she said. ""When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately.""The DNC had relatively weak cybersecurity protections considering the scale of interest from foreign adversaries, a person familiar with the matter said. Foreign hackers attacked U.S. presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, so the DNC should have known it would be a target this year as well, this person said.In 2008, for instance, the email systems of Mr. Obama and his rival John McCain were attacked by hackers linked to China. Staffers responsible for cybersecurity on both 2012 presidential campaigns reported frequent, sophisticated intrusion attempts.Cybersecurity officials consider Russian hackers to be among the best in the world, and their breaches often focus on diplomatic or political targets. In 2014, Russian hackers penetrated the State Department's unclassified email system, and it remained locked in on the government server for months. They have also hacked into a White House computer server and stolen President Barack Obama's unclassified schedule.Nathan Hodge and Robert McMillan contributed to this article.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.comCredit: By Byron Tau and Damian Paletta",6/15/16
Election 2016: Trump Eyes Experience --- New role for seasoned adviser Manafort may tilt campaign in more traditional direction,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779610123?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsRussia's 2014 invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine was spurred by Ukrainian protests in 2013 and 2014; the Orange Revolution in Ukraine took place in 2004-05. An Election 2016 article Saturday about Paul Manafort, an adviser to Donald Trump, incorrectly said the invasion was spurred by the 2013 Orange Revolution.(WSJ April 13, 2016)After more than a year of running his antiestablishment presidential campaign on instincts and television appearances, Donald Trump this week ceded some control to an adviser deeply embedded in the Republican firmament.Paul Manafort, who has worked for Republican presidential candidates dating back to Gerald Ford in 1976, was announced as Mr. Trump's ""convention manager,"" though his role is far more expansive than his title appears.Since joining the campaign last month, Mr. Manafort, 66 years old, has expanded his portfolio to include virtually all aspects of the campaign except for Mr. Trump's events, which will remain under the auspices of Corey Lewandowski, the embattled campaign manager.The campaign has seen internal clashes between Messrs. Manafort and Lewandowski in recent weeks, according to people familiar with its operations. The tension peaked when Mr. Lewandowski, who has been charged with misdemeanor assault for an incident with a female reporter in Florida, fired a Colorado operative who communicated directly with Mr. Manafort without first alerting Mr. Lewandowski, who outranked him before the latest shuffle.Now, as Mr. Manafort said in a Friday interview on CNN, he is outranked only by Mr. Trump. ""I work directly for the boss,"" he said. Mr. Lewandowski didn't respond to requests for comment.Mr. Manafort said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday that the tension between him and Mr. Lewandowski had been overdramatized and the two are speaking daily and working together better as they are getting to know each other.He expects to steer Mr. Trump toward more traditional campaign elements such as speeches, coordinated messaging and talking points for surrogates, who to this point have been given no coordinated guidance from the campaign, he said.""The nomination process has reached a point that requires someone familiar with the complexities involved in the final stages,"" Mr. Trump said in a statement released by his campaign. ""Paul is a well-respected expert in this regard and we are pleased to have him join the efforts to Make America Great Again.""For a candidate who has long bragged about his aversion to traditional political protocol -- he does no polling, little advertising and employs relatively few field operatives -- Mr. Manafort represents a shift toward professionalism.""It's a smart move on Donald's part,"" said 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, for whom Mr. Manafort was a top convention aide. ""He has the experience and that's what he does, he does conventions. He hunts for delegates.""What's less clear is if Mr. Manafort's talents are being harnessed too late. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has a monthslong head start on establishing a sophisticated operation to wrangle delegates.""It's very late in the game to help him corral the nomination,"" said Fred Malek, a Republican fundraiser.Mr. Trump first added Mr. Manafort to the campaign last month, at the urging of longtime political adviser Roger Stone, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Cruz was poised to take 10 more delegates than the New York businessman from Louisiana -- even though Mr. Trump won the state's March 5 primary.Mr. Manafort said revelations of the Cruz campaign's ability to secure delegates in Louisiana served as an example of a needed wake-up call to upgrade Mr. Trump's campaign operation. ""Louisiana helped to put the exclamation point at the end of the sentence,"" Mr. Manafort said.Mr. Manafort, who with his staff will be based in Washington while the rest of the campaign is headquartered at Trump Tower in New York, is charged with protecting the front-runner's delegate advantage and ensuring he acquires the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the nomination.Mr. Trump must win about 70% of the outstanding bound delegates to reach the nomination threshold before the Republican National Convention in July. The last time a GOP nomination was in doubt before the party's convention was 1976, when Mr. Manafort helped Mr. Ford fend off a challenge from Mr. Reagan.In the late 1980s, Mr. Manafort and other associates at his Washington lobbying firm -- which counted as a client the Trump Organization, the candidate's business -- were the subject of a federal investigation into allegations that they steered U.S. housing subsidies to developers. Mr. Manafort admitted that he used ""influence peddling"" to get a New Jersey housing project approved with the Reagan administration. He told a House subcommittee that he did nothing illegal, and the firm was later sold.Mr. Trump isn't Mr. Manafort's first unorthodox political client. His international clients have included former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian president and Vladimir Putin ally ousted in the 2013 Orange Revolution that ultimately led to Russia's invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine.Credit: By Heather Haddon and Reid J.

A Trade Lesson in Trump Scarves,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779610096?accountid=12768,"We'll admit to smiling this week when a Consumer Product Safety Commission press release crossed our desk, warning that Ivanka Trump-branded lines of scarves are being recalled for violating federal flammability standards. The 100%-rayon products, which the agency says pose a ""severe burn risk,"" were made in China.Thankfully no one has been injured by these combustible accessories, though a question is whether Donald Trump and his family partners will ever be burned by voters for the disjunction between his political rhetoric and business practices. The same day as the recall, the candidate assailed Ford's $1.6 billion investment in a Mexican auto plant as ""an absolute disgrace.""If Mr. Trump promises to restore American jobs supposedly lost to competition abroad, he's unrepentant about offshoring his signature ties and Ms. Trump's shoes and dresses. Foreigners, he said last month, ""make it impossible for clothing makers in this country to do clothing in this country. And if you look at what's happened on Seventh Avenue, and you look at what's happened in New York with the garment industry, so much of the clothing now comes out from Vietnam, China and other places.""We won't begrudge a guy for trying to make a buck, nor for adapting to the realities of integrated global supply chains. And it's fair to wonder if the Trumps are being shaken down by Democratic regulators. But a spokesperson for Ivanka Trump Collection wrote in an email that they were ""disappointed to learn of the need for Global Brands Group, our license partner, to recall two styles of Ivanka Trump scarves, but we are relieved that immediate action is being taken.""Therein lies an irony or two. Despite what Mr. Trump has heard on Seventh Avenue, the apparel industry is starting to return to America -- and one reason is superior quality control.Cheap Chinese labor led a 1990s-era garment exodus. But automation, robotics and a more comparatively productive workforce now mean U.S.-based textile shops can make better, more reliable goods. The costs mostly break even, especially as overseas wages rise, and shorter, more flexible U.S. lead times can turn around ""fast fashion"" to keep up with trends. This apparel ""reshoring"" is nascent, but retailers seeking a competitive domestic edge include Zara, New Balance, Brooks Brothers, Saks and many boutique labels.The U.S. textile industry is also adding jobs for the first time in decades, albeit not in the kinds of textiles that are made into scarves. Technology for advanced materials -- fabrics that are ultra lightweight or strong or flame resistant (ahem); that conduct electricity or contain digital sensors or even synthetic biological tissue -- are revolutionizing manufacturing. Specialty textile exports have increased 39% since the recession.These are the high-value jobs that will power the modern economy, not the low-skill, low-pay assembly lines of Mr. Trump's political myth. But if he does want to bring back the old days, then it's not ""impossible"" for him to start with his business model -- if only to protect public safety from his neckwear.",6/15/16
Election 2016: California Presents Challenge for Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793709053?accountid=12768,"REDDING, Calif. -- Donald Trump says he wants to become the first GOP presidential candidate in a generation to win California, but he faces a steep climb in the liberal, ethnically diverse state where he trails Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by double-digit margins.Mr. Trump this past week held California campaign rallies in advance of the state's June 7 primary, even though the Republican outcome is a foregone conclusion now that he has cleared the field of all rivals.""They always give up in California as a Republican, because they say you can't win,"" Mr. Trump said at a rally in Redding on Friday. ""I think we can win.""Mr. Trump's travels provide opportunities to raise money from the state's deep-pocketed donors, road-test his campaign operation and activate his base.""This is part of building our volunteer and support base,"" said Tim Clark, Mr. Trump's California campaign director.Mr. Trump has said he wants to contest a number of states Republicans have lost since the 1980s, including Oregon and New York. Yet California is probably the longest shot among his targets. The latest Wall Street Journal/Marist/NBC News poll of California found that Mrs. Clinton outpolls him 55%-31%; her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, beats Mr. Trump 62%-28%.No GOP presidential candidate has won the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Since then, the statewide political terrain has become more inhospitable. The Republican National Committee, upon which Mr. Trump intends to rely heavily for help in the general election, doesn't even have a state director in California.California's population is nearly 40% Hispanic, a group among which Mr. Trump is especially unpopular because of his anti-immigration rhetoric. A serious statewide campaign could cost tens of millions of dollars.""It's almost impossible to see a way in which Trump becomes competitive in California, no matter how much money he spends here,"" said Dan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst who was communications director for John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign.Still, Mr. Trump's celebrity and knack for grabbing media attention gives him a unique advantage over other Republican presidential candidates: He doesn't have to spend the millions of dollars others have to establish their identities and make an impression.Mike Madrid, a GOP political consultant who is an expert on Latino voting trends, said the state's political tilt and demographics are obstacles, but that he has learned, while watching Mr. Trump's rise, to never say never.""From a numbers standpoint, it looks mathematically impossible,"" said Mr. Madrid of Mr. Trump's ability to win California. ""But it was also mathematically impossible for an African-American to become president.""California's campaign-spending record was set in the 2010 governor's race when GOP candidate Meg Whitman raised $177 million -- and lost to Democrat Jerry Brown by 54%-41%.""When you have an in-the-box Republican, spending $100 million is not enough,"" said Tony Strickland, a former California state senator who is heading a pro-Trump super PAC. ""But here we have a candidate who has 100% name I.D. and can get on TV and get a message out"" without spending a lot of money.In 1990, the census found the Hispanic share of California's population was 25.8%. In 2014, it was 38.6% and surpassed the share of the white population. Democrats have been the primary political beneficiaries of that demographic shift.Tayde Aburto, a Mexican immigrant in San Diego who is president of the Hispanic Chamber of E-Commerce, is trying to organize anti-Trump opposition among Hispanics. ""I see no path to victory for Donald Trump in California,"" Mr. Aburto said.Credit: By Janet Hook",6/17/16
Trump's Commander-in-Chief Test,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793708780?accountid=12768,"The general election has arrived, and the tone will not be more elevated than in the primaries. Hillary Clinton opened a coruscating attack on Donald Trump's foreign-policy credibility on Thursday, and despite her own weak record, the Republican will need a better response than he's mustered.Mrs. Clinton has identified Mr. Trump's greatest liability, which is the Commander-in-Chief test. Americans expect their Presidents to possess some knowledge about the world and the coolness and intellectual gravity to manage its problems, or try to. Mrs. Clinton will argue through November that Mr. Trump fails to meet these minimum standards.The Democrat said Mr. Trump was ""temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility""; his ideas are ""dangerously incoherent""; and all but described a Trump Presidency as an extinction-level event. Her attack scored some points because Mrs. Clinton merely had to quote Mr. Trump's own words.The businessman really did suggest that Saudi Arabia and South Korea should be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons: ""If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy yourself, folks."" He has often seemed to sympathize with or praised dictators like Vladimir Putin, he did say that ""maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS,"" and he did claim to be his own best foreign-policy adviser because ""I have a very good brain.""Mr. Trump is impulsive and improvisational. In his one prepared speech on world affairs he called for the U.S. to be more ""unpredictable,"" and he prides himself as a ""counter-puncher."" These personal qualities may have served him well in business, but they won't be strengths when dealing with foreign leaders or making national-security decisions. Recklessness is not a good look for a President.Mr. Trump first responded to Mrs. Clinton with a Twitter tirade, assailing a ""Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!"" At a San Jose rally Thursday night, he added that her speech was a ""hit job"" that ""had nothing to do with foreign policy.""Mr. Trump's insult politics succeeded in the GOP primaries, but now he must appeal to a far larger general-election audience. Mr. Trump could answer Mrs. Clinton by prosecuting a more sustained case, with tangible examples, against President Obama's conduct overseas. Mrs. Clinton as Secretary of State was a key first-term architect who bears some responsibility for the tide of global disorder and proliferating threats to U.S. security and interests.The rise of authoritarian powers on the Obama-Clinton watch includes China in the Western Pacific, Russia in Europe and Iran in the Middle East. All are bidding to become regional hegemons, and they've made substantial gains amid Mr. Obama's global retreat.The Obama-Clinton team overthrew Moammar Gadhafi in Libya but then did nearly nothing to restore public safety. Even discounting the terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, this indifference has allowed ISIS to establish a beachhead in North Africa.Speaking of which, the failure to intervene in Syria has created what former CIA Director David Petraeus calls ""a geopolitical Chernobyl."" Along with the total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, which Mrs. Clinton championed, this abdication has created the space for Islamic State to thrive and swamped Europe with refugees.ISIS did not exist when Mr. Obama took office, and Mr. Trump could gain an advantage by proposing a better strategy to defeat the jihadists. The FBI estimates that ""thousands"" of Americans may have been radicalized online or overseas, and they could soon perpetrate more attacks akin to Paris, Brussels or San Bernardino.The problem for Mr. Trump in making that case is that he shares many of the same instincts as Mr. Obama about the limits of U.S. international engagement. The businessman's ""America First"" philosophy allows Mrs. Clinton to make a contrast with platitudes like ""we need to stick with our allies"" -- because he has in fact promised to rethink core alliances like NATO.Mrs. Clinton is promoting a center-left version of the pre-Obama internationalist consensus about the exercise of U.S. power and influence. She even invoked American exceptionalism as an ideal. Recall Mr. Obama in 2009 saying ""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.""An optimistic view of America's leadership role in the world has in the past demonstrated broad electoral appeal. Mr. Trump's challenge is not merely to convince voters to take a risk on his candidacy, but to explain why his worldview is superior and will produce better results than Mr. Obama's.",6/17/16
Election 2016: Trump Looks For Big Win In New York,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781723632?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump closed his New York campaign with a rally in Buffalo billed as one of his biggest indoor events, a show of strength reflecting his ambition to notch a home-state landslide on Tuesday and the GOP nomination by June.Monday's rally, which drew an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 people, was also a show of defiance at a time when his leading rival in the GOP race, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, has demonstrated he can win over delegates in contests that reward organizational flair over mass appeal, boosting the chances of a contested Republican convention.Polls show Mr. Trump in reach of winning all 95 of New York's delegates, a sweep that would enhance his chances of clinching the nomination before the July convention. The real-estate developer has repeatedly bashed party rules that have allowed Mr. Cruz to elect loyal delegates in states won by Mr. Trump. Those pro-Cruz delegates could deprive Mr. Trump of victory at a contested convention.At the Buffalo rally, Mr. Trump repeated what has become the central message of his New York campaign: taunting Mr. Cruz for criticizing his ""New York values"" at a debate earlier this year. Mr. Trump defined such values as straight talk, work ethic, and resilience after the Sept. 11 attacks.""We're going to show Ted Cruz, who hates New York,"" Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd at the First Niagara Center, adding Mr. Cruz had voted against federal aid after superstorm Sandy. ""No New Yorker can vote for Ted Cruz.""The Trump campaign said the candidate's largest indoor rally before Monday was in September in Dallas, where the crowd was estimated at 15,000, according to media reports. An August outdoor rally in Mobile, Ala., drew an estimated 30,000 people.Mr. Cruz left New York City Monday to campaign in Maryland before returning to the city for a fundraiser, and was set to appear Tuesday in Pennsylvania, which like Maryland holds it primary on April 26.Asked in an interview with ABC if he knew his ""values"" comment had hurt him, Mr. Cruz said he got the phrase from Mr. Trump and blamed one of his favorite targets. ""I do know that it has hurt me with the media,"" he said.Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is running second in the New York polls, headlined two town-hall meetings upstate Monday as he sought to siphon delegates from Mr. Trump. He also promoted an endorsement from the great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, whose Oyster Bay, N.Y., home he visited recently. ""He is by far the best-qualified Republican candidate and the only one who could win the general election,"" Theodore Roosevelt IV said.Any delegate pickups on Mr. Trump's home turf would help the governor defend his strategy of beating both rivals at a contested convention despite lagging in primary votes. But in a sign Mr. Kasich doesn't expect big gains Tuesday, he planned to campaign in Pennsylvania and Maryland before the New York polls close.Mr. Trump could win all of the delegates Tuesday if he receives more than 50% support in 27 congressional districts.""This is going to be a runaway primary in New York -- it's just a question if we hit 50% everywhere. But it will set us on the path to the nomination,"" said Rep. Chris Collins in New York, one of only a few lawmakers on Capitol Hill to endorse Mr. Trump.Earlier Monday, Mr. Trump pushed back at allegations of racial and religious bias, citing an endorsement from a group of African-American, Sikh and Muslim supporters called the National Diversity Coalition. Mr. Trump appeared with the group in front of his offices and met with them privately.""He's best for America and he's certainly the best for the minority community,"" said Steve Parson, a Virginia pastor who attended the event at Trump Tower.Mr. Trump attracts protesters to nearly all of his events who condemn his proposal to bar Muslim immigrants from the U.S. and his description of Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers.Mr. Cruz's schedule Monday reflected his light footprint in New York, where the evangelical Christians and social conservatives who have fueled his victories are less influential. He met with supporters, raised money behind closed doors and participated in television interviews. In one, he spoke of beating Mr. Trump at state party meetings in Wyoming, Colorado and North Dakota where the convention delegates are elected.""We have won five in a row, and Donald's upset, so he's throwing a fit,"" he told ABC.Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Heather Haddon",6/17/16
Trump's Bully Pulpit,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781723443?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump says he wants to unite the Republican Party, but he keeps acting as if he's mounting a hostile takeover. He's now threatening to blow up the party's July convention because he and his campaign were too lazy or inept to understand the 50 state nomination rules.That's the story behind Mr. Trump's complaints that the party's nominating rules are ""rigged"" against him. ""It's a crooked system. It's 100% corrupt,"" the front-runner howled on Sunday following a Friday op-ed on these pages making the same claims. He added on Sunday that he hopes a contested GOP convention in July ""doesn't involve violence."" Thanks for the warning.Mr. Trump is upset that he's being outhustled in winning delegates, and that he may fall short of the 1,237 he needs to win a majority in July. His latest embarrassment came at the Wyoming state convention on Saturday as Ted Cruz won the 14 delegates up for grabs. Mr. Cruz was the only candidate to show up in Casper, where he added to the nine (of 12 available) delegates awarded last month at county meetings. Mr. Trump, who said he didn't want to ""waste money going to Wyoming,"" now claims Mr. Cruz won thanks to ""party bosses.""This is the same line the New Yorker leveled at the Colorado GOP, which also uses county and state conventions (rather than a popular vote) to elect delegates, and which recently awarded Mr. Cruz a delegate sweep. Yet both state processes were transparent and well known to all campaigns since last year.In Wyoming's case, ""every presidential candidate for the last 40 years has managed this process and has worked through this process and has followed the process,"" state GOP Chairman Matt Micheli told Fox News. Having failed to organize well enough to compete on these open terms, Mr. Trump is inventing complaints that such caucuses are ""voterless.""Any registered Republican in Wyoming was welcome to vote for delegates at the precinct caucuses -- which kicked off the wider state nomination process -- and many did. GOP turnout on Super Tuesday in places like Laramie County was up some 400%. It's true these caucuses favor partisans willing to participate, but that's true of caucuses and primaries in every state. Even with this year's high voter turnout, most primaries are being decided by at most 30% of registered Republicans. Does that make Mr. Trump's victories in South Carolina or Florida less legitimate?Mr. Trump has arguably benefitted more than other candidates from the GOP's delegate-selection system. He has won about 37% of all votes cast yet he has won closer to 45% of the delegates. That's due to his success in states that award delegates on a winner-take-all or winner-take-most basis. States that allocate delegates proportionally better reflect actual vote totals, but you don't hear Mr. Trump complaining about that.Then there's Mr. Trump's gripe that delegates pledged to him (or to former candidates) may desert him after the first convention ballot. These state rules are also longstanding and transparent. The party has to nominate someone, and the point of unbinding delegates is to let a party majority coalesce around a nominee, rather than sit in permanent deadlock.None of this would even be a problem if Mr. Trump were consolidating GOP support like previous front-runners at this stage of the nomination race. He's likely to win easily in his home state of New York on Tuesday, but his threats and bullying have also hardened opposition to his candidacy. His real problem is that millions of Republicans increasingly fear he'd lose in a November landslide.According to the latest WSJ poll of registered voters, an astounding 65% of the public have an unfavorable view of Mr. Trump. Subtract the 24% who like him, and his net unfavorable rating is minus 41%. That's lower even than Hillary Clinton, who has a net unfavorable of minus 24%. Mr. Cruz is at minus 23%.Candidates who are disliked by two-thirds of the public tend to lose elections, and Mr. Trump has shown little capacity for -- or even much interest in -- improving his image. This is the real reason he may lose the nomination in Cleveland if he can't win on the first ballot.Members of the Republican National Committee are meeting in Florida this week, and Mr. Trump is badgering them to change the rules to let him win with a plurality of delegates. The party shouldn't give in to his intimidation. The GOP is a private institution whose purpose is to nominate a candidate who can win an election to further party ideals. If a candidate like Mr. Trump can't win a party majority, he has no chance at winning a majority of the country in November.",6/17/16
Sanders Supporters Seek Ways to Keep 'Bernie' Movement Alive; Election presents choice they had hoped to avoid: Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797778572?accountid=12768,"CHICAGO--Liberal activists behind Bernie Sanders's campaign held a weekend conference to commiserate over his loss to Hillary Clinton and plot ways to keep the ""Bernie"" movement alive now that the candidate is exiting the presidential stage.In their view, the general election presents a painful choice: Mrs. Clinton or presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Dominique Scott, a University of Mississippi student, got a standing ovation at a panel discussion Saturday when she described her predicament as a first-time voter in a presidential race. ""I'm so discouraged about the moment we're in right now,"" Ms. Scott said. ""I am distraught that the two choices that I get are two people who do not represent me and do not represent the things that I need.""While some Sanders supporters are rallying around the presumptive Democratic nominee--including the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor coalition--resistance from his most ardent backers threatens to split the party ahead of the showdown with Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders wasn't at the conference dubbed ""The People's Summit."" But the Vermont senator was everywhere all the same. Millennials walked through the halls wearing T-shirts bearing sketches of his receding hairline. In panels, participants dissected the campaign's rise and fall and talked wistfully about how close Mr. Sanders came to vanquishing Mrs. Clinton. Piped in over loudspeakers was a song capturing the mood: the Beatles' ""Revolution.""The conference's lead organizer was National Nurses United, an ally that dispatched a customized bus to various primary states rallying the Sanders faithful. Among the 3,000 attendees were assorted socialists, union officials, community organizers and college students. Together, they represent the wing of the Sanders coalition that is the least enthused about coalescing behind the Clinton campaign.""It's a terrible place we find ourselves in,"" said Becky Bond, a former adviser to Mr. Sanders's campaign, in a session titled ""Understanding our Movement Moment."" The best a Clinton presidency would produce is a nation ""slightly worse than it is under Obama,"" Ms. Bond said.What worries some at the conference is the fate of Mr. Sanders's email list. They want him to keep it away from the Clinton campaign. Seeing the list as a coveted asset, his supporters want Mr. Sanders to use it to promote like-minded candidates. Clinton aides have other ideas; they want him to use the list to tout her candidacy. Rosario Dawson, an actress who campaigned for Mr. Sanders and attended the conference, said in an interview she has no use for any pro-Clinton messages crossing her cellphone: ""If she wants our vote, then she needs to go get it,"" she said. ""We didn't register to vote and phone bank and canvass for her for a reason.""A theme of the conference is that the movement that propelled Mr. Sanders doesn't need him to endure. The victories he notched in 23 contests demonstrate a public appetite for the liberal solutions he put forward, participants said.A new goal, they said, is finding a fresh crop of candidates who will push for the policy changes Mr. Sanders championed, including a government-run health-care system and free tuition at public colleges.Mr. Sanders shares that aim. In his online address on Thursday, he urged his supporters to run for elective office and reverse a tide of Republican victories at the state and local level. His campaign said that within 24 hours of the speech, nearly 7,000 people signed up on his website to get more information.The conference attendees see the Democratic Party as an obstacle to the sort of candidate recruitment they believe is necessary. Many would like to have a new party emerge, believing the current leadership incapable of closing the gap between rich and poor.Mr. Sanders, too, wants changes in the way the party does business and has called for the ouster of the chairwoman, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Nina Turner, a Sanders supporter and former Ohio state senator, said that even though she has been a lifelong Democrat, ""a third party might not be bad for this country.""""Let's shake it up,"" Ms. Turner said. ""I want to see the Democratic Party live up to our values.""As for the question on everyone's mind--what to do in the general election--one speaker offered a piece of advice. Work for a Clinton victory if you must, but never stop pushing for sweeping policy changes, said Tobita Chow, chairman of a Chicago-based political group called ""The People's Lobby.""""If you're going to spend the next five months volunteering for the Clinton campaign and phone-banking for her, you're not building anything. You're not building this movement. That's five months of wasted time,"" Mr. Chow said.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comCredit: By Peter Nicholas",6/20/16
Trump's Delegate Whine,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780137118?accountid=12768,"As the prospect of a contested Republican presidential convention increases, so does the brawling over delegates -- and the whining from the losers. If someone decides to run for President, is it too much to ask that he or his campaign managers understand the nominating rules?""The system is rigged, it's crooked,"" Donald Trump said Monday on Fox News, with his usual understatement, after Ted Cruz won 34 GOP delegates in Colorado while Mr. Trump was shut out. ""The people out there are going crazy, in the Denver area and Colorado itself, and they're going absolutely crazy because they weren't given a vote. This was given by politicians. It's a crooked deal."" The truth is that he lost due to his own campaign's ineptitude.The state politicians in Colorado did exactly what they are entitled to do under Republican Party rules: set up a process that allocates delegates to candidates in any way a state party sees fit. Most state parties nowadays hold primary or caucus elections, but some do so with a hybrid system that can seem convoluted but makes sense if the goal is to build a party of volunteers from the ground up.Colorado awarded delegates through a caucus process that began with precinct meetings and moved to congressional district and state GOP conventions. The attendees at those conventions then voted to elect the delegates to the national convention, and Mr. Cruz won 30 delegates that will be pledged to him on the first ballot. Another four are free agents but say they prefer Mr. Cruz. Three others are state party leaders who are free to vote as they please.None of this was ""crooked."" Mr. Trump is claiming the process was rigged because the Colorado GOP cancelled its usual straw poll held on Super Tuesday (March 15 this year). But the state party made that decision last August because such a poll would have been binding under new national GOP rules, and the Colorado party wanted its delegates to be free to support the candidate they liked in what was then a crowded field. The decision wasn't aimed at Mr. Trump.Mr. Cruz cleaned up in Colorado because his campaign was paying attention to the process. Whatever one thinks of the Texan's appeal as a candidate, his campaign is organized and focused on winning the required 1,237 delegate majority. This speaks well of his ability to lead a complex organization.The Trump campaign's delegate-counting blunders show the downside of running a one-man show from a Boeing 757. Mr. Trump famously disdained the trappings of conventional campaigns, banking on mass rallies and free media. That has worked well in primaries, especially open primaries when Democrats and independents can vote for GOP candidates.But Mr. Trump hasn't taken the time to understand how the GOP's state parties work, and he's now paying the price as delegates are chosen. The New Yorker has admitted his mistake by hiring Paul Manafort, a GOP Beltway fixer, to focus on delegate selection and maybe manage the campaign. It's hard to know who's doing what in the Trump Circus with all the leaks about in-fighting since his loss in Wisconsin.---The larger point is that none of this is undemocratic or dishonest. A political party exists to nominate candidates to run for election with the goal of winning. Political parties are private entities independent of government and can set up the nominating process any way they want. Candidates are obliged to follow party rules, not vice versa.This principle has been legally endorsed by no less than the U.S. Supreme Court in a 2008 opinion by the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, as our friends at the New York Sun reminded us on Monday. A reform-minded judge, Margarita Lopez-Torres, sued after she was denied a Democratic nomination to run for the New York Supreme Court.Justice Scalia rejected her claim for a unanimous Court, writing in New York State Board of Elections v. Lopez Torres that, ""A political party has a First Amendment right to limit its membership as it wishes, and to choose a candidate-selection process that will in its view produce the nominee who best represents its political platform."" He added that ""party conventions, with their attendant 'smoke-filled rooms' and domination by party leaders, have long been an accepted manner of selecting party candidates.""All of this is worth keeping in mind if the GOP does find itself at the first contested convention since 1976. It's democracy at work, and the candidates who want to be President should spend more timing learning the rules and less kvetching on TV.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Party Nominations, Rules and Democracy"" -- WSJ Apr. 19, 2016)",6/21/16
Trump and Clinton Show Strength in New York Poll,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780137090?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton hold double-digit leads in New York and are poised to regain their footing in their home state's primaries next Tuesday, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds.On the Republican side, Mr. Trump holds a 33-point lead over his closest rival, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, 54% to 21%, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz trails both, as the top pick of 18% of likely Republican primary voters.Mrs. Clinton maintains a 14-point lead in the Democratic contest, outpacing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 55% to 41% among likely Democratic primary voters. The former secretary of state's lead is built on strength among women, African-Americans and Democrats age 45 and older.The survey results will be welcome news to the two front-runners, who have both lost ground in recent weeks. Mr. Trump is looking to bounce back from a decisive loss in last week's Wisconsin primary, while Mrs. Clinton has lost eight of the last nine Democratic contests.""Right now, the front-runners look like they will erase recent setbacks and add significantly to their delegate margins,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey. ""New York is not likely to enhance the hopes of those trying to close the gap in the delegate hunt.""Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump remain the clear leaders in their parties nominating contests. Mrs. Clinton has a particularly strong advantage because of her support from her party's so-called superdelegates, the elected officials and other party leaders who have a say in determining the presidential nominee.Mr. Trump is in a tougher spot because he is in a race to collect the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the nomination before the party gathers in Cleveland to determine the nominee. He has so far won 743. A big win in New York would help him reset his campaign narrative, after he surrendered delegates to the Cruz camp at a string of recent state party conventions.On Monday, Mr. Trump, prompted by the result of the Colorado contest in which Mr. Cruz won all 34 delegates, complained that the GOP delegate-selection process, which differs from one state to the next, was established by party bigwigs to prevent political outsiders like him from winning the nomination. ""The system is rigged, it's crooked,"" he said in an interview on Fox News.At the same time, he acknowledged that two of his children won't be able to vote in the New York primary because they missed the registration deadline. ""They feel very, very guilty,"" he said.The Republican contest in New York, like the Democratic race, is limited to voters who have registered with the party.Mr. Trump leads his two remaining rivals by at least a two-to-one margin among just about every demographic group in the New York electorate, among them women, college graduates and those primary voters who practice a religion -- three groups with which he often struggles.New York will award 95 Republican delegates next Tuesday. A candidate can win all of the delegates from any given congressional district if he eclipses the 50% mark.Mr. Cruz entered the New York contest riding high, following his convincing win in Wisconsin last week. But he is struggling to get a foothold in the Empire State, a difficulty attributed in part to his attack on what he called Mr. Trump's ""New York values"" earlier in the primary cycle. The senator defended those remarks last week, telling reporters he was referring to the ""values of liberal Democratic politicians.""Mr. Cruz spent Monday on the West coast, attending campaign events in California, the last stop on the primary calendar where the remaining contenders will fight over the state's 172 delegates. Mr. Trump can't wrap up the nomination before California and four other states vote June 7.""I'm going to say a sentence that hasn't been said for 50 years,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""California is going to decide the Republican nomination.""At the same stop, the Texas senator taunted Mr. Trump for complaining about the delegate-selection process. ""When people vote against him, they are stealing the election,"" Mr. Cruz said.In the latest poll, New York Republicans were also asked about the biggest question hanging over the GOP contest: What should happen if no candidate enters the convention this summer with a majority of delegates, the threshold for clinching the nomination.A large majority -- 64% -- thinks Mr. Trump should win the nomination if he has the most delegates, even if he falls short of a majority, the poll found.If Mr. Trump doesn't win the nomination, most primary voters also said they would oppose any effort to crown someone who didn't run for president this year, throwing cold water on speculation that party leaders should nominate House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) or some other Republican who sidestepped the primary. Some 59% said the nominee should be someone who ran in the primaries, while 32% said it would be acceptable to have a nominee who didn't.The Democratic primary in New York is showing voting patterns familiar from prior contests, with independents, liberals and younger voters lining up behind Mr. Sanders, and Mrs. Clinton dominating among self-described Democrats and other traditional constituencies. Mrs. Clinton, who was twice elected to represent the state in the U.S. Senate, has a big advantage in New York City and the surrounding suburbs, while the race is effectively deadlocked upstate.In what could be troubling trends for Mrs. Clinton in the general election, Mr. Sanders owns a slight lead among Latino Democrats, and his supporters are far less likely to back Mrs. Clinton in November than her backers are to support him. Some 30% of Sanders supporters said they wouldn't support Mrs. Clinton if their candidate doesn't win the nomination. By contrast, 15% of Clinton supporters said they wouldn't back Mr. Sanders should he become the nominee.The two Democratic candidates are fighting over 247 delegates in New York.The Journal/NBC News/Marist survey of New York, conducted April 6-10, included 259 likely Republican primary voters and 557 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 6.1 percentage points among GOP voters and 4.2 points among Democrats.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",6/21/16
Election 2016: Inside Trump University's Course Shift,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780086680?accountid=12768,"In 2005, John Vogel, an adjunct professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, stood at a news conference with Donald Trump and professors from other top-ranked schools to announce the launch of Trump University.He was proud of the video lectures he recorded on topics such as variable versus fixed-rate mortgages and how to weigh pros and cons of different properties for an online course directed at would-be real-estate investors.""There were some pretty legitimate people involved at the beginning,"" said Mr. Vogel, who earned $1,800 for a day's work recording the sessions.But according to former employees and a number of the early instructors who flanked the businessman and reality-television starat the event, the program all but ditched its online courses and Ivy League instructors by mid-2007 to focus on seminars teaching how to make it big in the business with little upfront investment.Aspiring real estate magnates could attend free preview sessions, then were encouraged to pay for increasingly expensive seminars and one-on-one coaching that promised to unlock the secrets to success. The company hosted hundreds of multiday seminars -- including 21 in Los Angeles and 18 in New York -- from 2007 to 2010, according to student surveys it posted online.""Had I realized they were going to change course from providing high-quality online education to something that was closer to a boiler room operation and these 'how to get rich' seminars, I never would have gotten involved,"" Mr. Vogel said.Now Mr. Trump and Trump University are defendants in multiple lawsuits, including one by the New York attorney general alleging the school bilked students out of a collective $40 million. The suit may go to trial later this year.Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, has said he will fight the New York suit and pointed to high marks on student satisfaction surveys. ""I could've settled this suit numerous times. Could settle it now. But I don't like settling suits because when you settle lawsuits everybody sues you,"" he said at an Arkansas rally in February, a sentiment he has repeated.A representative for Mr. Trump declined to comment; the former president of Trump University, Michael Sexton, didn't respond to requests for comment.Jack Kaplan, a Columbia Business School adjunct professor who helped create the original entrepreneurship class, said he was ""dismayed"" to hear about the fraud allegations. ""I feel there was, originally, a real opportunity for small businesses,"" he said.Before the shift to the seminar approach, Trump University seemed to have ambitions of blazing a trail in online education. One early recruit was Roger Schank, a former Yale University and Northwestern University professor considered a leader in online course design who took the title of chief learning officer.""I was set up to believe, and this was true for a while, that this was going to be the avant-garde right way to do teaching,"" he said.By late 2006, Mr. Schank said he was told his services were no longer needed after he said he was told the school had used up the $3 million that Mr. Trump was willing to invest. A Trump Organization representative declined to comment on financial figures.There was virtually no overlap between the teachers who created those early online classes and the people who ran the seminars a couple of years later, according to staffers and the online student surveys. Trump University marketing materials continued to claim that the speakers were handpicked by Mr. Trump.In a December 2015 deposition in a suit pending against Trump University in California, Mr. Trump said of his involvement in staffing the seminars, ""I looked at resumes and stuff, but I didn't pick the speakers."" He added later, ""It depends on the definition of what that means, handpicked.""Mr. Sexton, the former Trump University president, said in an affidavit for a separate case that none of the live instructors were chosen directly by the businessman.By mid-2007, according to the student surveys, the school was running three-day seminars in Orlando, Las Vegas, Phoenix and other cities offering advice on how to identify promising investments, types of foreclosures, and some hands-on practice on contacting property owners to discuss an investment.Tad and Cory Lignell were a father-son duo listed as staffers at more than 60 seminars between 2007 and 2009, both together and at separate events. The majority of the appearances were by Cory.Tad Lignell, now 62,said he mainly served Trump University as a mentor for students who bought high-end coaching packages. He said he has invested in ""hundreds"" of properties over the years, and conducts training through other real estate seminar companies.Still he acknowledges having his own scrapes with financial distress. He faced a tax lien in 2006, according to Utah civil court files, and said he had a Las Vegas home foreclosed on a few years later.Cory faced a string of creditors including American Express and collection agencies attempting to reach him, according to court records. He didn't respond to a request for comment.---Heather Haddon contributed to this article.Credit: By Melissa Korn",6/21/16
Trump Tops 'Real New Yorker' Poll,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780086467?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump may not be popular in New York City, but residents across the state believe he is a ""real New Yorker.""The billionaire GOP presidential candidate, who lives on Fifth Avenue and has long dominated the city's tabloid newspapers with his brash style and controversial comments, is viewed as more of a New Yorker than Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Monday.Some 41% of registered voters statewide said Mr. Trump is a ""real New Yorker,"" while 25% said that for Mr. Sanders and 23% for Mrs. Clinton. Six percent said none of the candidates was a real New Yorker, while 5% were unsure, the poll found.Still, Mr. Trump is struggling for support among registered voters in Democratic-heavy New York City. In a hypothetical matchup, Mrs. Clinton beats him 78% to 17% in the five boroughs.When likely Democratic primary voters were asked to choose between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders on the real New Yorker question, 42% chose Mrs. Clinton and 39% picked Mr. Sanders.Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have been trying to play up their New York ties. Mrs. Clinton represented New York in the U.S. Senate for eight years and lives with her husband in Westchester County.

"The Unreasonable Argument Against Trump; Plus, will his former campaign manager get a book deal?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798713578?accountid=12768,"""Is Treasury Secretary Jack Lew trying to impose a new tax burden on all businesses in the United States?,"" asks a Journal editorial . Draft rules presented as a way to prevent corporations from moving overseas are going to create compliance headaches and possible tax increases for businesses that never even considered moving .Morning Editorial ReportClick here to receive this daily Opinion summary via email.Your humble correspondent argues in an op-ed today that the media campaign to label Donald Trump as an authoritarian is absurd. But for those concerned about abuse of power, remember that Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in the race who has refused to cooperate with a federal investigation into her conduct while in office.This week Donald Trump fired his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, but the former aide may not have to wait long for his next payday. We're told that book publishers have been considering whether to bid on a potential memoir from Mr. Lewandowski.Matt Ridley writes that Britain's economy will thrive once it's liberated from the anti-growth European Union . ""A centrally planned, regional customs union--though not one run with a colonial mind-set, chaotic accounts, a bureaucratic surplus and a democratic deficit --might have made some sense in the 1950s. That was before container shipping, budget airlines, the internet and the collapse of tariffs under the World Trade Organization made it as easy to do business with Australia and China as with France and Germany .""""Governments will increasingly pay their bills and expand their spending not with the fruits of the productive labor of taxpayers but by printing money. Inflation is inevitable,"" writes our columnist Holman W. Jenkins, Jr . Looking back at the 1970s, he notes that in that era inflation forced needed reforms . ""The crisis of our own times has not yet become productive, but when and if inflation comes, it will make interest payments on government debts unsupportable . It will cripple the ability of Western governments (and Japan) to make good on promised health-care and pension benefits. There will be no alternative, presumably, except policies aimed at getting economic growth and productivity going again . Presumably.""""Some political incorrectness is refreshing after seven years of Mr. Obama,"" writes Jason Riley . But our contributor says Donald Trump is losing because his comments are at times ""inappropriate"" and also ""juvenile and off-putting.""Whatever the outcome of the U.K.'s Thursday vote on remaining in the European Union, our columnist William Galston says ""an era of Western history is ending and a new one is struggling to be born. The liberal internationalist project of the past seven decades is on the defensive, while ethno-nationalism (often illiberal) is surging .""""The U.S. justice system has increasingly become the court of first resort for foreign lawsuits, which often use broad statutes and the threat of high damages to coerce settlements. The Supreme Court put a brake on that on Monday,"" notes a Journal editorial .Regarding a separate case on criminal evidence resulting from a police stop, another Journal editorial notes that Justice Sonia Sotomayor ""went off the deep end with an extended polemic about police misconduct, events in Ferguson, Mo., and race in America ."" The editorial board notes that her opinion is ""troubling for her insistence on dragging racial politics into a case that had nothing to do with race . This dissent continues her habit of wandering far from the law or precedent to decide cases based on her personal political and policy views .""Also today, MIT's Robert Pozen lauds the SEC for cracking down on companies reporting ""earnings"" after making ""adjustments"" that deviate from generally accepted accounting principles and urges regulators to go further .Credit: By James Freeman",6/22/16
Trump Poses a Dilemma For a Rising GOP Star,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781304756?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- Most anywhere Nicole Malliotakis goes, she gets the question -- in the Staten Island senior center, on the streets of Brooklyn, at her parents' kitchen table.Why aren't you supporting Donald Trump?Earlier this year, Ms. Malliotakis, a 35-year-old New York assemblywoman, was her state's leading backer of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. She openly criticized Mr. Trump's rhetoric against women and Muslims and his past donations to Democrats. In tweets she added: ""#NEVERTRUMP.""Her district, meanwhile, is full of Trump supporters, including her own father. Mr. Rubio has long ago dropped out, and some New York state Republican leaders are urging local politicians to get behind the businessman front-runner ahead of the state's Tuesday primary.The question is a fraught one for Ms. Malliotakis and lawmakers around the country in similar straits, and it poses a challenge unlike most any other in any previous election.If Mr. Trump wins the nomination but loses in November, politicians endorsing him will be saddled with the legacy of his bombast and policies that defy GOP orthodoxy. Not backing Mr. Trump, however, could risk career damage in a state where polls show him poised to win in a landslide.Ms. Malliotakis, who is viewed as a Republican rising star, is dialing back criticism of Mr. Trump. All three GOP candidates or their allies are wooing her ahead of Tuesday vote.""This presidential primary is a minefield, especially for a young person in the spotlight,"" says state Assemblyman Bill Nojay, a Rochester Republican backing Mr. Trump. ""She knows that an endorsement will stick with her.""In New York, Trump endorsements have come from only two of the nine Republicans in Congress and two of the 73 GOP state lawmakers, as well as three county sheriffs, one county clerk and one city councilman. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has won endorsements from about 60 Democratic elected officials in the state.The 31 states that have weighed in on the GOP race are represented by 225 Republicans in Washington. Only two, Tennessee Rep. Scott DesJarlais and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, have endorsed Mr. Trump. All told, Mr. Trump has support from eight House and Senate Republicans and three of 31 GOP governors.""There's a lot of soul searching,"" says state Assemblyman Dean Murray, a Long Island Republican who backed Mr. Rubio and commiserates with Ms. Malliotakis. ""We have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who tease us about what we are going to do, and I don't think they realize how heavy a question that is.""Ms. Malliotakis says she will support the eventual Republican nominee but isn't likely to endorse before Tuesday's primary. ""I'm not one of those politicians who jump on the bandwagon just to be with the winner.""It was an easy decision to back Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, to whom she felt bound as the daughter of parents who came to America from Cuba and Greece. Her mother fled Fidel Castro's 1959 takeover. The communist regime seized the family's gas-station business, instilling them with a distrust of centralized power. Her father worked nights as a waiter while he and her mother started a business importing home decor.Six years ago, she beat a Democratic incumbent in a swing district, which includes parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn. Her constituents are a New York City melting pot: Italians, Russians, Irish; Christians and Mideast Muslims; cops, firefighters, teachers, government employees.She met Mr. Rubio at a fundraiser, where they bonded over their upbringings and conservative values. ""His story is my story,"" she says.She helped him get endorsements in New York and campaigned for him in New Hampshire. When he quit after losing in Florida, she returned to her hotel thinking Mrs. Clinton would likely win in November.Still, Mr. Trump did impress her in 2013 when she and other Republicans met him to discuss a potential gubernatorial campaign. ""He seemed like a reasonable, rational businessman,"" she says, ""not as animated as you see in his rallies or on TV nowadays.""She can relate to Mr. Trump's hostility to party rules, which say if he doesn't win 1,237 delegates by June 7, delegates could back other candidates at a contested convention, a system he calls ""rigged.""Ms. Malliotakis last year sought to succeed U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm after he pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Staten Island's GOP chairman chooses a nominee in such cases and passed on Ms. Malliotakis. ""I don't support making decisions in smoke-filled backrooms,"" she says.At Staten Island's Arrochar Friendship Club, seniors playing Pinochle wave when Ms. Malliotakis walks in recently. Then they start arm-twisting.""He's the only one who I think can stand up to Hillary,"" says 85-year-old Teresa DeSimone of Mr. Trump. Tom Cammarata, 89, says he suspects Ms. Malliotakis likes Mr. Trump but ""I think she's holding back.""One lady isn't a fan: ""Can he tone it down a little?""Ms. Malliotakis replies: ""He needs to.""Pressure comes from all sides, sometimes conflicting. ""A lot of people in my community -- including my father -- are so frustrated and angry and feel that he is the one presidential candidate,"" she says of Mr. Trump, ""who can really shake things up.""Assemblyman Nojay tells her Mr. Trump is the only Republican who can beat Mrs. Clinton in New York, which hasn't gone for the Republican nominee since Ronald Reagan in 1984. He invokes his first advice from Albany's Republican leadership: Vote your district.""We are representatives of our districts, not leaders,"" he says. ""You try to be a leader too often and next election you are going to have a problem.""The Kings County Republican Party leadership in Brooklyn endorsed Mr. Trump and urges local officials to follow. Former Republican gubernatorial nominee Carl Paladino tells New York officials to back Mr. Trump or face constituents' wrath, writing to supporters: ""Not choosing paints you as a coward.""By contrast, Staten Island borough ex-president Guy Molinari says Republican officials should condemn Mr. Trump. ""Donald Trump cannot win the general election,"" he says, ""so if you're a Republican, you have an obligation to your party to speak up.""Ms. Malliotakis likes Ohio Gov. John Kasich's executive experience and steadiness but thinks him soft on illegal immigration. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has good ideas about simplifying taxes, but she disagrees with his defense of the Kentucky clerk who wouldn't grant same-sex marriage licenses.Mr. Trump's focus on curbing illegal immigration makes sense to Ms. Malliotakis, who frames it as enforcing the rule of law. Yet she sees expanding her party beyond its white male base as personal and worries about his unfavorable standing among many women and minorities.Days after Mr. Rubio bowed out, two of Mr. Trump's New York allies sent Ms. Malliotakis flowers with ""deepest condolences."" Last week, she met Mr. Cruz privately in Brooklyn. Hours later, she got a hug from Mr. Kasich after introducing him at a town-hall meeting.Ms. Malliotakis is undecided on how to vote Tuesday. ""There's a large group of us,"" she says, ""who feel like orphans.""Credit: By Beth Reinhard",6/22/16
Election 2016: Trump Still Leads in New York; Kasich 2nd,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781292980?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is poised to run away with this coming week's Republican primary in New York, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC New York/Marist poll shows.The New York businessman leads his closest rival, Ohio Gov. John Kasich by 29 percentage points among likely Republican primary voters, 54% to 25%, the poll finds. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz came in third as the top choice of 16% of likely Republican voters.The results for Mr. Trump mirror a survey released this past week by the Journal, NBC News and Marist that also showed the Republican front-runner with 54% support.The biggest potential development to emerge from the latest batch of data is the emergence of Mr. Kasich as the clear second-place alternative to Mr. Trump.""If there's someone to watch in the closing hours, closing days, it's Kasich,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. He said the Ohio governor seems to owe his rise to Cruz voters, because support for the Texas senator recently has trailed off, while support for Mr. Trump hasn't diminished.With the front-runner holding such a big lead, suspense in the contest focuses more on the size of Mr. Trump's expected winning margin than on whether he will claim victory. He needs to eclipse the 50% threshold in as many of New York's 27 congressional districts as possible to collect most of the state's 95 delegates.The new poll found that support is solid for Mr. Trump in his home state; 70% of his backers say they ""strongly support"" the New York real-estate developer. The support for Mr. Kasich is significantly softer.""Trump's people are pretty baked in,"" Mr. Miringoff said.Among Republican primary voters, Mr. Trump performs slightly better in and around New York City than he does upstate, but he exceeds the 50% mark in both regions. He draws his highest levels of support from Catholics, union households and tea-party supporters, and he performs the worst among Protestants and college graduates.Demographic differences are stark between the two parties in New York.Roughly nine in 10 likely Republican primary voters are white, compared with 55% of Democratic primary voters. The share of younger voters is also much higher in the Democratic primary.And just 13% of Republican primary voters live in New York City, while 61% live upstate.The opposite is true for likely Democratic primary voters, with 51% residing in New York City and 31% upstate.The survey of 313 likely Republican primary voters, conducted April 10 through 13, has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",6/22/16
"REVIEW --- The Next Conservative Movement --- Trump's demagoguery looks back with nostalgia to an America that no longer exists; To revitalize the Republican Party, conservatives need to offer bottom-up solutions that match today's diverse, dynamic social reality",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781292832?accountid=12768,"The American right is in crisis. This year's presidential race, however it turns out, has revealed deep fissures in the Republican coalition. A third to a half of Republican voters in state after state have given their backing to Donald Trump, a divisive demagogue whose case for himself has essentially nothing to do with conservatism. The rest of the party has been left baffled -- wondering what has happened to the Republicans and where American politics might be headed.To answer those questions, we need to see that they are not one and the same. The Trump phenomenon can help us to grasp what has happened but not what is coming next. Mr. Trump marks not the beginning of a new phase in American politics but the end of an old one -- the exhaustion of a mid-20th-century model of national politics that can no longer meet the needs of 21st-century America. Mr. Trump disgorges an angry aggregation of failures and complaints, but he offers no solutions and no way forward.Understanding the roots and appeal of his message can help us to understand how our politics has changed in recent decades. More important, it can help us to see what the constructive next phase of the American right could look like -- a decentralizing conservatism of bottom-up solutions for our increasingly fragmented society.Mr. Trump's core message is often labeled as populist, but it would be better described as mournful or nostalgic. A populist argues that the people are being oppressed by the powerful. But Mr. Trump claims not that our elites or the ""establishment"" are too strong but that they are too weak -- indeed, that the people who hold power and privilege in our leading institutions are pathetic losers and that, therefore, nothing in America works the way it used to and our country ""doesn't win anymore.""This contention taps into a powerful, widely shared sense that the U.S. has lost ground -- that we have fallen far and fast from a peak that many can still remember. Both Democrats and Republicans often appeal to such a sense of loss. For Democrats, the peak came in the 1960s, when cultural liberalization seemed to coexist with a highly regulated economy. For Republicans, it came in the 1980s, when economic liberalization was accompanied by a resurgence of national pride and a renewed emphasis on family values. By now, American politics is largely organized around these related modes of nostalgia, and the two parties address voters as if it were always 1965 or 1981.Much of Mr. Trump's appeal has to do with his even vaguer nostalgic message. He mentions no specific peak to recover and offers little in the way of a policy agenda; he just harks back to a lost American greatness and says that he alone can recapture it by reversing globalization, immigration and other modern trends. And in the process, by impugning Mexicans, Muslims and women, he embraces the ethnic or cultural animosities of some of those who most resent the ways America has changed. He has taken the logic of our nostalgic politics to its absurd conclusion.In its less cartoonish forms, today's nostalgia is understandable. The America that our exhausted, wistful politics so misses, the nation as it first emerged from the Great Depression and World War II and evolved from there, was (at least for its white citizens) exceptionally unified and cohesive. It had an extraordinary confidence in large institutions -- in the ability of big government, big labor and big business to work together to meet national needs. Its cultural life was dominated by a broad traditionalist moral consensus that celebrated two-parent families with children born into wedlock and frowned on divorce and abortion. And in the wake of a world war in which most potential competitors had burned each other's productive capacities to the ground, the U.S. utterly dominated the global economy, offering opportunity to workers of all stripes.But almost immediately after the war, that consolidated nation began a long process of unwinding and fragmenting. During the 1950s, '60s and '70s, the culture liberalized, the economy was deregulated to keep up with rising competitors, and an exceptional midcentury elite consensus in politics gave way to renewed divisions. In time, this fracturing of consensus grew from diffusion into polarization -- of political views, economic opportunities, incomes, family patterns and ways of life. We have grown less conformist but more fragmented, more diverse but less unified, more dynamic but less secure.All this has meant many gains for America: in national prosperity, personal liberty, cultural diversity, racial inclusion, technological innovation and more meaningful options and choices in every realm of life. But it has also meant a loss of faith in institutions, a loss of social order and structure, a loss of cultural cohesion, a loss of security and stability for many workers, and a loss of political and moral consensus. Those losses have piled up in ways that to some Americans now often seem to overwhelm the gains and have made 21st-century American politics distinctly backward-looking and morose.Conservatives and liberals stress different facets of these changes. Liberals treasure the social liberation and growing cultural diversity of the past half-century but lament the economic dislocation, the loss of social solidarity and the rise in inequality. Conservatives celebrate the economic liberalization and dynamism but lament the social instability, moral disorder, cultural breakdown and weakening of fundamental institutions and traditions. Part of Mr. Trump's appeal has been that he basically laments it all -- and thus unites the anxieties of those who see no real upside for themselves in the evolution of modern America.But a politics of angry lamentation, whatever visceral appeal it may have, cannot look forward. America cannot afford a competition of barren nostalgias. We need a politics that builds on our strengths to address our weaknesses.The greatest challenges that America now confronts are the logical conclusions of the path of individualism and fracture, dissolution and liberation that we have traveled since the middle of the last century. And the greatest resources at our disposal for tackling those challenges are the products of our having traveled this path too. We face the problems of a fractured republic, and the solutions we pursue will need to call upon the strengths of a decentralized, diffuse, diverse, dynamic nation.For all the GOP's troubles, it will actually be easier for conservatives than for liberals to see their way toward such a forward-looking politics. For one thing, conservatives can much more clearly see the bankruptcy of a nostalgic politics. Many liberals still cling complacently to the anachronism of social democracy as their vision of the future.Conservatives, especially after this year of pandemonium, can hardly be so smug about their own inherited agenda. But if conservatives can look past their own nostalgia, they will be well positioned to grasp the appeal of a politics of decentralization and diffusion, and thus to offer solutions suited to the society America has become.Some traditional conservative priorities -- especially an emphasis on economic growth -- remain vital to any such forward-looking politics. But that can only be a start. Beyond growth, a modernized conservative policy agenda would seek to use the very diversity and fragmentation of 21st-century America to meet its challenges. By empowering problem-solvers throughout American society, rather than hoping that Washington will get things right, conservatives can bring to public policy the kind of dispersed, incremental, bottom-up approach to progress that increasingly pervades every other part of American life while reviving community and civil society to combat dislocation and isolation.In health care, for instance, the old progressive approach has been to centralize decision-making so that consolidated expertise could direct our immense health-care system more efficiently. Obamacare, like Medicare and Medicaid before it, embodies this approach -- and demonstrates its failings. The new conservative approach would liberate insurers and providers to offer many different models of coverage and care, empower consumers to choose (including through financial assistance to those unable to afford insurance) and let their choices matter -- making the system more efficient from the bottom up.Or consider primary and secondary education, where the old progressive model was the universal public-school system -- offering one product to all and administering it in as centralized a way as public opinion would permit. The new conservative approach would instead direct its resources to let parents make choices for their children and allow the education system to take shape around their priorities and preferences.As these examples suggest, such a bottom-up approach has long been championed by conservatives in some arenas, albeit with limited success against an entrenched progressive welfare state. But as the old progressive model exhausts itself, a new conservative approach can make its case more boldly -- both in familiar arenas and in new ones, from welfare to higher education to local public administration and more.A welfare system that could better address the problems of those left behind by the global economy or mired in intergenerational poverty wouldn't be a one-size-fits-all bureaucratic regime. Rather, it would empower local problem-solvers to mix resources, advice, experience and moral leadership in a continuing process of bottom-up experimentation. State and city welfare agencies will bring different tools to bear than religious charities, local employers or community groups -- and all should be allowed to try. That is what you do when you don't have all the answers.A higher-education system geared to a 21st-century America wouldn't reinforce a cycle of rising tuition and declining value with inflationary federal loans. Instead, it would open up accreditation to allow for more options, let students and parents have more information about outcomes and offer aid to the needy that rewarded high value, not high prices. Some schools (like Purdue University) are experimenting with new models of aid, and some states (like Texas) are leading the way toward lower-cost degrees. Conservatives should make it easier for others to follow.The work of government more broadly -- especially at the state and local levels, where most government happens -- should abandon the model of the centralized, technocratic industrial economy in favor of today's decentralized, consumer-driven, postindustrial economy, using public resources to encourage constructive experimentation with public services rather than to impose tired dogmas from above. Some forward-thinking state and local leaders, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, offer useful models of how competition between private and public service providers can improve both.Such a modernized conservatism would also have much to offer to our troubled cultural debates. In an increasingly fractured society, moral traditionalists should emphasize building cohesive and attractive subcultures, rather than struggling for dominance of the increasingly weakened institutions of the mainstream culture. While some national political battles, especially about religious liberty, will remain essential to preserve the space for moral traditionalism to thrive, social conservatives must increasingly focus on how best to fill that space in their own communities. That is how a traditionalist moral minority can thrive in a diverse America -- by offering itself not as a path back to an old consensus that no longer exists but as an attractive, vibrant alternative to the demoralizing chaos of the permissive society.Indeed, the revival of the mediating institutions of community life is essential to a modernizing conservatism. These institutions -- from families to churches to civic and fraternal associations and labor and business groups -- can help balance dynamism with cohesion and let citizens live out their freedom in practice. They can keep our diversity from devolving into atomism or dangerous cultural, racial and ethnic Balkanization. And they can help us to use our multiplicity to address our modern challenges.In the crisis of this election year, the right has been brought face-to-face with the bankruptcy of its version of nostalgic politics. The conservatism that follows Mr. Trump will need to confront the genuine public concerns into which he has tapped, about trade, downward social mobility and diminished opportunity. But conservatives will need to offer an approach far more constructive than Mr. Trump's vulgar and abusive demagoguery.Conservatives may not feel it just now, but they are actually equipped to take on that challenge, once they see it clearly. The right's decentralizing mind-set, disposition toward community and innate skepticism of technocratic government will serve them well -- and leave them far better equipped to address America's modern problems than liberals who have yet to confront the exhaustion of their own political vision.For the right, Mr. Trump marks the disastrous end of an era. But beyond the crisis that he embodies beckons the prospect of a revitalized conservatism and a revitalized America.---Mr. Levin is the editor of National Affairs and the Hertog Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

Trump Can't Break the Republican Party,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1781292820?accountid=12768,"Republican primary voters and caucus-goers, we have often been told, award their presidential nomination to the candidate next in line. Conservative Christian Republicans are, as one national reporter once wrote (and later apologized for), ""poorly educated and easily led."" Not this year. The normal pattern, to use a word from the Watergate era, is inoperative. Republicans are not supposed to behave like this.Donald Trump's candidacy has proved as disruptive to the Republican Party as Craigslist was to newspapers' classified ads and Uber has been to taxi cartels. It's by no means clear that Mr. Trump will earn the 1,237 delegates needed for the party's presidential nomination. But the Republican Party seems likely to suffer serious damage either if he is nominated (polls show him far behind Hillary Clinton) or if he is not (he predicts violence then and won't rule out an independent candidacy).Some historic perspective may be useful here in assessing how much potential damage the Republican Party may suffer, and if it will be lasting.Each of America's two political parties -- the oldest and third oldest in the world (Britain's Conservatives are No. 2) -- has had a persistently different character; political cartoonists appropriately depict them as two different animals. The Democratic Party, formed in 1832 to re-elect President Andrew Jackson, has always been a coalition of disparate groups -- white Southerners and big-city immigrants in the 19th century, gentry liberals and black church members today. The Republican Party, founded in 1854 to stop the spread of slavery, has always been supported by a core of people who are seen as ordinary Americans -- Protestant Northerners in the 19th century, white married people today -- but who are by themselves not a majority in an always culturally diverse nation.As a result the Democrats have been more often at risk of irreconcilable division. To hold a large and diverse constituency together, the Democratic Party between 1836 and 1932 required nominees to get two-thirds of national convention delegates' votes. Republicans sought unity by control of convention rules and the chairman's gavel, which usually worked for a party with a temperamentally loyal dominant constituency. Unapologetic manipulation of the rules produced the nomination of Dwight Eisenhower over Robert Taft in 1952, the only election year between 1928 and 2004 that produced a Republican president, Senate and House. Gerald Ford's delegate majority over Ronald Reagan in 1976 was narrow, but it held and was respected; Ford nearly won that fall and Reagan did four years later.Serious division over major issues has been relatively rare among Republicans, with arguments usually limited to tactics and timing. But once every generation or so party opinion has been starkly divided. In the 1870s, radical Republicans wanted to pursue Reconstruction to uphold blacks' rights in the South; they lost. In the 1890s, some Republicans favored the gold standard, some inflationary silver; gold won. Twentieth-century Republicans differed in their approach to Progressive and New Deal policies; they pursued different policies in different states. Isolationist and internationalist Republicans argued over foreign policy in the 1930s and 1940s; the internationalists won. In the 1970s, Republicans argued over whether to cut back government and just how; in the 1980s Reagan Republicans won.In each case Republicans argued heatedly, then reached a conclusion and stuck with it. Similarly, as Republicans adjusted to events and opinion, their party shifted from one more supportive of economic intervention in the 19th century to one more opposed in the 20th. The party that was the more cautious about military intervention in the half-century between 1917 and 1967 has become the party less cautious about it in the half-century since. In each case Republicans, operating with a core constituency confident that it embodied much that defines America, emerged with a unified and more politically sustainable position.It is generally agreed that the presidential nomination process is the weakest part of our political system. One reason is that it leaves the two great political parties vulnerable to disruptive candidates -- controversial political figures who threaten to reshape the party to which they have attached themselves.Usually that has happened to the Democratic Party. Beginning in 1896, William Jennings Bryan took a party that had electoral parity with Republicans and led it into extended minority status. Huey Long threatened to hijack Franklin Roosevelt's party in the 1930s. George Wallace disrupted national Democrats to varying degrees in four consecutive elections from 1964 to 1976.Interestingly, the great disrupter this year, Donald Trump, has a background not in Republican but in Democratic politics. His father was entwined with the leadership of the Brooklyn Democratic machine, and the Trump family's timely contributions to a Democratic mayor in 1973 and Democratic governor in 1974 paved the way for his son's initial foray into Manhattan real estate (including a 40-year tax abatement just now expiring).Mr. Trump's jump to first place in polls of Republicans during the 2016 campaign, and to first-place finishes (though no absolute majorities) in 17 party primaries and two caucuses have owed much to tactics no other candidates have seen fit to employ.Denouncing Mexican immigrants as murderers, ridiculing a handicapped reporter, announcing that prisoners of war are not heroes, threatening to ""spill the beans"" on another candidate's wife -- such defiance of political correctness has enabled this celebrity, familiar from 14 years on ""reality"" TV, to get double the news coverage of all his rivals put together. His attacks on policies backed for decades by presidents of both parties -- free-trade agreements, legal immigration, the NATO alliance -- have been met with many cheers and assertions of confidence that this one man, simply by making deals, can ""make America great again.""Many have written about how Republicans' failure to produce policy results their voters expected and yearned for has opened the way for the Trump appeal. So has -- and this also is visible on the Democratic side in the persistent support for Bernie Sanders's candidacy -- a dull sense of discontent after 15 years of mostly sluggish economic growth and unsuccessful foreign military interventions.Republicans have faced a similarly, or even more, disruptive candidate only once in the party's long history: another rich man from New York with an unusual intellect, universal celebrity and a freedom from ordinary political constraints. This was Theodore Roosevelt, who in 1912 challenged his more-or-less handpicked successor William Howard Taft, first for the Republican nomination, and then as a candidate for the newly formed Progressive Party. Roosevelt was the author of some three dozen books, a serious scholar (his naval history of the War of 1812 is still considered definitive) and rugged outdoorsman, a veteran of military combat and a one-time police commissioner in New York City.Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in his case for actually making peace, between Russia and Japan after their 1904-05 war. Succeeding to the presidency after William McKinley was assassinated in September 1901, Roosevelt served for seven years with high job approval and won a full term in 1904 with the highest popular-vote percentage and electoral-vote total of any Republican up to that point. A comparison of his credentials and those of Donald Trump brings to mind Karl Marx's comment, prompted by Napoleon III's coup d'etat, that history tends to repeat itself -- the first time as tragedy and the second as farce.Roosevelt won nine of the Republican Party's 13 recently created presidential primaries in 1912, but the Taft forces held the gavel and the delegate majority and renominated the president. Roosevelt then got the nomination of the new Progressive Party, while Democrats chose Woodrow Wilson, the New Jersey governor and former president of Princeton University. Taft's support flagged and he finished third, with 23% of the popular vote and eight electoral votes; Roosevelt had 27% and 88. So even though the two Republicans got 50% of the popular vote, Wilson won with 42% of the popular vote and 435 electoral votes.For a moment, in the aftermath of Roosevelt's independent campaign, the Republican Party looked to be in danger. Progressive Party candidates won 5% or more of the vote in 216 House races in 1912 and 156 House races in 1916. But the schism was temporary. In 1916 Roosevelt and Taft both supported Republican nominee Charles Evans Hughes, who lost a narrow race -- by 12 electoral votes -- to Wilson. Two years later Republicans won majorities in both houses of Congress. Roosevelt was considered the favorite for the party's 1920 nomination but he died in January 1919, at age 60. The nominee that year, Warren Harding, was elected by the largest popular-vote percentage margin in history, 60%-34%. Roosevelt, the strongest disruptive candidate imaginable, had not permanently disrupted the Republican Party.Still, differences on issues divided Republicans along regional lines in the first half of the 20th century. Heavily German/Scandinavian Upper Midwest states like Wisconsin and Minnesota were isolationist and progressive domestically. Older Midwest states such as Ohio and Indiana were isolationist, antiprogressive and anti-New Deal. Northeastern states were internationalist and more open to big-government policies.Increasing Republican strength in the South and West helped secure the nomination of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Ronald Reagan in 1980. In more recent presidential primaries we have seen divisions between evangelicals and others, and between affluent suburbs and strapped small towns.Those divisions have not been replicated in the response to Donald Trump's disruptive candidacy. It has been noted often that his 37% of primary and caucus votes so far come disproportionately from downscale, non-college-graduate, modest-income voters. But not uniformly. My examination of the results suggests that Mr. Trump's support comes disproportionately from those low in what the scholars Robert Putnam and Charles Murray call social capital or social connectedness -- people who are not likely to participate in civic activities, or regularly attend church or social clubs. Republicans with high social connectedness -- most notably Mormons -- have given Trump very few votes.People of low connectedness seem unlikely to be the basis of a movement to permanently transform the world's third oldest political party. Even if Donald Trump secures the Republican nomination and somehow overcomes current polls to be elected president, there will be few Trump clones among Republicans in Congress and in state and local office.If he is nominated and defeated by a wide margin, he will not leave behind a Trumpist movement with the popular and intellectual depth of the conservative movement following Goldwater's defeat 52 years ago -- his legacy may be little more than an impulse toward opposition to trade agreements and legalization of illegal immigrants. If he is not nominated and tries to run as an independent, he will not have the support of as significant a third-party apparatus as Theodore Roosevelt did 104 years ago.As this is written, it seems likely but not certain that Mr. Trump will fall visibly short of the 1,237-delegate majority, and that he will inflict significant damage on the Republican Party by protests or perhaps an independent candidacy. But probably nothing like the serious, though temporary, damage inflicted by that vastly more talented, experienced and intellectually serious disruptive New Yorker, Theodore Roosevelt.---Mr. Barone, longtime co-author of ""The Almanac of American Politics,"" is the senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner and a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.Credit: By Michael Barone",6/22/16
"Election 2016: Trump, Clintons Strictly Business",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780441376?accountid=12768,"One of the provocative questions in the 2016 presidential race is what dealings Donald Trump and the Clintons had over the years. Were they friends, allies or rivals as Mr. Trump built his fortune and Hillary and Bill Clinton pursued their political ambitions?On Tuesday, the Clinton Presidential Library released about 500 pages of material dating from Mr. Clinton's presidency that offer a few insights into how the Clinton White House saw the business mogul, now the leading Republican presidential candidate.The documents, released in response to a public-records request, provide little evidence of a personal relationship, showing only that the White House had a passing interest in Mr. Trump's business deals and his earlier flirtation with a White House bid.The records include logs of White House holiday cards sent to Mr. Trump, an autographed copy of Mr. Trump's book ""The Art of the Deal"" and news clippings about the businessman's contemplation of a presidential campaign in 1999.Emails from Betty Currie, Mr. Clinton's personal secretary at the White House, show a brief internal discussion about whether to send birthday greetings to Mr. Trump.""What are [your] thoughts on sending a birthday letter to Donald Trump -- who turns 50 on June 14,"" Ms. Currie wrote in a June 1996 email to another White House staffer. ""Please forward response to Maureen Lewis who will prepare letter -- if you approve. Thanks.""A few days later, that plan apparently was scrapped. ""Cancel letter to Donald Trump,"" Ms. Currie wrote.At the White House, Mr. Clinton's aides followed speculation that Mr. Trump might run for president and made sure he was properly briefed on the matter before interviews. The tone of the briefing materials suggests Mr. Trump was seen as less a credible potential candidate than a curiosity.In a memo to Mr. Clinton before a planned TV interview with Bryant Gumbel, aides included a sample question-and-answer involving the political ambitions of Mr. Trump and a few other celebrities.""This year we've been treated to news that Donald Trump, Cybil Shepherd, Jesse Ventura and Warren Beatty might run for president,"" the sample question read. ""Is this the result of a demeaning of the office that you've contributed to?""In a suggested answer, the aides wrote, ""I don't think what I've done has anything to do with such political developments. We go through all sorts of cycles in politics, and we're in one now where some people from the entertainment world are talking about running for president . . ."" When the interview took place, Mr. Gumbel didn't ask about Mr. Trump.A White House diary entry in 2000 records that Mr. Clinton posed for a photo with the businessman at Trump Tower in New York.

Trump's Plan to Win Conservative Support,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1780440440?accountid=12768,"Newt Gingrich has been a friend of Donald Trump's for the past decade. He hasn't endorsed Mr. Trump's presidential bid, but they talk frequently. Mr. Trump is anti-left wing and anti-political correctness, Mr. Gingrich says, while acknowledging this: Mr. Trump is not a conservative.Yet it is conservatives to whom Mr. Trump must appeal as he tries to ""pivot"" -- Mr. Gingrich's term -- to a campaign style that is less chaotic and personality-driven. Mr. Trump needs more conservative support to lock up the Republican nomination and to have a chance of winning the general election against Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.Attracting conservatives won't be easy. Many are fiercely opposed to Mr. Trump, some to the point of declaring that they wouldn't vote for him under any circumstances. And with the GOP convention only three months away, it is awfully late to begin pursuing the GOP's most important bloc of voters after having largely ignored them.There are other problems. As the longtime conservative political analyst Michael Barone has observed, ""Trump speaks conservatism as a second language he hasn't bothered to master."" The candidate may have felt he would score points with the pro-life movement with his recent advocacy of punishment for women who have abortions. He was wrong and had to reverse his position publicly.Nor is Mr. Trump up to speed on conservative politics. Before the recent Wisconsin primary, he relentlessly attacked Scott Walker, the state's Republican governor, who had endorsed Ted Cruz. Mr. Walker was an early dropout from the presidential race, and thus a ""loser"" in Mr. Trump's mind. But Mr. Walker is enormously popular in his home state, and assailing him backfired on Mr. Trump, who lost the primary.Mr. Trump's political instincts haven't helped him with conservatives. He decides day-to-day what to say and frequently speaks off the cuff. He is often rash and undisciplined. His conservative detractors, especially those in policy and media circles, are appalled.To bring stability to his campaign, Mr. Trump now plans a series of formal speeches on policy issues, set pieces drafted by speechwriters and delivered from prepared texts. This assumes Mr. Trump follows through with the speeches. Avoiding distractions may result from the recent hiring of a professional campaign manager, Paul Manafort.The model is his speech last month in Washington, D.C., to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). He used the address to correct the impression he had left in a televised debate that he would not be a strong defender of Israel. Speaking to Aipac in a sports arena, he read the text on a Teleprompter with few ad libs. He got several standing ovations.In a similar way, Mr. Trump wants to use the policy speeches to persuade conservatives, among other skeptics, that he is more in sync with their thinking than they imagine. If he fails, Republican defectors or a third-party conservative candidate would doom his already slim chance of winning the presidency.The first speech is likely to focus on naming a Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, who died Feb. 13. At a meeting with a group of conservative leaders last month, Mr. Trump asked for a list of potential conservative nominees. The Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society are putting one together.Another speech would discuss education. It would give him an opportunity to explain his opposition to Common Core standards for math and English and why he favors local and state control of schools. Common Core is a hot issue with conservatives.If he follows Mr. Gingrich's advice, Mr. Trump will also speak about infrastructure -- that is, large, expensive public projects. As luck would have it, this is a subject he emphasized in his best-selling 1987 book, ""The Art of the Deal,"" with the conservative-friendly theme of government incompetence and the efficiency of private enterprise.The most precarious speech for Mr. Trump would be on foreign policy and national security. The issue isn't one he can duck, since his views -- sounding more like President Obama than Ronald Reagan -- have alarmed many conservatives. Like Mr. Obama, he is leery of projecting American power around the world. But unlike the president, Mr. Trump thinks the country can't afford the cost. The president prefers soft power.In response to Mr. Trump, last month 117 ""members of the Republican national security community"" issued a scathing letter opposing his nomination. The group, which included former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Robert Zoellick, a former deputy secretary of state and World Bank president, warned that if elected Mr. Trump ""would use the authority of his office to act in ways that make America less safe, and which would diminish our standing in the world.""No matter what he says, he won't win over this group. They are too far apart on too many issues. And Mr. Trump made things worse when he said that his chief adviser on foreign and defense issues is himself. But he may at least be able to alleviate some concerns.In interviews, Mr. Trump has dismissed NATO as ineffective and outdated, and he insisted that America's allies don't pay their share for defense. He has been advised to walk back his comment about NATO. He would also be wise to spell out how he would strengthen our military and how much more our NATO partners and Asian allies should pay for theirs.The overtures to conservatives are crucial to the Trump campaign. His ""pivot"" will have to be genuine, his speeches credible. It's all up to the unpredictable Mr. Trump.---Mr. Barnes, executive editor of the Weekly Standard, is a Fox News commentator.Credit: By Fred Barnes",6/22/16
"House Republicans Have a Better Idea; Meanwhile, Trump fires his campaign manager--a wise move but very late.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798889175?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has already squandered six weeks by insulting a ""Mexican"" judge born in Indiana, offering conspiracy theories, and needlessly attacking defeated rivals. His fundraising is dismal and his staffing inadequate. All this comes at the expense of focused attention on his Democratic opponent. Now the presumptive Republican nominee has fired his campaign manager--a wise decision, but very late.Meanwhile, the Republican House is methodically laying out a comprehensive agenda to spread prosperity, protect the nation, uphold the Constitution, reform health care, and--with its presentation Friday of a comprehensive tax-reform plan--create jobs, grow paychecks and boost the economy.This agenda, dubbed ""A Better Way: Our Vision for a Confident America,"" is Speaker Paul Ryan's brainchild, but the work of the entire Republican conference.Mr. Ryan rolled out its first plank June 7 with an audacious reimagining of policies to help Americans rise out of poverty. The initiative would require those on welfare to seek work while providing them better access to job training and assistance. It would reform poverty-fighting programs to help people move from dependency on government to lives of independence and personal responsibility.Related Articles* A Trump-Ryan Condominium* Saving Speaker Ryan* Trump and the 'Mexican' JudgeRepublicans followed the next day with a robust economic package, based on the premise that increasing prosperity requires expanding free enterprise and rewarding hard work. The plan aims to relieve the enormous regulatory burden on businesses; expand affordable, reliable energy; curb lawsuit abuse and crony capitalism; limit Washington's micromanagement of community banks and the financial decisions of ordinary Americans; and block government bailouts.On June 9, Republicans issued a new national-security plan to protect the homeland, defeat radical Islamic extremism, and restore confidence among our allies and respect among our adversaries.A plan followed to rein in executive overreach and strengthen accountability and transparency in Washington. Republicans would restore constitutional checks on spending and the budget--including by halting illegal executive-branch spending and overturning expensive new regulations pushed through by lame-duck presidents.Last week, the House GOP also released a detailed proposal to replace ObamaCare with a package of reforms centered on the patient and doctor. These include making health insurance portable so workers can take it from job to job, increasing the use of health savings accounts, permitting insurance sales across state lines, allowing small businesses and individuals to band together to get lower prices, expanding wellness programs and reforming medical liability.On Friday, Republicans will add to their agenda a bold and provocative tax-reform package aimed at a simpler, flatter, fairer tax code that encourages jobs and growth while restoring the competitiveness of American companies.The way that the tax reform package was drafted illustrates how the whole agenda came together. Building on the work of his two predecessors, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas held six meetings with the GOP conference over a number of months to hash out ideas. A task force solicited proposals from dozens of congressmen; reached out to job creators, free-market think tanks and center-right economists; and canvassed Republican lawmakers to ensure consensus.If ""A Better Way"" has a shortcoming, it's that it is large and sprawling, consisting of dozens of proposals. But each plank of the agenda draws on principles congressional Republicans can use to tell Americans what they will do next year, regardless of who is president.If Donald Trump occupies the Oval Office, Washington's center of gravity will shift toward Congress, as industrious House and Senate Republicans drive the legislative agenda. If Hillary Clinton is president, ""A Better Way"" will give Republicans the intellectual ammunition to offer a competing vision that--if they retain majorities in Congress--may drive her toward cooperation.Apart from its merits as policy, ""A Better Way"" demonstrates that there is much more to the modern Republican Party than Donald Trump. He casts a large, ominous shadow, but light can break through the pall. House Republicans are working hard to distinguish themselves and their party's principles by presenting an agenda for the 21st century.Their efforts are vital to the GOP's success in November and may determine Mr. Trump's political fortunes. The shame is that he's making their work harder.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",6/23/16

The Agony of a Trump Delegate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785139715?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, fresh off his Northeast sweep, declared himself the ""presumptive nominee."" He presumes too much.For all the news of Mr. Trump's victories and Ted Cruz's veepmate, the essential action of this GOP contest continues to take place far from the media lights. It's happening in towns like Harrisonburg, Va., where Republican voters will gather this weekend to pick a slate of delegates for the Cleveland convention. That's the action that matters, and it's not going Mr. Trump's way.With the media all but anointing the mogul, it's worth a short primer on presidential nominations, why Mr. Trump is still far from claiming the title, and why (by the way) this is, in fact, democracy in action.Start with this: The GOP is a collection of 50 state parties. Each gets a voice in choosing who the national party nominates for president. In long-standing deference to states' rights (a concept conservatives are supposed to revere), the state parties have total control over how they pick delegates to the national convention.Some states, like Colorado, still do this purely the old-fashioned way. Republicans meet at the precinct level, at the district level, and at the state level, and vote for delegates who will speak for them. This isn't a ""rigged"" system, but representative democracy.Other states think it useful to canvas wider views. They hold what the media call primaries, but what are technically ""presidential preference polls."" (Note those words.) In many states, the results of these polls are supposed to bind ""delegates"" to candidates at the national convention.Only here's the rub: Even states with primaries still go through an independent process to elect the actual people who will serve as delegates. The Republicans at these events can still choose whomever they want. And they aren't electing delegates who personally support Mr. Trump.Look at Virginia. The Old Dominion held its statewide preference poll (primary) on March 1, and 35% of voters (who included independents and Democrats) preferred Mr. Trump. Some 17% preferred Mr. Cruz. On paper, the delegates are automatically apportioned based on these results.Yet at the two district conventions so far (in Virginia's 9th and 10th congressional districts), attendees have elected five delegates who personally support Mr. Cruz and only one who supports Mr. Trump. At the statewide convention in Harrisonburg this weekend, 4,000 attendees will choose another 13 delegates. Cruz supporters will likely dominate.This is happening across the country, and no surprise. While some attendees at these events are ""the establishment"" -- party officials and operatives -- many more are intensely committed GOP activists. These are the people who brought you the tea party, the rebels in the U.S. House, and the cheers for government shutdown.They are into principle and ideology -- and that is Mr. Trump's problem. Sources suggest to me that of the 950 ""Trump"" delegates, as many as half despise the former reality-TV star. Meaning that of the 2,472 delegates slated for Cleveland, maybe one-quarter currently want him as the nominee.But aren't his delegates ""pledged"" to vote for him on the first ballot, regardless? A vocal -- and growing -- faction of delegates is saying they are not. A ringleader is Curly Haugland, an unbound delegate from North Dakota, and a longtime member of the GOP's rules committee. In an open letter in March, he argued that there was only one convention in history (1976) in which GOP delegates were ""bound,"" and that this requirement was rescinded in 1980. He says delegates can vote their conscience.Is he right? What matters is that some delegates think so. Many are unhappy that their state legislatures have imposed ""open primaries"" that allow independents and Democrats to vote. Many view it as a bedrock constitutional principle that a party retains its right to choose its own nominee. Many are deeply troubled by Mr. Trump. Some are just ornery.With razor-tight margins, it wouldn't take much to upturn the convention -- even if Mr. Trump does get 1,237 ""pledged"" delegates. All it would take is a small (potentially very small) bloc of Trump delegates to defect -- or simply abstain -- that first round. The outrage from Trump supporters would be huge. Then again, many delegates have concluded that outrage from one side or another is inevitable. So pick your poison.This is why Mr. Trump's team is now trying to craft a new Trump, one harder for the delegates to overthrow. It's why Mr. Trump bangs on about rigged elections -- to exert public pressure on delegates to stay in line. And it's the main reason why the coming races matter: Mr. Trump wants to create a sense of inevitability that will further compel ""his"" delegates to stick. His early success this week in wooing unbound Pennsylvania delegates suggests the pressure may be helping.Still, if conservative activists are anything these days, they are energized and unpredictable. They are the force to reckon with in this nomination contest. And they, more than the TV stations, are the ones to watch.---Write to kim@wsj.comLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint ServiceCredit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",6/23/16
Election 2016: Front-Runner Hits Outsourcing in Indiana --- Trump repeats pledge to slap tariffs on Carrier if it moves jobs to Mexico as planned,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785139531?accountid=12768,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Long before Indiana turned pivotal in the Republican race, Donald Trump began a monthslong campaign lambasting a local manufacturer for its plans to move 2,100 jobs to Mexico.His attacks against Carrier Corp. and others outsourcing jobs overseas helped fuel his improbable rise to front-runner -- and are resonating louder now that the GOP contest is coming to a head here in Tuesday's primary.Speaking not far from a Carrier factory, Mr. Trump on Wednesday repeated his pledge to impose a 35% tariff on products the company makes in Mexico. ""They're going to call me and say, 'Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,' "" he told a raucous crowd.Mr. Trump's promise may help garner him votes statewide, but it rings hollow with the union representing many Carrier employees, which is backing Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders, citing his long record of voting against trade deals. Mr. Sanders, not Mr. Trump, was invited to speak at a union rally slated for Friday.""If I thought for one minute that Trump could do what he says, I might vote for him,"" said Chuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999. ""There's trade laws, and I don't give a damn who the president is, he can't stop it.""Mr. Trump's advocacy for the displaced Carrier employees shows both the promise and pitfalls of his populist bid for the GOP nomination. His anti-corporate rhetoric galvanizes the large swath of Republican voters who feel left out of the economic recovery. But his protectionist bent infuriates many traditional conservatives and has cast a spotlight on some of his own businesses' reliance on overseas labor.Mr. Trump's campaign declined to comment on the union's endorsement of Mr. Sanders. The businessman has acknowledged his clothing lines are made in China and Mexico, casting those decisions as proof of his business savvy as those countries ""devalue their currencies"" and offer cheaper labor markets.""Nobody knows the system better than me,"" he said in a March debate. ""I'm a businessman . . . We're allowed to do it.""Indiana looks to be a last stand for Mr. Trump's leading rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, who is trying to siphon away enough votes from the front-runner to force a contested convention in July. Mr. Trump is leading in statewide polls by six points, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average.Although he is opposed by leaders of the steelworkers union, Mr. Trump's focus on Carrier has won over some rank-and-file workers such as Michael McMillan, 57 years old, who took the day off to attend the Trump rally, and wore a white polo shirt with the company logo on his chest.""Once they put it in motion, to send it to Monterrey, I thought that was it,"" he said of Carrier's plans to move the factory. But now, he said, Mr. Trump is fighting for him and other workers. ""He may not be able to keep Carrier here, but he can keep other jobs here.""Carrier, owned by United Technologies Corp., announced in February that it would begin cutting 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis next year. Another United Technologies subsidiary that makes air-conditioning parts is eliminating 700 jobs in Huntington in the northeast part of the state.Three days after a video went online of Carrier employees heckling a company official announcing the move to Mexico, Mr. Trump raised the workers' plight at a Feb. 13 debate in Greenville, S.C. Mr. Trump hasn't stopped talking about Carrier since. His calls for retaliation have drawn cheers at rallies from the blue-collar workers who make up his most loyal supporters.""It's a threat to punish a company, but it's an idle threat, because he doesn't have authority to do it,"" said Jeffrey Schott, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.""This is nothing new, this political campaign and this kind of populist rhetoric,"" United Technologies Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said Wednesday in response to a question from a Wall Street Journal reporter. ""For us, what's important is that we're doing the right thing for all the stakeholders, not just investors, but employees and their families as well.""Mr. Hayes said some employees were given as much as three years' notice before losing their jobs and would be eligible for college-tuition assistance and severance pay.Mr. Cruz and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton have also decried the factory's planned move to Mexico in a campaign in which Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump have led both parties on a more populist path.Beyond Carrier, Mr. Trump has threatened actions against an array of companies for shifting to foreign labor, including Whirlpool Corp.; Sentry Safe, which is shutting down plants in New York and Indiana, under the ownership of Master Lock; and Ford Motor Co., which is moving some production to Mexico.At the Trump rally on Wednesday, Mr. McMillan, the Carrier employee, said he was stunned that such a profitable arm of the company would leave its workers stranded.""We've built this mountain up, we've made it a mountain,"" he said of the Carrier brand. ""Now they're moving the whole mountain,"" he said, shaking his head.---Ted Mann contributed to this article.Credit: By Ben Kesling and Beth Reinhard",6/23/16
Election 2016: Republican Lawmakers Warm to Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785139226?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- The prospect of Donald Trump at the top of their ticket in November has led some congressional Republicans to openly forecast the end of their party. Others have been quietly critical, with leaders pushing back when Mr. Trump stirred up anti-immigrant sentiment or proclaimed that the nomination process is rigged.But a new attitude among some Republicans on Capitol Hill is emerging. Icy glares are starting to thaw. More Republicans are slowly beginning to express support for the candidate. And Mr. Trump's early congressional backers, who initially faced scorn for backing the businessman, are finding themselves in a more comfortable position.""You're not having to stick your neck out quite as far as a few months ago,"" said Rep. Duncan Hunter (R., Calif.), one of the first members to endorse Mr. Trump back in March. ""It's less of a stretch now. People like to be with the winner.""The thaw corresponds with the victories Mr. Trump has racked up, winning five states on Tuesday alone. On Thursday, at least three more Republicans backed Mr. Trump, including his first endorsement from a female lawmaker and two from House committee chairmen.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), a policy heavyweight who had previously remained largely silent on the GOP presidential primary, praised on Wednesday Mr. Trump's foreign policy speech.""Today, Donald Trump delivered a very good foreign policy speech in which he laid out his vision for American engagement in the world,"" Mr. Corker wrote in his first statement naming a specific presidential candidate.""I like the fact that he is challenging the foreign-policy establishment,"" Mr. Corker told reporters Thursday after speaking with Mr. Trump on the phone. ""I'm glad that that is being challenged because it has not been particularly on target.""Even Republicans who have been reluctant to back him are initiating conversations with his small group of surrogates on Capitol Hill, showing up at organizational meetings and trying to figure out how to align with the front-runner.""Two weeks ago, people were telling me about Donald Trump's issues or negatives,"" said Rep. Chris Collins (R., N.Y.) after a meeting between Republican lawmakers and Trump campaign officials. ""Now they're reaching out, I want to support him, I'm going to support him, help me understand . . . there's definitely a mood shift, an energy shift.""The weekly meetings that began several weeks ago have doubled in size, Mr. Collins said, with 16 Republicans showing up on Thursday.Not all of Capitol Hill has been won over. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and onetime candidate for the GOP nomination, unleashed a string of tweets criticizing Mr. Trump's speech as ""pathetic"" and ""disconnected.""""Are we sure the guy running the teleprompter has the pages in the right order?"" the senator tweeted, with the hashtag ""#notmakinganysense""But in the House, Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R., Pa.) and House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R., Fla.) offered Mr. Trump unqualified endorsements.

She also said that it was time for Mr. Trump's critics on Capitol Hill to line up behind him. ""What we need to do is unify the party.""Even Republicans who have endorsed Texas Sen.

""Because that's exactly what I've always done for decades [and] what I will do in this campaign.""She also cited her two successful elections to the U.S. Senate and the many votes she has received in the 2008 and 2016 presidential elections. ""So it doesn't really square with reality,"" she said. His attacks are ""kind of silly,"" she said, saying she is more bothered by his attacks on other groups.Mr. Trump set off the latest back-and-forth on Tuesday after both he and Mrs. Clinton had strong showings in the East Coast primaries. ""Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5% of the vote. The only thing she's got going is the woman's card,"" he said. That prompted days of mocking by the Clinton campaign and its supporters.Mr. Trump stuck with the attack, saying that Mrs. Clinton couldn't run for ""city council"" without the ""woman's card.""Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders share some views -- such as opposition to free-trade agreements -- and have both challenged their respective political establishments. Mr. Trump has suggested that he could win over some of the Sanders backers if Mr. Sanders loses the Democratic nomination.Mrs. Clinton dismissed that idea. She cited climate change, the minimum wage and equitable pay for women as issues where Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are at odds and called the Republican front-runner's foreign policy views ""reckless, loose, dangerous.""""I don't think that's very appealing"" to Sanders backers, she said. ""I'm going to be very aggressive in . . . reaching out to Sen. Sanders's supporters, but we have so much more in common. And we have far more in common than they do with Donald Trump or any Republican.""Asked about insults that Mr. Trump had delivered to her, Mrs. Clinton said in the CNN interview, ""I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak."" An aide said she was referring to past GOP opponents. ""I'm not going to deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me,"" she said.After his losses on Tuesday in four out of five states, Mr. Sanders, who trails in the race for convention delegates, suggested he was staying in the contest in hopes of influencing the Democratic Party's platform on key issues. Mrs. Clinton suggested to CNN that there may be room for discussion.""We're gonna talk. We're gonna work together. Because, look, we want the same goals,"" she said. ""We really are going to be unified and have a tremendous progressive agenda to run on in the fall. And I really think that will help us win the election and it will also help us govern.""Credit: By Laura Meckler",6/27/16
Declarations: Simple Patriotism Trumps Ideology,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785452794?accountid=12768,"The wind is at Donald Trump's back, and it's the kind that doesn't lessen but build. Last week he won the New York primary with an astounding 60% of the vote to John Kasich's 25% and Ted Cruz's 15%. This week he swept the five-state Northeast regional primaries with numbers that neared or surpassed the New York results -- 54% in Maryland, 57% in Pennsylvania, 58% in Connecticut, 61% in Delaware and 64% in Rhode Island. He beat Mr. Kasich in Greenwich, Conn., the affluent enclave of the old moderate Republicanism. Amazingly, he carried every county in all five states, and every county in New York except Manhattan. With 10 million votes, Mr. Trump is on track to become the biggest primary vote-getter in GOP history. He did well with varied demographic groups, old and young, college graduates, rich and not.This is the kind of political momentum that tends to grow. A political saying attributed to Haley Barbour is that in politics this is the dynamic: Good gets better and bad gets worse. Very smart analysts and reporters have been translating all these victories into delegate counts, which of course is the key question. But as I look at where we are I think: Get your mind off 1,237; get your mind on the wind at Donald Trump's back. After all the missteps and embarrassments of the past few months, his support is building.""I consider myself the presumptive nominee,"" Mr. Trump said in his victory remarks. He is.Nothing wrong with Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich continuing to forge on. If you added their votes together the other night, Mr. Trump still would have beaten them. But they're imagining they still have a shot, and Mr. Cruz just brought in Carly Fiorina as a reinforcement. His admiration of Ronald Reagan is such that he even imitates his blunders. That is what it was for Reagan in 1976 when he picked a running mate before the convention. Desperate gambits are more likely to work when they don't look desperate.Here I note an odd aspect of this cycle. Candidates at this point, roughly nine months in, are supposed to be dog-tired, near the end of their personal resources, exhausted and, if they're not winning, depressed. That's how it usually goes. But Mr. Kasich is clearly having the time of his life and told me as much in November. Mr. Cruz told me the same thing last week, at a Journal editorial board meeting. I expected to see him tired and dragging. No, fresh as a daisy. Mr. Trump too is clearly having a ball.I find their joy distressing. America is faced with overwhelming problems, the voters are deeply concerned about our future, and they're happy little chappies in the cable news town hall. I think they've absorbed too well the idea of the power of the happy warrior. I would respect them more if now and then they'd outline our problems and look blue.In my continuing quest to define aspects of Mr. Trump's rise, to my own satisfaction, I offer what was said this week in a talk with a small group of political activists, all of whom back him. One was about to begin approaching various powerful and influential Republicans who did not support him, and make the case. I told her I'd been thinking that maybe Mr. Trump's appeal is simple: What Trump supporters believe, what they perceive as they watch him, is that he is on America's side.And that comes as a great relief to them, because they believe that for 16 years Presidents Bush and Obama were largely about ideologies. They seemed not so much on America's side as on the side of abstract notions about justice and the needs of the world. Mr. Obama's ideological notions are leftist, and indeed he is a hero of the international left. He is about international climate-change agreements, and leftist views of gender, race and income equality. Mr. Bush's White House was driven by a different ideology -- neoconservatism, democratizing, nation building, defeating evil in the world, privatizing Social Security.But it was all ideology.Then Mr. Trump comes and in his statements radiate the idea that he's not at all interested in ideology, only in making America great again -- through border security and tough trade policy, etc. He's saying he's on America's side, period.And because people are so happy to hear this after 16 years, because it seems right to them, they give him a pass on his lack of experience in elective office and the daily realities of national politics. They accept him even though he is a casino developer and brander who became famous on reality TV.They forgive it all. Not only because they're tired of bad policy but because they're tired of ideology.You could see this aspect of Trumpism -- I'm about America, end of story -- in his much-discussed foreign-policy speech this week. I have found pretty much everything said about it to be true. It was long, occasionally awkward-sounding and sometimes contradictory. It was interesting nonetheless. He was trying to blend into a coherent whole what he's previously said when popping off on the hustings. He was trying to establish that there's a theme to the pudding. He was also trying to reassure potential supporters that he is actually serious, that he does have a foreign-policy framework as opposed to just a grab bag of emotional impulses.The speech was an attack on the reigning Washington foreign-policy elite of both parties, which he scored as incompetent and unsuccessful: ""Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, and this led to one foreign-policy disaster after another."" Mistakes in Iraq, Egypt, Libya and Syria threw the region ""into crisis,"" and helped create ISIS. He described democracy-promotion efforts as destructive, costing ""thousands of American lives and many trillions of dollars."" Our resources are overextended, our allies must contribute more, our friends don't trust us, nor do our allies respect us. He called for ""a coherent foreign policy based on American interests."" His interest is ""focusing on creating stability."" ""We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,"" including a ""pause for reassessment,"" which will help prevent the next San Bernardino.He positioned himself to Hillary Clinton's left on foreign policy -- she is hawkish, too eager for assertions of U.S. military power, and has bad judgment. This will be the first time in modern history a Republican presidential candidate is to the left of the Democrat, and that will make things interesting. It reminded me of how Mr. Trump, in his insistence that he will not cut or add new limits to entitlement spending, could get to Mrs. Clinton's left on that key domestic question, too.He certainly jumbles up the categories. Bobby Knight, introducing him at a rally in Evansville, Ind., on Thursday, said that Mr. Trump is not a Republican or a Democrat. The crowd seemed to like that a lot.Those conservative writers and thinkers who have for nine months warned the base that Mr. Trump is not a conservative should consider the idea that a large portion of the Republican base no longer sees itself as conservative, at least as that term has been defined the past 15 years by Washington writers and thinkers.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",6/27/16
"Election 2016: Trump Touts Record, Urges Party Unity --- Protesters gather as Republican presidential front-runner addresses California convention",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785452596?accountid=12768,"BURLINGAME, Calif. -- Republican front-runner Donald Trump, campaigning in California following fresh primary victories this past week, called for party unity as he addressed a gathering at the state's GOP convention while protesters denounced him and clashed with police outside.Saying he was best positioned to beat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in a general-election matchup, Mr. Trump said he would put into play New York, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania in November, states that have backed the Democratic nominee in most recent presidential elections.""The Republican Party, in a presidential sense, doesn't win anymore,"" Mr. Trump said. ""You pick your standard cookie-cutters . . . I am different because I am going to win states that nobody else can.""Protesters gathered outside the hotel near San Francisco where Mr. Trump was addressing the convention. Some rushed past barriers and police to get to the hotel but were blocked by police from the doors.Mr. Trump avoided the scene by entering the hotel through a back entrance.""That was not the easiest entrance I have ever made,"" Mr. Trump said, once inside and on stage. ""My wife called, she said there are helicopters following you, and then we went under a fence and through a fence and, oh boy, it felt like I was crossing the border, actually.""Speaking for just under 30 minutes, Mr. Trump lauded himself and his victories in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware on Tuesday while also deriding attempts by some in the party to deny him the nomination through a convention battle as evidence of a ""rigged system.""He also mocked attempts by rivals Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich to form an alliance against him as ""total weakness"" that had come apart.""These are politicians, folks, they can't make a deal,"" Mr. Trump said. ""How are they going to deal with China?""""We have to get together as a party because it is a tougher road to the presidency for the Republicans,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And you really have to pick somebody that knows what is happening, that is really, really good. I accept the position.""The New York businessman was the first of the Republican presidential candidates slated to address California's GOP convention. All of the GOP candidates plan to campaign in the delegate-rich state that could play a decisive role in choosing the party's nominee for the first time in a generation.Mr. Kasich was scheduled to address the audience Friday night. Mr. Cruz will speakon Saturday, as will Carly Fiorina, whom the Texas senator this past week picked as his vice-presidential running mate.Mr. Trump has a big lead over Mr. Cruz, but Mr. Trump can't reach the 1,237-delegate threshold to clinch the nomination on a first-ballot convention vote without winning at least some California delegates.California's June 7 primary has 172 delegates up for grabs, making it the biggest prize in this year's extended nominating contest.The last time the state figured so prominently in a Republican presidential primary was in 1964 when California helped Barry Goldwater beat Nelson Rockefeller. Mr. Goldwater then lost the general election to incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson.Officials in the Cruz and Kasich campaigns have recently begun discussions about which of California's 53 districts each of them will campaign in as part of an effort to deny Mr. Trump delegates, according to people involved in the talks. The delegates are allocated on a winner-take-all by congressional-district system.The system essentially creates 53 minielections, with 13 delegates awarded to the candidate who wins the popular vote statewide.In California so far, Mr. Trump appears to be sticking to a strategy of dominating media attention and drawing large crowds. He hosted a rally in conservative Orange County on Thursday evening. His reception there drew large crowds of supporters and protesters.About 20 people were arrested, and some reported minor injuries.Credit: By Alejandro Lazo",6/27/16
Donald Trump's Path,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782389066?accountid=12768,"'We don't have much of a race anymore,"" declared Donald Trump in his Tuesday night victory speech, with his familiar understatement. He knows that's not true, and that he could still lose the nomination at the GOP convention, but John Kasich or Ted Cruz are going to have to do more than steal delegates to stop him now. They have to coordinate and win some states.Some of the ""Never Trump"" crowd are claiming that New York changed nothing in the race, but that is wishful thinking. Mr. Trump won at least 89 of the 95 available delegates and all but one of 27 congressional districts. (He lost the East Side of Manhattan.) He barely passed the 50% threshold in more than a dozen counties, but that only underscores the mistake his opponents made in conceding the businessman's home state. They could have denied him more delegates with even a modicum of advertising in Albany, Buffalo or elsewhere.The blowout victory erases the memory of Mr. Trump's defeat in Wisconsin two weeks ago and propels him into next week's contests in five mid-Atlantic and New England states. Mr. Trump is leading in the polls in all of those states, and without more concerted opposition he'll sweep those too.New York was especially cruel to Mr. Cruz, whose third place finish with 14.5% underscored his lack of appeal to less conservative voters. He failed to carry a single county, as New Yorkers repaid him for his gibe in Iowa against ""New York values."" Can Republicans finally retire the Sarah Palin trope that Americans in certain zip codes aren't real Americans?Mr. Cruz would do best now to leave next week's eastern contests to Mr. Kasich and focus on Indiana May 3, Nebraska May 10, and California June 7. With its winner-take-all rules, Indiana is now make-or-break for the Texan -- and maybe for Mr. Trump too. Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a stalwart conservative running for re-election this year, will have an excruciating decision to make on whether to endorse a candidate or stay neutral. He'll make some Republicans unhappy either way.As for Mr. Kasich, he has so far failed to catch popular fire despite the manifest weaknesses of his remaining opponents. Connecticut, Maryland and Pennsylvania may be his last best chances, especially if Mr. Cruz stays away. The Ohio Governor keeps stressing his political experience and electability, which are less potent in this year of the outsider candidate. We think he is most appealing when he talks more about how he'd change Washington and less about his personal virtues.After next week Mr. Kasich will also face a choice of how far to take his campaign. If he wins none of the five northeastern states and stays in the race through Indiana, he risks becoming a spoiler who lets Mr. Trump win the Hoosier State, which would mean the New Yorker could get very close to the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination. Mr. Kasich is betting on an open convention to nominate him, but that requires blocking Mr. Trump on the first ballot.We continue to believe the delegates in Cleveland should nominate the most electable candidate. But realistically, Mr. Trump will be hard to deny if he rolls through the remaining primaries -- even if he is short of 1,237. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich are outhustling the New Yorker in the fight for unbound delegates, but they also need to go into Cleveland with a credible claim on GOP voter support.As for Mr. Trump, his main opponent continues to be -- himself. His insults and bullying have built a loyal base of support but also a firm opposition. Even with his New York triumph, he has won only 38% of the GOP vote. His negative favorability rating -- 65% in the latest WSJ/NBC poll -- is unprecedented for a potential presidential nominee.The Trump camp believes this public dislike is a reaction to the candidate's rude behavior and thus fixable, and they say he can change his tone as he approaches the convention and fall campaign. They point out that he even called his opponent ""Senator Cruz"" rather than ""Lyin' Ted."" Miracles happen, and he did control his political id on Tuesday night. But Mr. Trump's inner hooligan has never stayed locked up for long.As a major party nominee, the New Yorker would be the biggest gamble since George McGovern in 1972. He'll have no chance in November if he can't first convince a larger majority of Republicans that it's not a suicide leap.",6/27/16
Election 2016: Goat Herd Helps Trump Lower Tax Bite --- New Jersey farmland law lets him save on property taxes at his upscale golf courses,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782389058?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has found a solution that cuts both his grass and his tax bill: Goats.The Republican presidential front-runner's small goat herd, combined with hay farming and wood cutting, let him qualify for a New Jersey farmland tax break that saves him tens of thousands of dollars a year in property taxes on two golf courses, according to public records.Mr. Trump's golf clubs in Bedminster and Colts Neck both receive the break and pay reduced property taxes on the part of the land devoted to agriculture. The Bedminster course includes 113 acres of hay production and eight goats, while the Colts Neck course has 40 acres of hay plus stands of trees, according to tax-break applications filed with local governments.It isn't clear precisely how much Mr. Trump saves in taxes when his assessments are based on agricultural production rather than the land's market value. One method of calculating the savings -- taxing the farm portion of the golf course properties at the same per-acre level as the nonfarm portion -- suggests he pays less than $1,000 in taxes a year on land that would otherwise carry annual taxes of about $80,000, according to property values listed on the state's website.Mr. Trump continues a long tradition of famous and wealthy property owners who have benefited from the farmland assessment program, which was written into New Jersey's constitution in 1963 to prevent overdevelopment in the state with the highest population density in the U.S. Others have included former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, magazine publisher Steve Forbes and rock star Bruce Springsteen, according to published reports.""This is a good example of Donald Trump farming the government,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the state's Sierra Club chapter, who accuses the developer of ""not paying his fair share"" by using the incentive for a golf course instead of a legitimate farm.The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request for comment about the tax break.Mr. Trump has led in public polling in advance of New Jersey's June 7 primary election, as he tries to clinch a majority of delegates before July's Republican National Convention. New Jersey's Gov. Chris Christie, a former presidential candidate, has endorsed him.Mr. Trump's golf courses last applied for the farmland assessments in 2015, and both courses' requests were approved by local tax assessors. Each course is about 50 miles from Trump Tower in Manhattan and each is in a wealthy suburb known for its horse farms. William Laird, the Colts Neck assessor, said he had no doubt that the course complies with the law.The records show both Trump courses work with local farmers. James Carter, the Bedminster farmer, declined to comment, and the Colts Neck farmer, Thomas Orgo, didn't reply to requests for comment.The farmland tax break has been both popular and controversial in New Jersey as the Garden State tries to retain its agricultural heritage and placate voters who are upset by having the country's highest property taxes. As of 2013, more than 1 million acres in the state -- 18% of New Jersey's land area -- was under farmland assessment, according to the state Department of Agriculture.""The importance of the program to agriculture is paramount,"" said Peter Furey, executive director of the New Jersey Farm Bureau. ""You own land. You conduct farming practices that meet the threshold. And you're in.""Mr. Furey said policy changes in 2013 strengthened the program. Those included doubling the annual agricultural sales threshold from $500 to $1,000. ""This whole awareness has been visited on the program for the better,"" he said.But Mr. Tittel of the Sierra Club said the changes didn't go far enough and still allow corporate office parks and wealthy people's estates to qualify for a benefit. ""It's survived politically, because it's been the landed gentry and the corporations that have taken advantage of it,"" he said.The property tax breaks are separate from Mr. Trump's use of a so-called conservation easement on the Bedminster course that allowed him to claim a federal income-tax deduction. In that instance, Mr. Trump donated the golf course's future development rights to the town, and public records show his contribution reduced the property's value by $39.1 million by pledging not to build houses there. He could have deducted that much from his federal income taxes.That was a one-time break. The property tax benefits can continue indefinitely as long as Mr. Trump and his goats and hay qualify under the state's rules.Credit: By Richard Rubin",6/27/16
Trump's Emptiest Threat,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782389025?accountid=12768,"New York was generous Tuesday to its native son Donald Trump. He grabbed 89 of the 95 delegates up for grabs and for the first time in any state received more than 50% of the vote.Mr. Trump's sweeping victory was impressive. But, as Henry Olsen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center pointed out at National Review, it was also expected. New York Republicans tend to be self-described moderates, and either unchurched or Catholic -- all groups that Mr. Trump has dominated in other states. Those demographic factors, combined with a home-field advantage, meant no one was going to deny The Donald.While Team Trump rejoices, their candidate's total delegate haul is pegged at 845 by the Associated Press. With 950 delegates in someone else's column, the New York real estate tycoon is 105 behind his competitors and must win 58% of the remaining delegates for a first-ballot victory. He's won 47% of those chosen so far.The importance of a first-ballot victory is crucial: Mr. Trump has been walloped in the state and district party conventions where the actual delegates are selected. He will find himself in Cleveland with many men and women who are bound to him for only one or two ballots -- but then are eager to vote for someone else.One iron convention rule is that once a front-runner begins to slide, it is virtually impossible to reverse the decline. To shame delegates into sticking with him and rally support for the coming contests, Mr. Trump will continue attacking the GOP selection process, as he did Sunday on Staten Island, where he called it ""rigged"" and ""corrupt and crooked.""He has also intimated that violence will result if he is denied the nomination, suggesting last month there would be riots. His allies have threatened to post the hotel-room numbers where defectors -- ""double-agent"" delegates, Mr. Trump calls them -- are staying. Naturally, if violence resulted they say it would be beyond their control.The New York businessman is also leaving the door open to an independent bid for the White House if he is denied the nomination at the national convention. ""I have been treated very unfairly,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper late last month.Republicans should be concerned about the suggestions of violence, but they can stop worrying about Mr. Trump's threats to run as an independent. The reason is simple: According to the National Association of Secretaries of State, by the time Republicans gather in Cleveland on July 18, the deadline for Mr. Trump to be listed on the ballot as an independent will already have passed in 12 states with a combined 166 Electoral College votes.First up is Texas. To be on the ballot as an independent, Mr. Trump must file, by May 9, a declaration of candidacy, slate of electors and signatures from roughly 80,000 registered voters -- 1% of state turnout during the 2012 presidential contest.A flurry of deadlines follows in June: Colorado on the 6th, Vermont the 16th, North Carolina the 24th, Illinois the 27th, Rhode Island the 29th and New Mexico the 30th. Five more states close before the convention is gaveled to order: Georgia on July 12 and Florida, Indiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina on July 15.Rhode Island and Vermont merely require a declaration of candidacy and a thousand signatures, but the others demand more -- from 5,000 signatures in Colorado to nearly 90,000 in North Carolina.One additional state's deadline comes during the GOP national convention. By Thursday, July 21, the day currently planned for the nominee's acceptance speech, an independent candidate would have to submit roughly 30,000 signatures in Michigan, which has 16 electoral votes.In the two weeks after the convention, eight more states with a combined 70 Electoral College votes close, six on August 1: Arkansas, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Then come South Dakota and Wisconsin on August 2. That would require gathering tens of thousands more signatures.It is possible Mr. Trump could collect them. But to what end, if he has already missed the chance to get on the ballot in a dozen states, whose deadlines passed before the GOP convention concluded? It would be clear to the entire nation that Mr. Trump was a spoiler, bent on handing the White House to Hillary Clinton, and not a serious candidate.Of course, he could start filing signatures and declarations now, and say that he is keeping his options open. But that would diminish Mr. Trump's appeal in the remaining GOP primaries, and further undermine whatever good will he has with Republican voters.Much of what Mr. Trump says is unserious bluster. Republicans can now safely put in that category his threat to run as an independent.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Could Donald Trump Be the Teddy Roosevelt of 2016?"" -- WSJ Apr. 27, 2016)Credit: By Karl Rove",6/27/16
Trump: 'I'm Not Going to Blow It',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782388938?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, after notching a big win in New York, is planning to roll out significant changes in his campaign, including giving a policy speech on foreign affairs and using teleprompters and a speechwriter.He and his newly recast team also are pledging to do more outreach to Washington Republican leaders, who have often been hostile and the target of Trump attacks, and to spend significant amounts of money to run a more conventional campaign.Mr. Trump, in an interview, acknowledged the need for a shift. ""The campaign is evolving and transitioning, and so am I,"" he said. ""I'll be more effective and more disciplined."" He's changing, he said, because ""I'm not going to blow it.""Still, Mr. Trump said he wouldn't substantially change his personal style and populist message at his huge rallies.""I'm still the same candidate,"" he said. ""Can you imagine how upset my supporters would be after waiting for hours?""Indeed, at his first post-New York rally Wednesday in Indianapolis, Mr. Trump reverted to form, calling Sen. Ted Cruz ""Lyin' Ted"" and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton ""Crooked Hillary,"" while taunting protesters who were being escorted out.Though his New York win, with some 60% of the vote, cemented Mr. Trump's position as most likely to win the GOP nomination, he continues to face the challenge of warding off rivals led by Mr. Cruz to accumulate the 1,237 delegates needed.The goal now ""is to create so much distance in the total number of votes and delegates between them that the inevitability of the Trump candidacy will be powerful,"" said Paul Manafort, a veteran political consultant recently brought onto the team. That could help persuade uncommitted delegates to overcome misgivings and move Mr. Trump's way. The five primary states next Tuesday appear to be favorable terrain for him.The evolutions in the campaign organization and style began early this month with the arrival of Mr. Manafort. He was recruited to handle delegate procurement and manage what could be a raucous convention. But after he did an audit of the unorthodox operation, his role grew to one of converting it to a more traditional campaign.The new direction is a shift from campaign manager Corey Lewandowski's mantra ""Let Trump be Trump."" Mr. Manafort's position means that Mr. Lewandowski isn't calling all the shots, but instead can focus on ""overseeing day-to-day operations,"" Mr. Lewandowski said.An early step in the revamp will be the foreign-affairs speech, set for April 27 in Washington. One theme, Mr. Trump said, will be the relationship between economics and national security. ""We're protecting nations, and we're not being properly compensated for that protection,"" he said.He has said that before, particularly regarding the U.S. contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the line has rattled U.S. allies in Europe. A test of the speech will be whether he can call for more burden-sharing without further unsettling allies.Mr. Trump will deliver the speech with teleprompters, which he has often derided. This week, a pair were set up in his office, which he was using to practice. Still, he won't use them at his rallies.More policy speeches are in the works, with jobs a likely topic. As the campaign sets up an office in Washington, it plans to hire a speechwriter. Mr. Trump has never used one, preferring to riff at his rallies, from his hand-scrawled notes of just a few words.Mr. Trump's speech Tuesday night, though delivered without a teleprompter, gave a preview of the new style he plans. It lasted less than eight minutes and lacked the negative adjectives about his rivals that peppered previous victory speeches. The focus was on delivering jobs and becoming the nominee.Mr. Manafort's influence is being felt in Mr. Trump's pocketbook. Having spent only about $40 million on the campaign over the last 10 months, mostly of his own money, the billionaire has committed to spending perhaps half that amount in the next two months, according to one person familiar with the campaign.""I'll spend what it takes,"" Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump has scaled back his media appearances in recent days, and that will continue, he said. The new media strategy, said a senior adviser, is ""to be less exposed and to control media impressions in order for the message to be more powerful.""Wisconsin's April 5 primary was the last in which Mr. Trump's campaign was run by his seat-of-the-pants instincts. Since then, Mr. Trump hasn't appeared on theSunday-morning interview shows he dominated for months.His time long was controlled by Mr. Lewandowski. That is changing as new aides come aboard. So far, the campaign still doesn't employ a scheduler or a pollster, though polling firms are pitching their services.In an early meeting, Mr. Manafort, the only one in the campaign team who calls Mr. Trump by his first name, told him he needed to ""win smart and with purpose."" Mr. Trump has agreed to hiring a bigger and more professional staff.There will be a new focus on winning not just statewide vote totals but also the vote in specific congressional districts, where most delegates are awarded. In the New York primary, Mr. Manafort picked the location of each rally for its importance in delegate selection.Mr. Manafort is adding the type of political consultants Mr. Trump has in the past called a waste of money. Rick Wiley, who led Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's brief presidential campaign, joined the Trump team last week as political director. He is involved in trying to capture unbound delegates.Mr. Manafort brought on Tim Clark, a longtime GOP strategist based in Sacramento, as California state director. Mr. Trump can't reach the delegate target without a significant haul from California, where 172 are at stake on June 7.One skeptic of the new approach is Katie Packer, leader of the Our Principles PAC, which wants the GOP to nominate someone else. She said Wednesday Mr. Trump's assurances he can change his tone and style ring hollow. ""The things that he has done and said speak to his character,"" Ms. Packer said.The campaign has healing work to do with Republican Party leaders, an effort Mr. Manafort pushed during meetings with Republican lawmakers this week. Still, Mr. Trump continues to complain the party has a ""rigged"" system of choosing delegates, and just this week, his campaign circulated a memo urging surrogates to attack the Republican National Committee for its rules.Political pros aren't the only ones who have urged Mr. Trump to shift the campaign's approach. Son Donald Jr. said in a Tuesday interview that just as the family business adapts to ""market conditions,"" the campaign needed to adjust to ""political realities"" and prepare for a general election.Credit: By Monica Langley and Reid J.

Trump Posts Big Win in New York,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1782116406?accountid=12768,"Republican Donald Trump swept to a resounding victory Tuesday in the New York presidential primary, propelling him closer to the GOP nomination and making it far harder for his rivals to block his path.It was an expected yet clutch win on home turf for Mr. Trump. He hadn't won a contest since a month ago in Arizona, while rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz scored in five states.""We don't have much of a race anymore,"" Mr. Trump said in a victory speech at his New York City office tower.Mr. Trump cleared the 50% threshold to win all statewide delegates, plus almost all of the delegates awarded in the state's 27 congressional districts, according to unofficial results reported by the New York State Board of Elections. That result would give Mr. Trump about 90 of the state's 95 delegates.Mr. Cruz's drubbing in New York makes it mathematically impossible for him in the remaining primaries to get to the needed 1,237 bound delegates before the July convention. He could still collect enough delegates, however, to keep Mr. Trump from clinching the nomination.Mr. Trump boasted about his lead in popular votes and dismissed Mr. Cruz's success at electing slates of loyal convention delegates in what he called ""a crooked system."" Those pro-Cruz delegates could deprive Mr. Trump of the nomination at a contested convention on the first ballot.""Nobody should take delegates and claim victory unless they get those delegates with voters and voting,"" Mr. Trump said. ""The people aren't going to stand for it.""Mr. Cruz, speaking in Philadelphia before the polls closed, didn't dwell on his loss in New York. He drew an unexpected comparison with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.""This is the year of the outsider,"" Mr. Cruz said in a low-key speech for an election night. ""I'm an outsider. Bernie Sanders is an outsider, both with the same diagnosis but both with very different paths to healing.""It appears that Mr. Cruz will emerge from the New York primary with no additional delegates and second-place finisher John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, will pick up as many as four. John Weaver, a chief Kasich strategist, said Mr. Cruz's poor showing suggests Mr. Cruz isn't the best vehicle for Republican efforts to stop Mr. Trump.""The next seven days are absolutely critical and every Republican in the country who wants an open convention and to win the White House should rally around Gov. Kasich,"" Mr. Weaver said in a campaign memo Tuesday night.Both of Mr. Trump's rivals must now compete in five East Coast states next Tuesday favorable to the front-runner -- Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Mr. Cruz is expected to lag in those states, but is counting on winning enough delegates in May to deprive the front-runner of the majority needed to clinch the nomination outright on the first ballot at the GOP convention.""Trump was expected to win his home state,"" said Cruz spokeswoman Alice Stewart of the New York contest. ""What we are about is picking up delegates.""Mr. Cruz plans to campaign in Pennsylvania, signaling some hope of picking up a share of the state's 71 delegates, which will include 54 not bound to any specific candidate. But Mr. Trump has been running up big leads on the East Coast, generally not conservative enough to be Cruz country.Mr. Cruz's supporters -- and other anti-Trump Republicans -- see their next big chance for a statewide win in Indiana on May 3 and Nebraska May 10. Both are more-conservative states with large evangelical populations. The Nebraska primary is closed, the kind of all-Republican contests that tend to favor Mr. Cruz over Mr. Trump, who has benefited in states that allow crossover voting by Democrats and independents.""Both Indiana and Nebraska represent big opportunities"" to block Mr. Trump, said Katie Packer, chairman of the anti-Trump group, Our Principles PAC. ""The voters there look more like Iowa and Wisconsin than they do New York.""The battle for Indiana's 57 delegates is already stirring. Mr. Trump is holding a rally in Indianapolis Wednesday. Mr. Cruz appears at a state GOP dinner Thursday and his wife Heidi is making five appearances over two days later this week.Nebraska is a winner-take-all primary, which awards all 36 of the delegate slots to the candidate with the highest statewide vote total. Mr. Cruz has won the neighboring states of Iowa, Colorado and Wyoming. The state's popular junior senator, Ben Sasse, has been a vocal leader of the anti-Trump movement and announced that he had cast an early ballot for Mr. Cruz.The biggest target for Mr. Cruz and his rivals is California, which votes June 7, the last day of the primary season. The state will award the nation's largest bounty of delegates. Of the state's 172 delegates, 13 are awarded to the candidate with the most statewide votes. The rest are allocated to the winner in each congressional district.Statewide, most polls show Mr. Trump in the lead: The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls gave Mr. Trump 40.4% of the GOP primary vote in California to Mr. Cruz's 31.4% and Mr. Kasich's 15.8%.But with so many delegates awarded by congressional district, the campaigns are preparing to fight over the state as an amalgam of mini-primaries. Mr. Cruz has already been to California to campaign. He has two senior advisers who are former chairmen of the California Republican Party. His Cuban family roots could give him a leg up among the state's large population of Hispanic voters, although Mr. Cruz tends not to dwell on his ethnic background.Meantime, Mr. Trump's campaign is going through a shake-up, as newly hired Republican operatives Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley take more responsibility from campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Stuart Jolly, the national field director who was close to Mr. Lewandowski, resigned Monday. Mr. Jolly had never worked on a campaign before and had been asked to report to Mr. Wiley.Mr. Wiley is among the Trump officials headed to the Republican National Committee meeting this week in Florida, where officials will discuss potential rules changes to the party's convention in Cleveland.In addition to Messrs. Manafort and Wiley, the campaign is starting to hire other experienced staffers and dispatch them to states with upcoming primaries.---Reid J.

Election 2016: Trump's Campaign Spending on the Rise --- March expenditure rise leaves him far behind in building operations for general election,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783212937?accountid=12768,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump took steps last month to build out his political operation even as he touts a lean campaign on the trail. Yet his efforts, coming late in the presidential primary season, fall far short of those of his likely general-election opponent, Hillary Clinton, whose extensive operation whipped into action a full year ago.Mr. Trump spent nearly three times as much on field staff in March than in February, according to his report filed late Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission. His spending on telemarketing and voter-data operations tripled to nearly $800,000. March spending doubled on digital consultants -- to more than $1 million -- and advertising, which topped $6 million.Overall, Mr. Trump's $13.7 million in March spending was about 50% higher than a month earlier. But it still lagged behind by millions of dollars that of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Mrs. Clinton in past months.The increased spending marks a shift for Mr. Trump, who has largely eschewed paid advertising and instead directed his money to pay for his signature ""Make America Great Again"" hats and other merchandise and the cost of travel on the private jets he owns. He didn't begin spending money in earnest on TV ads until January, the month before the first nominating contests.Mr. Trump has repeatedly condemned the political class that makes its living running campaigns and has mocked former rivals, such as Jeb Bush, for spending millions of dollars with poor results. But the New York businessman now finds himself at a crossroad, with his lean, politically inexperienced staff outgunned by Mr. Cruz at state party gatherings where convention delegates are selected. Losing those intramural matches has put Mr. Trump in danger of not having enough delegates for a first-ballot victory at the party's July convention in Cleveland.While Mr. Trump's late efforts to build out his operation may be able to push him over the 1,237 delegate threshold required to win the nomination, he faces a challenge as he tries to turn toward an expected run against Mrs. Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.Mrs. Clinton spent more than $26 million from the start of her campaign through the end of March on more than 1,100 staffers and firms that provide digital and strategy consulting and voter-data services. In contrast, Mr. Trump paid just over $7 million to about 200 staffers and consulting firms through March -- less than half the $17 million GOP candidate Mitt Romney had spent on staff and consultants at this point in the 2012 election.""Trump keeps thinking he has broken the mold, and I'm not sure they have,"" said Stuart Stevens, a top adviser to Mr. Romney, who had effectively clinched the nomination by this point in the election four years ago.""You're talking about running a $1 billion to $2 billion startup that is going to have to be operational almost immediately, and that's just incredibly difficult to do,"" said Mr. Stevens, who opposes Mr. Trump's candidacy. ""Plus, he has created a culture that says he doesn't need to do this.""""If Trump is the nominee, he's going to run into a billion-dollar buzz saw"" in negative ads from Democrats and their allies, Mr. Stevens said. ""You have to be prepared for that.""Mr. Trump's fundraising operation is nontraditional: The billionaire has said he is willing to spend uncapped amounts on the campaign. So far, he has donated about $36 million to his campaign, making up nearly three-quarters of the funds he has raised so far. An additional $13 million came in donations. He has pegged his net worth at $10 billion, although that figure can't be confirmed independently.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has hired a veteran of several presidential campaigns, Paul Manafort, and one of former presidential candidate Scott Walker's top advisers, Rick Wiley. They are now hiring field staffers, a pollster and other campaign professionals considered essential even in congressional races. A presidential campaign that has taken up little real estate is opening a Washington, D.C. office in the next week and is opening multiple offices in states with upcoming primaries. One of the new hires, Rick Gates, a longtime Manafort aide, attended the now-weekly meeting with Mr. Trump's supporters on Capitol Hill Thursday morning.""I'm proud of the fact that I have a lot of money but spent much less money than these politicians,"" Mr. Trump said while campaigning Wednesday in Indianapolis.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus and Beth Reinhard",6/28/16
"Trump, GOP Grope Toward Unity",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783916865?accountid=12768,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- Donald Trump and his top aides have been trying privately to offer an olive branch to a GOP establishment that he has vilified. Many party insiders are wary of grasping it.Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, tried to bridge that divide Friday with a double-edged message: The stop-Trump forces should lay down their weapons, and Mr. Trump should stop attacking the party.""Politics is a team sport, and we can't win unless we rally around whoever becomes our nominee,"" Mr. Priebus said in a speech at an RNC meeting here. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, the chairman noted that GOP presidential candidates should think of themselves as ""trying out for our team.""""No one is forcing them to wear our jersey. We expect our candidates to support our party and our eventual nominee,"" he said.The GOP's longest-serving chairman was speaking to 168 of the party's most established and influential regulars, many of whom are just beginning to accept that the billionaire businessman could well be their presidential nominee. Besides his repeated trashing of the RNC and its chairman this month, some of Mr. Trump's policy stances and his incendiary rhetoric have rankled Republicans worried about his ability to win in November and his effect on down-ballot races.Senior Trump aides, bolstered by the front-runner's big win in this past week's New York primary and his expected strong showings in other northeastern contests next week, traveled to the conference to mend fences, calm anxieties and make what one state party official called a ""peace offering"" -- a promise to help raise money for the entire party and to work with the RNC.But many party insiders are waiting for the candidate who is making conciliatory gestures in private to change his tune in public.""They helped themselves a lot, but they will help themselves more when the candidate starts trying to unify Republicans from the stump more consistently,"" said Henry Barbour, an RNC member from Mississippi, of Mr. Trump and his team. ""He needs to do more if he wants to close this deal out.""Juliana Bergeron, an RNC member from New Hampshire who isn't committed to any candidate, said the three-day meeting here has helped calm some of her anxieties about a Trump nomination and the potential for tumult at the party convention this summer.""It depends on the day, how I feel about Donald Trump,"" she said. ""People are going with him, but it's a halfhearted approach.""Still, some seemed to be warming to Mr. Trump out of sheer professional admiration for his huge win in New York this past week.""This is 168 folks who love the inside baseball game,"" said Steve DuPrey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. ""The magnitude of the win in New York just before people came here started the buzz. People are impressed. The party will unite around whoever our winner is.""For state party officials, nothing matters more than whether the candidate at the top of the ticket can carry their states and lift other candidates down on the ballot in the general election. That is why the presidential candidates and their aides who came to the RNC meeting kept their focus on their strengths in the fall campaign.Speaking to GOP officials when he visited the RNC meeting, Ohio Gov. John Kasich argued that polls showed he was better equipped to beat Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, than any other candidate. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas focused on what he thought his candidacy would do for other Republicans down ballot, and he warned that the party could lose control of the Senate and even the House if Mr. Trump were at the top of the ticket.When Trump aides Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley met with RNC members Thursday evening, they tried to sell the New Yorker's campaign in pragmatic, general election terms.Mr. Wiley promised to ""use the unique magic of Trump to get beyond a traditional voter base."" He suggested Mr. Trump would make the party competitive in states that its presidential nominees haven't won in years, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.The Trump team's pitch at the RNC meeting is part of a behind-the-scenes effort to woo state party officials with assurances of fundraising and political help should he secure the nomination.Mr. Manafort, in meetings with state GOP chairs, has said the Trump campaign and state party officials should begin planning now to raise money in state races in late May. The campaign has met so far with officials in states including Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Nevada and Indiana.But Mr. Trump and his team still have a long way to go to heal the wounds inflicted by his bitter attacks on the party establishment. And some Republicans are anxious about what his nomination means for other GOP candidates.Trump causes a lot of down-ballot uncertainty,"" said Liesl Hickey, a former executive director of the House Republicans' campaign arm.""It'stoo soon to know exactly how problematic it will be at this point,but candidates in tough districts should be planning for the worst.""Mr. Trump's tirades against the delegate-selection process as ""rigged"" and ""corrupt"" has stung in states like Wyoming, which held a state party convention that, under procedures in place for decades, awarded almost all its delegates to Mr. Cruz.""I'm in a tough spot,"" said Wyoming GOP Chairman Matt Micheli. ""I will do what is best for my state. We know what a Hillary Clinton administration would mean to Wyoming.""In his speech, Mr. Priebus also made clear that the GOP shouldn't bow to Trump supporters' demand that he get the nomination even if he falls short of the 1,237 delegates needed to claim a majority and the nomination.""Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades,"" Mr. Priebus said.---Monica Langley and Patrick O'Connor contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook",6/29/16

His GOP rivals are hoping he doesn't win too big.Mr. Trump could sweep each of Connecticut's 28 delegates if he tops 50% of the vote. But if he falls below that figure, 13 delegates will be allocated proportionately among the candidates who get at least 20%. Each of the state's five congressional districts will also award three delegates, based on results within the district.""Keeping Trump under 50% statewide is critical,"" said John Weaver, chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, in a memo circulated among reporters.Mr. Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz seek to deny Mr. Trump the 1,237 delegates necessary to win the Republican nomination before the Cleveland convention.""We are in a world where you never know how important a couple of delegates will be,"" said State Sen. Joe Markley, a supporter of Mr. Cruz and one the state Legislature's most conservative members.The latest poll from Quinnipiac University had Mr. Trump with 48% support, Mr. Kasich at 28% and Mr. Cruz at 19%.""Small victories are going to be the key to the rest of the Cruz and Kasich strategy from here on out because it does not look promising for them at the convention right now,"" said Scott L. McLean, a political-science professor at Quinnipiac University.Fresh off his big win in New York on Tuesday, Mr. Trump's supporters are expecting similar success in Connecticut.""A lot of Connecticut citizens feel like they have some New York values too,"" said Jim Campbell, former chairman of the Greenwich Republican Town Committee.Mr. Trump is scheduled Saturday to make his second campaign stop in Connecticut with a rally in Waterbury and another in Bridgeport.Mr. Cruz has yet to make a campaign stop in the state.Mr. Kasich made his second stop in the state at a town hall in Glastonbury on Friday.

Election 2016: Clinton Pivots Toward Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783656184?accountid=12768,"JENKINTOWN, Pa. -- Hillary Clinton has yet to secure the delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, but the front-runner is increasingly turning to the themes likely to dominate a potential general election campaign against Donald Trump.In a campaign swing across Pennsylvaniaon Friday, Mrs. Clinton trained her fire not on her Democratic opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is trailing in the delegate count and facing an uphill battle, but on Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner who remains her most likely opponent in November.Mrs. Clinton positioned herself as the candidate best able to stand up to defend the groups of Americans that Mr. Trump has frequently singled out in his speeches -- previewing a line of attack that her campaign is sure to use if Mr. Trump becomes the Republican nominee.""I'm not going to respond to what he said about me. I'm going to respond to what he has said about women in general. I'm going to respond to what he has said about immigrants. I'm going to respond to what he has said about Muslims. I'm going to respond on behalf of all the people who have been the target of his hatred and his demagoguery,"" said Mrs. Clinton at a restaurant here in Jenkintown.Mrs. Clinton was referring to Mr. Trump's proposal to bar Muslims temporarily from entering the U.S., his comparison of illegal immigrants to rapists and a string of past comments about prominent women.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has increasingly professionalized his small campaign operation, bringing on board a veteran GOP operative and stepping up his outreach to party regulars. Despite an off-the-cuff oratory style that has propelled him to the top of the Republican primary field, he has said that he will add teleprompters and a speechwriter to his staff to give him more message discipline going forward.Mr. Trump, speaking to Fox News in an interview scheduled to air on Saturday, appeared prepared for Mrs. Clinton's attacks -- previewing his own general-election case against her by giving her the moniker ""Crooked Hillary.""""The only thing she's got going is the women card,"" he said. ""Without the women card, she's got nothing going, and she's gonna play it to the hilt, and I'm gonna be talking about things, and one of the things I talk about is, we call her Crooked Hillary because she's a crooked person -- she's always been a crooked person,"" he said in the interview.Mrs. Clinton has been dogged by the revelation that she exclusively used a personal email server while serving as secretary of state, which wasn't illegal, but was discouraged by the government. She has also been attacked by Mr. Sanders for taking large speaking fees from major banks and corporations, and her family foundation's ties to business and foreign governments have drawn Republican criticism.Female voters were paramount during Mrs. Clinton's stop in Jenkins, where she convened a roundtable discussion with more than two dozen women to discuss everything from equal pay to gun control. The stop included an appearance with Lilly Ledbetter, the plaintiff in a landmark pay-discrimination case who later became an activist for equal pay between men and women. Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Ledbetter a ""heroine of the equal pay movement"" and invited her to address the crowd.That Mrs. Clinton has chosen Pennsylvania to make an aggressive case against Mr. Trump comes as the state has emerged as a potential general-election battleground.Mr. Trump's best path to the presidency might run through states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin -- Rust Belt states that have trended Democratic in recent years, but where Mr. Trump's advantages with blue-collar white voters might offset his high negatives among female and nonwhite voters. Mr. Trump and his supporters believe white, working-class voters can be mobilized to turn out in higher levels than they have in previous cycles.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau",6/29/16
Donald Trump: Roles of a Lifetime,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783656179?accountid=12768,"Measured against past presidential campaigns, it may be said that this one has been unpresidential. We say that not to deride any particular candidacy but merely to acknowledge the strikingly new models of presidential appeal that have appeared this year, in both parties.It is all taking some getting used to, as was clear from the remarks at the GOP's national committee meeting in Florida this week by Paul Manafort, an old political hand, now described as Donald Trump's new delegate wrangler, an apt term.For starters, Mr. Manafort's remarks about his boss were supposed to be private to the committee members, a notion that has lost its meaning in the age of the smartphone. Mr. Manafort was recorded saying of Mr. Trump: ""The part that he's been playing is evolving into the part that now you've been expecting, but he wasn't ready for."" He added: ""You'll start to see more depth of the person, the real person. You'll see a real different guy.""Mr. Manafort, whose presidential pedigree runs back to the Gerald Ford campaign against Ronald Reagan in 1976, is describing a time-honored practice. Candidates feel obliged in the primaries to run right or left to appease their party's vocal outer limits. Then they move to the center for the general election.Mr. Trump's politics are unique, and saying that he is going to start acting more presidential would be a rough proxy for this unusual candidate moving toward the center.Here's one problem. This isn't 1976 anymore. In the 24/7 electronic age, with numerous public debates, candidate personas get pounded relentlessly into the nation's psyche. The traditional ""pivot"" is harder than it used to be. Ask Hillary Clinton.Socialist Bernie Sanders has forced Secretary Clinton to try to outbid his left-wing politics loudly and constantly. A ""centrist"" Hillary come this fall will be hard to believe.Ted Cruz, reacting to the Manafort promise of ""the real person,"" mocked Mr. Trump as ""just a show."" But Senator Cruz is also now straining to convince ""establishment"" Republicans that his assault on them, starting with his ostentatious government shutdown, was just . . . well, something they should now forget.Some things still don't change in politics. Mr. Trump's candidacy is imperiled by the significant resistance to it by two-thirds of the national electorate, as polls keep reporting. That's what Mr. Manafort gets. Pushing those bad numbers toward normalcy is now Mr. Trump's greatest presidential challenge.",6/29/16

""The jump for them is extraordinarily high from where they are today to where we think they ought to be,"" Mr. McDevitt said.Mr. Icahn, who gained control of the Trump Taj Mahal in bankruptcy, couldn't be reached Thursday to discuss the new agreement with the Tropicana, or the continued negotiations with the Taj Mahal.Three other Atlantic City casinos weren't under a strike threat . They are the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, Resorts Casino Hotel and Golden Nugget Atlantic City.The Atlantic City casino industry has suffered for years, its business eroded by tough economic times and new competition in neighboring states. The eight casinos that survived the downturn are headed back to profitability, according to the union.

"Map Shrinks for Trump Foes --- As GOP front-runner eyes Tuesday sweep, Cruz, Kasich pin fading hopes on Indiana vote",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784024579?accountid=12768,"ROCKVILLE, Md. -- Donald Trump is poised to sweep five states' Republican primaries on the Eastern Seaboard on Tuesday, but his rivals are already looking ahead to next week's contest in Indiana, which may be their last chance to keep Mr. Trump from clinching the party's presidential nomination.Polls have shown Mr. Trump leading in Indiana, which votes on May 3. But Sen. Ted Cruz now might have a better shot at beating Mr. Trump in the state, which has 57 delegates, because the Texas senator struck a deal on Sunday with John Kasich that calls for the Ohio governor not to compete in the Hoosier state.It is a must-win state for anti-Trump forces. If Mr. Trump wins in Indiana after his expected victories on Tuesday, it will be much harder for his rivals to keep him from garnering the 1,237 pledged delegates he needs to win the Republican presidential nomination.The GOP front-runner has already held one rally in Indianapolis and plans to be there again Wednesday, where his campaign said he would appear with former Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight, a revered figure in the state.Money is pouring into Indiana. According to a person who tracks media ad buys, the Trump campaign has spent nearly $800,000 on television and radio ads in Indiana. Two anti-Trump PACs have each spent roughly the same amount, and a pro-Cruz super PAC has spent more than $1 million attacking Mr. Kasich. Mr. Cruz's campaign on Monday bought up $903,000 in air time in the state.Mr. Trump is likely to go there with a strong wind at his back after Tuesday, when he is favored to win in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Those states will be sending 172 delegates to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, and could add to Mr. Trump's momentum after a big win in New York last week.Mr. Cruz all but threw in the towel on the five-state primary by spending Monday campaigning in Indiana, a state more receptive to his evangelical conservative message than the more-liberal brand of Republicanism in states favoring Mr. Trump.""The entire country, its eyes are on this great state to choose which path do we want to go down,"" Mr. Cruz said in Borden, Ind., a day after announcing the last-ditch effort with Mr. Kasich to block Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump attacked his rivals over their plan to coordinate campaign strategy against him. ""It shows how weak they are. It shows how pathetic they are,"" Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in Rhode Island. ""It takes two guys, longtime politicians to get together to try to beat Trump, and yet they're way behind.""The Cruz-Kasich agreement, announced by campaign aides Sunday night, calls for Mr. Kasich to back away from campaigning in Indiana in exchange for the Cruz campaign staying out of Oregon's primary on May 17 and New Mexico's on June 7.Still, in a sign of the tenuousness of the deal, Mr. Kasich on Monday stopped short of asking his supporters in Indiana to vote for Mr. Cruz, and described the deal as a prudent allocation of campaign resources. Both the Cruz and Kasich campaigns asked their supportive super PACs to follow their lead.""We want to get to an open convention so we can beat Hillary,"" Mr. Kasich said in an interview after his Rockville rally here on Monday. ""That's what this is all about. I don't want Hillary Clinton to be president, and I think if we go to an open convention, they're going to look at who can win and who can actually run the country.""Both Trump challengers are facing a stark political reality: The New York businessman, despite being unpopular with party leaders, is the only candidate who has any chance of securing a majority of pledged delegates before the party's convention.Mr. Trump now has 845 bound delegates, those who are required to back him on the first ballot at the convention. Mr. Cruz has 559 delegates and Mr. Kasich 148. With no chance of achieving the 1,237 majority, the Trump rivals' only strategy is to force a contested convention that goes beyond a first ballot.""When you have the kind of front-runner who two-thirds of Republican voters don't agree with, you have to go to an open convention,"" said David Beightol, a George H.W. Bush administration veteran who came to see Mr. Kasich at a Monday afternoon town hall event in Rockville. ""It's the only option for us now.""Mr. Cruz, whose team had rejected past overtures to make such a deal, has only recently conceded that he had no path to win the nomination outright. At this point, he said in Indiana, the deal with Kasich is ""dedicated to the primary goal of being able to beat Hillary Clinton.""""It is abundantly clear that nobody is getting to 1,237,"" he said. ""We are headed to a contested convention.""Of the 57 delegates at stake in Indiana, 30 are awarded to the candidate who wins the most votes statewide; the other 27 are awarded to the winner in each of the nine congressional districts.Despite the Kasich campaign's agreement to avoid Indiana -- he canceled a planned Tuesday swing though the state -- Mr. Kasich on Monday refused a suggestion that he tell his Indiana supporters to back Mr. Cruz.""I've said all that I have to say about this,"" he said in the Rockville interview. ""I don't tell voters how to vote. They decide and make up their own minds as they do.""There are inherent dangers for Messrs. Cruz and Kasich in a public collaboration to block Mr. Trump. To some voters, the deal could reek of collusion -- a charge Mr. Trump made on Monday.""I think it's desperation. It makes no sense,"" said Kevin Hunter of Rockville, a Republican who said Monday that he is undecided between the three candidates. ""For Kasich and Cruz to agree to this after going off on each other for so long makes them look like hypocrites. . . . It just blows my mind that Kasich is going to agree to this deal.""Mr. Trump, whose aides have claimed he would be striking a more ""presidential"" pose, made fun of Mr. Kasich's eating habits Monday and continued with his penchant for giving derogatory nicknames to his rivals. He said in Rhode Island that he would be calling Mr. Kasich ""1-for-41,"" in reference to his losing record in the primaries and caucuses outside his home state of Ohio.""Very soon, it's going to be 1 for 46 or 7,"" Mr. Trump added.---Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook and Reid J.

"Election 2016: Poll Finds Front-Runners Have Big Leads --- Trump, Clinton could boost their delegate counts Tuesday in Pennsylvania primary",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783848514?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton looked poised to build on their momentum-shifting wins in New York with victories in the Pennsylvania primaries Tuesday, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll shows.Mr. Trump leads the Republican field in Pennsylvania as the top choice of 45% of likely GOP primary voters, the poll shows, outpacing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, with 27%, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 24%.In the Democratic race, Mrs. Clinton leads Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 55%- 40%, among likely primary voters.For Republicans, the statewide results in Pennsylvania -- one of five states voting Tuesday in New England and the Mid-Atlantic region -- could turn out to be more symbolic than binding. No matter which candidate wins Tuesday, 54 of the state's 71 delegates will be free to back whomever they choose at the party's national nominating convention in Cleveland this summer.Since ballots won't list specific candidates next to contenders for these 54 convention delegate seats, Mr. Trump's website lists the names of 41 of them in 15 congressional districts it says would back him in July in Cleveland.The Democratic contest in Pennsylvania is more straightforward, with 189 pledged delegates up for grabs. They will be divided based on the candidates' statewide performance and their finish in each of the state's 18 congressional districts.""Trump and Clinton are both positioned to win the popular vote,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ""For Democrats, it's all about delegate counts. But, for Republicans, the popular vote doesn't guarantee a big chunk of the delegates at the convention.""The survey results undercut Mr. Trump's argument in recent weeks that he can put Pennsylvania and other Rust Belt states in play in a general-election matchup this fall with Mrs. Clinton. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Mrs. Clinton beats Mr. Trump, 54% to 39%, the poll found. The margin is even wider in a contest between Messrs. Trump and Sanders.Of the three Republicans who remain in the race, only Mr. Kasich leads the Democratic front-runner, Mrs. Clinton. He holds a narrow, 48% to 45% edge.Mr. Trump's voters are more committed than those of his remaining rivals, with 72% of his backers saying they ""strongly support"" him. His support in the state is broad and is strongest among men, voters age 45 or older and those without a college degree.As in many prior races, Mr. Trump's support is weaker among women, college graduates and voters who rate themselves ""very conservative,"" a group that Mr. Cruz carries.The mostly moderate Philadelphia suburbs represent the most fertile terrain for Mr. Trump's rivals to try to pick off delegates. Mr. Trump is the preferred pick of 38% of likely primary voters in those communities outside Philadelphia, just four percentage-points better than Mr. Kasich, at 34%. A quarter of the suburban voters favor Mr. Cruz.The poll shows Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator and secretary of state, garnering twice as much support from African-American voters as does Mr. Sanders. And she has big leads among women, self-identified Democrats and primary voters age 45 and older.Mr. Sanders, for his part, has big leads among younger voters and the most liberal primary voters.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",7/1/16
Information Age: Trump Models for Open Borders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1783848461?accountid=12768,"""I'm on a 1 visa -- 'extraordinary abilities,'"" the Swedish model says, rolling her eyes: "" 'Extraordinary ability' is not really what models are. That's what I think at least. So it's kind of a tricky situation.""The young woman, in an interview with the new Heat Street website, was referring to the H-1B work visa for ""exceptional ability in the sciences, arts or business."" She is represented by Trump Models, one of 250 women for whom Donald Trump's agencies sought such visas, according to Reuters. Heat Street reports that most of the women represented by Trump Models were born outside the U.S., including Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, who came to the U.S. from Slovenia on an H-1B.Mr. Trump's signature campaign pledge is closing borders. Last week, his new top adviser, Paul Manafort, told the Republican National Committee that the candidate has been playing a role and not to believe everything he says.""When he's out on the stage, when he's talking about the kinds of things he's talking about on the stump, he's projecting an image that's for that purpose,"" Mr. Manafort said. ""The part that he's been playing is evolving into the part that now you've been expecting. . . . The image is going to change.""On the work-visa issue, it has already been changing, more or less constantly. Last summer the Trump campaign issued an immigration plan opposing H-1B visas. It includes this criticism: ""Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs.""Mr. Trump was asked in the March 3 presidential debate if he stood by his opposition to these H-1B visas. ""I'm changing,"" he replied. ""We need highly skilled people in this country. . . . We do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have.""He added: ""One of the biggest problems we have is people will go to the best colleges, they'll go to Harvard, they'll go to Stanford, to Wharton, as soon as they are finished they get shoved out. They want to stay in this country. They want to stay here desperately. They are not able to stay here. For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country.""Within hours Mr. Trump had changed again, saying in a statement: ""I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions."" In another debate, on March 10, Mr. Trump called H-1B visas ""very, very bad for workers.""That's nonsense. For companies, it wouldn't be worth the expense of filing for visas if there were Americans available for the jobs. The labor isn't cheap, either: Engineers holding H-1Bs earn an average of 10% more than the national average.The H-1B visa is critical for Silicon Valley to keep its innovative edge by recruiting and retaining the best talent. The annual nationwide cap of 65,000 H-1B visas is a fraction of qualified applications. This year it was filled in five business days.Even with restrictions, immigrants founded 44% of Silicon Valley companies -- and most of the startups that are now worth more than $1 billion. Congress has been willing to expand visas for skilled workers and attach a green card to every advanced degree in science or technology. But President Obama has held these reforms hostage to full immigration-reform legislation.Many Americans remember a Republican president who spoke eloquently about an ideal that was the opposite of closing borders and putting up walls. This is how Ronald Reagan -- the last president to get broad immigration reform passed -- concluded his farewell speech in 1989:""I've spoken of the 'Shining City' all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace, a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it and see it still.""Mr. Manafort's claims notwithstanding, it's hard to imagine Mr. Trump playing the role of Reagan on immigration. But the story of Trump Models demonstrates that, in real life at least, he understands the value of an open door.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: It's High Time to End the Abuse of H-1B Visas"" -- WSJ May. 11, 2016)Credit: By L.

"Why Donald Trump, as President, Wouldn't Face Conflict-of-Interest Laws; Nation's founders didn't want limits on their actions",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801493837?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's complex businesses raise the potential for conflicts of interest if he were elected, but the U.S. president and vice president aren't subject to laws that apply to nearly all other federal officials.The reason for that dates to the nation's founding, said Norman Eisen, fellow at Brookings Institution and the Obama administration's former ethics counsel. The ""decision-making of the founding fathers was replete with what today we would call conflicts of interest,"" he said, noting that early presidents made decisions on agriculture policy and slavery despite owning large plantations.""Because the president of the United States is the single most consequential decision maker on the planet, Congress has decided his hands shouldn't be tied on any issue because of conflicts of interest over any potential financial or personal gain,"" Mr. Eisen said.Other executive-branch officials must recuse themselves on certain issues and divest themselves of certain investments. For example, when former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Henry Paulson was appointed as Treasury secretary in 2006, he sold about $500 million worth of Goldman stock to adhere to conflict-of-interest rules. Even though presidents don't have to comply to these rules, they have historically respected the need to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest and typically have set up blind trusts. The laws, however, require extensive disclosures for transparency and oversight, says Richard Painter, the former ethics counsel to President George W. Bush.The closest example of an elected official who controlled and largely owned an operating concern was former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who resigned from all management and board positions at his companies before taking office. The city's Conflicts Board required him to ""have no involvement in the day-to-day operations"" of Bloomberg LP. But it permitted him to ""participate in major decisions,"" which he did when Businessweek was acquired, according to his spokesman.Write to Monica Langley at monica.langley@wsj.comRelated* Trump's Complex Business Ties Could Set New PrecedentCredit: By Monica Langley",7/5/16
Trump Taj Mahal Casino Workers Strike in Atlantic City; Four others casinos up and running after reaching tentative terms with union earlier this week,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800776069?accountid=12768,"Workers at the Trump Taj Mahal casino and hotel in Atlantic City walked off the job early Friday morning and took to picket lines after contract negotiations broke down this week.Unite Here Local 54, the union representing nearly 1,000 Taj workers, organized the strike after determining that the casino, owned by activist investor Carl Icahn, wasn't offering a serious proposal to cover their health insurance, union spokesman Ben Begleiter said.The company said in the statement that it was bargaining ""in good faith"" with the union and threatened that the casino might close as a result of the strike.The Taj wasn't accepting hotel reservations for the next 10 days on its website as of Friday afternoon. A company official said in the statement that the casino was fully open and welcoming guests through the July 4 holiday weekend and beyond.Four Atlantic City casinos , including another one owned by Mr. Icahn, avoided a threatened strike after coming to tentative terms with the union earlier this week . The union had earlier determined that it wouldn't strike the city's three other casinos. There are eight casinos currently operating in the gambling enclave.Full health coverage has long been a mainstay for casino workers, who have traditionally been able to achieve stable, middle-class service-industry jobs in gambling hot spots such as Atlantic City and Las Vegas.But that has broken down somewhat, especially in Atlantic City, whose casino industry has been hit hard by bankruptcies, private-equity ownership and the expansion of gambling elsewhere in the mid-Atlantic region. Four casinos in Atlantic City have closed in recent years.The Taj, opened by Donald Trump in 1990, emerged from bankruptcy, filed in 2014, earlier this year with Mr. Icahn taking over ownership of the company, called Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. Mr. Trump lost control of the casino more than a decade ago. The latest bankruptcy was the casino's fourth.Mr. Icahn won in bankruptcy court approval to eliminate union pensions and health-insurance benefits , arguing that restoring them would force him to close the casino. The decision was upheld earlier this year by a federal appeals court.In a recent survey, the union found that one-third of Taj workers had no health insurance, while 50% were on taxpayer-subsidized insurance, Mr. Begleiter of the union said.""Historically there has been free family health care and workers have given up wages over the years to maintain that,"" Mr. Begleiter said. That is why, he said, ""when Taj took [the health insurance] away it was like a double slap in the face. Health insurance has always been the No. 1 issue among our workers.""Taj Chief Executive Tony Rodio said in a statement that the company had offered health benefits that included employer contributions.""The employees of the Taj Bargaining Committee seem hellbent on trying to close this property and killing the jobs and livelihood of the other Taj employees including their own union members and members of other unions notwithstanding the fact that Taj ownership has presented good faith concrete progressive proposals to restore certain employee benefits including contributions toward employee health care,"" Mr. Rodio said.""They are hurting their own and everybody else during the busiest time of the year.""The health-care situation at the Taj had complicated negotiations with other casinos because the union contracts allow other casinos to adopt the contract that is most advantageous to the employer, several people involved in negotiations for casinos and the union said.Despite that, the union earlier in the week came to tentative contract agreements with Caesars Entertainment Corp., which owns three casinos in Atlantic City, and the Tropicana casino, also owned by Mr. Icahn. The union decided not to strike those properties as a result. Those tentative deals still need to be presented to the union's workers, union officials said. They include maintaining full free health coverage, Mr. Begleiter said.The previous strike in Atlantic City occurred in 2004, when 10,000 workers went on strike against seven Atlantic City casinos, and lasted 34 days.Write to Alexandra Berzon at alexandra.berzon@wsj.comCredit: By Alexandra Berzon",7/5/16
"Front-Runners March On --- Trump Sweeps All Five Races, Building Big Delegate Lead",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784402790?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump trounced his rivals up and down the Eastern Seaboard on Tuesday, winning five Republican presidential primaries that provide a shot of adrenaline for the home stretch of a campaign he has dominated from the start.Mr. Trump was declared the winner in the Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island primaries, a rout that leaves him close to having an insurmountable lead in his quest for the 1,237 delegates needed to nail down the GOP nomination.""I consider myself the presumptive nominee, absolutely,"" Mr. Trump said at a victory rally in New York. ""We should heal the Republican Party.""His five-state win was expected, but early returns suggested he would rack up some of his biggest winning margins of the year, even bigger in some states than the 60.4% victory he scored last week in New York.Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Trump had 845 bound delegates, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz had 559 and Ohio Gov. John Kasich held 148. That meant Mr. Trump had to win about 65% of remaining bound delegates to reach the delegate target.The exact number of delegates allocated to each candidate after Tuesday's contests will depend in part on vote breakdowns in individual congressional districts. But Mr. Trump was in position to pick up at least 110 of the 118 bound delegates up for grabs in the five states.Still, Mr. Trump in the coming weeks will have to fight through a series of potentially less-friendly states holding contests in May -- Indiana, Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon and Washington -- and can't reach that delegate threshold before the last day of primary voting June 7, when the five states voting include California.His nearest rival, Mr. Cruz, was on track to place third in some if not most of the five states voting Tuesday. Even before the polls closed, Mr. Cruz was looking forward to Indiana and beyond. ""Tonight this campaign moves back to more favorable terrain,"" he said at a rally in Knightstown, Ind.Mr. Kasich's top strategist, John Weaver, also cautioned against a premature coronation. ""Tonight proves one thing: this race will come down to June 7,"" he said in a memo. ""The truth is Donald Trump has no margin for error.""Messrs. Cruz and Kasich still have a chance to collect enough delegates to block Mr. Trump from getting the 1,237 needed for a first-ballot victory at the Cleveland convention in July. But each week presents another potential Waterloo for the stop-Trump forces, who can't afford another loss.Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump group, said Tuesday's results were expected and their efforts would continue. ""With Kasich and Cruz showing signs of cooperation and more challenging terrain ahead for Trump, this race is going all the way to Cleveland,"" a group memo said.Mr. Trump and his supporters have argued there would be a huge political backlash if he is the leading delegate- and vote-getter and is denied the nomination. Public opinion seems to be moving in his direction, as polls show increasing acceptance among Republicans for his candidacy.""As far as I'm concerned, it's over,"" said Mr. Trump, who said he wasn't planning to change his persona, as some of this campaign aides have suggested he would. He said he hadn't yet begun considering who would be his running mate, but that he would set up a committee to begin the process ""in the not too distant future.""In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, the share of GOP primary voters who say they would be satisfied with Mr. Trump as the nominee jumped to 63% in April, up 10 points in a month. And the share who could see themselves supporting him rose 5 points, to about equal with Messrs. Cruz and Kasich.A weekly tracking poll by NBC News/Survey Monkey reported Tuesday that support for Mr. Trump among Republicans and GOP-leaning voters hit 50% for the first time since the survey started in late December. That finding and his commanding victories in the Tuesday primaries undercut the claim of his rivals that Mr. Trump has a ceiling of support that will keep him from garnering a majority in the party.""I know people view him as crass, but I'm tired of the typical political nonsense,"" said Dave Rothfield, 57, a retired radiologist and Trump supporter in Gaithersburg, Md. ""Everybody portrays people who support him as uneducated slobs who don't know what they're talking about. But a lot of them are like me, people who follow this stuff closely and are tired of what they're seeing.""Mr. Trump may be benefiting from voter backlash against the Cruz and Kasich campaigns for saying this week they would coordinate campaign strategy to improve their chances of stopping the New York businessman's momentum.""I just think they are backstabbers,"" said Phyllis Mooney, 75, a retiree in Danbury, Conn., who voted for Mr. Trump. ""They are just doing what they have to do, regardless of what they say or whatever, to get Trump out.""In Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump will pick up only 17 of the state's 71 delegates. The other 54 will go to the convention not bound to any candidate, under the state's decades-old system that leaves delegates free to vote as they choose.The arrangement was confusing for voters because the state's ballots listed delegate candidates with no indication if they supported a particular candidate.The Trump and Cruz campaigns put out lists of Pennsylvania delegates it believed would be their supporters. One of those on the Trump list, Tom Uram, 56, said he was ""all in"" for Mr. Trump. The senior financial services representative for MetLife Inc. said he has been a delegate or an alternate delegate at all the Republican National Conventions since 1980.He said he would cast a ballot for Mr. Trump ""until the bitter end"" if there were a contested convention. However, he predicted Mr. Trump would win enough delegates in the remaining primaries to secure the nomination.""I think he's going to hit the magic number on the first ballot, and I want to be there to cast the vote,"" Mr. Uram said.Mr. Kasich's record in neighboring Ohio helped him pick up some votes in Pennsylvania.""I look at Ohio, and John Kasich came in and really turned that state around,"" said Ann Dugan, 61, former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business. ""We need to move away from beauty contests and hyperbole. I think we need a leader that understands the process and the art of the possible.""---Reid J.

Trump's Eastern Sweep,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784402768?accountid=12768,"If Donald Trump wins the Republican presidential nomination, he'll owe a special debt to his neighbors in the eastern U.S. The New Yorker swept five more New England and mid-Atlantic states on Tuesday, following his New York romp last week, and bringing him closer to the 1,237 delegates he needs to win on the first ballot at the Cleveland convention.Mr. Trump's eastern sweep has helped him recover from his Wisconsin defeat three weeks ago, all the more so because he won so convincingly. New York was the first state in which he won more than 50% of the vote, but on Tuesday as we went to press he was comfortably above a majority in all five states. He won another 105 or so delegates to get close to 950 with 10 more state contests to go.The businessman's nearly 60% victory in Pennsylvania was especially impressive given that he was barely above 30% in the polls three weeks ago. Yet on Tuesday he crushed John Kasich and Ted Cruz among all age and income groups, according to the exit polls. He also swept all GOP ideological groups, while Mr. Kasich couldn't make headway with conservatives and Mr. Cruz appealed only to the most conservative.The results showed the continuing limits of Mr. Cruz's appeal among suburban, non-religious voters, which wouldn't bode well for the general election against Hillary Clinton. His Wisconsin victory was an opportunity to broaden his appeal and emerge as Mr. Trump's main competitor. But the Texas Senator is paying a price for his strategy of polarization and claiming to be the only true conservative in the race. As a political outsider, he's being Trumped.The Pennsylvania result is also a notable disappointment for Mr. Kasich, who was born in the state and governs next door in Ohio. But he never could raise enough money to compete across the giant state's media markets, and his biographical emphasis as an experienced politician who knows how to get along with Democrats has never caught on this outsider year.Mr. Kasich is right that he's the only remaining candidate who beats Mrs. Clinton in the current head-to-head polls, but GOP voters tell exit pollsters they think Mr. Trump has the best chance to win. Believing isn't always seeing clearly in politics.Mr. Trump's sweep sets him up for what may be a do-or-die showdown next Tuesday in Indiana against Mr. Cruz. Mr. Kasich has agreed to give the Texan a one-on-one shot against the New Yorker in the Hoosier state, which has more conservatives than the northeast.Mr. Cruz tried to appeal to those voters Tuesday night by comparing Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton as ""flip sides of the same coin,"" but we wonder how believable that will be. Most Republicans by now know that Mr. Trump has no consistent philosophy. They support him because they think he has the best chance to blow up the Washington status quo.Mr. Trump's continuing challenge will be to repair his battered image among the third or more Republicans who say they will never vote for him. His negative approval ratings are unmatched in the history of modern presidential politics.

Politics & Ideas: How Trump Killed Reaganism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784402464?accountid=12768,"The minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential primaries threatens to obscure the larger story: While Sen. Bernie Sanders is pressing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to move further and faster down the progressive road, Donald Trump is waging and winning the third major revolution in the Republican Party since World War II.In 1952, the factions favoring Dwight Eisenhower clashed with the fervent supporters of Ohio Sen. Robert Taft. With the victory of Gen. Eisenhower's ""modern Republicanism,"" the GOP made its peace with the essentials of the New Deal and with anticommunist internationalism, setting the stage for more than two decades of consensus politics.Speaking at Yale University's commencement in 1962, President Kennedy declared that ""the central issues of our time relate not to basic clashes of philosophy or ideology but to ways and means of reaching common goals."" The issues between the two parties had become ""matters of degree,"" he said -- the debate concerned the ""technical questions"" needed to keep a ""great economic machinery moving forward."" After taking the U.S. off the gold standard in 1971, President Nixon famously announced: ""I am now a Keynesian in economics.""We know what happened next. The Vietnam War destroyed the Cold War foreign-policy consensus. Stagflation did the same for the Keynesian economic consensus. The rise of the counterculture, the civil-rights movement, feminism and a bevy of social issues broke the duopoly of silence that had largely kept these divisive issues off the public agenda.With these new concerns, the stage was set for the Reagan Revolution -- the remarkable fusion of supply-side economics, anti-Soviet internationalism and social conservatism that framed American politics until Barack Obama's election. Those ideas dominated the Republican Party until the beginning of the contest for its presidential nomination last year.Underlying the success of the Reagan fusion was the shift of the white working class -- the heart of the New Deal coalition -- to the Republican side. Racial, cultural and foreign-policy concerns largely drove this realignment. Economic issues were secondary, which permitted business-oriented Republican elites to dominate their party's economic agenda with free trade, a welcoming immigration policy and efforts to ""reform"" -- that is, cut -- major entitlement programs. As late as George W. Bush's second term, these concerns remained paramount.With the onset of the Great Recession, however, the alliance between the white working class and business elites began to fray. Workers blamed trade for the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs, and blamed immigrants for declining wages as well as for rising welfare expenditures and social disorder. Amid rising economic uncertainty, these voters were in no mood to put their remaining sources of economic reassurance -- Social Security and Medicare -- on the chopping block. ""Limited government"" meant cutting programs for the undeserving poor, not for working- and middle-class households.Enter Donald Trump, who proposes to turn Reaganism on its head. Sen. Ted Cruz is right: Mr. Trump is no social conservative. He does indeed espouse ""New York values,"" especially the Big Apple's relaxed attitudes on gay and transgender issues. His pro-life sentiments are a day old and an inch deep, and his religious commitments are hard to discern.Nor is Mr. Trump an internationalist. He rejects U.S. alliances and commitments as unaffordable burdens, and he regards Russia's Vladimir Putin as a kindred spirit. He espouses the spirit if not (yet) the letter of Charles Lindbergh's motto: America First.In economics, Mr. Trump rejects current trade treaties as bad bargains struck by inept U.S. negotiators and paints immigration as an assault on American workers and society itself. He doesn't appear to care about the budget deficit and rejects cuts to Social Security and Medicare. In a rare bow to Republican orthodoxy, he has proposed a deep tax cut, but it is hardly at the center of his agenda. Few take it seriously.In President Reagan's first inaugural address, he declared that ""In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."" That isn't Mr. Trump's view; he opposes not big government, but rather ""stupid"" government, presenting himself as the cure for stupidity.Nor is he what the conservative movement dubs a ""constitutionalist."" How could he be, when he seems to believe that the U.S. government has at most one branch, whose powers he views even more expansively than does President Obama?Mr. Trump's candidacy has showed that the cadre of genuine social conservatives is smaller than long assumed, that grass-roots Republican support for large military commitments in the Middle East has withered, and that the business community is politically homeless.So it has come to this: A mercantilist isolationist is the odds-on favorite to win the Republican presidential nomination. Whether or not he goes on to win the general election, the Republican Party cannot return to what it once was. The Reagan era has ended, and what comes next is anyone's guess.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Reaganism Will Endure Because of Its Sound Values"" -- WSJ May 9, 2015)Credit: By William A.

Hillary's Debt to Sanders and Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784402245?accountid=12768,"Even before the air-clearing April 19 New York primary in which Bernie Sanders was trounced and Donald Trump was a big winner, word had come of a more presidential Trump soon to be revealed. The unveiling came with Mr. Trump's victory speech, an event that occasioned near-universal excitement when the candidate used the word ""senator"" in front of Ted Cruz's name -- a reaction that said a good deal about Mr. Trump and his campaign, all of it deeply familiar.Mr. Trump's image refurbishing promises to become a show all its own, fascinating to behold, albeit with slim prospects of success. The same would be true for Bernie Sanders, also being pressed now to improve his tone -- the nudging being another of the many things the two have in common in addition to the main thing, namely the enormous role both have played in advancing Hillary Clinton's progress toward the White House.Mr. Sanders is being urged, in the interest of Democratic unity, to temper his assaults on Hillary Clinton as a pawn of Wall Street and servant of special interests -- no easy matter for a lifelong ideologue of the far left. But no accusation transmits more of a sense of high moral indignation than the regular reminders that Mrs. Clinton voted for the Iraq war in 2002 and that he did not -- a fact Mr. Sanders cites, by way of response, when facing questions about his qualifications for the presidency as compared with those of Mrs. Clinton.To hear him again and again on Sen. Clinton's war vote is to be struck by the unvarying intensity Mr. Sanders brings to the charge, the tone of a man delivering a bombshell, and one, for him, that never loses its power. His capacity to stay on message to the exclusion of all other concerns has been conspicuous throughout his campaign.When news came in November that the topics for the Des Moines, Iowa, debate among the Democratic contenders would be reordered to include national security and terrorism, no one was taken aback. No one that is but the Sanders campaign, which made bitter protest to CBS, the debate host, over this sudden change in the agreed-on lineup of subjects.The other two scheduled debaters, including Martin O'Malley, had no complaints. The broadcast would take place one night after the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris in which 130 people had been killed and hundreds wounded. It was inconceivable that a nationally televised presidential debate would fail to include a focus on this latest rampage of horror. For Mr. Sanders and his team, the Paris attacks were in the way, an expenditure of time and attention that cut into his opportunity to hold forth on the guiding principles of his campaign.The debate opened on the subject of Paris, with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O'Malley contributing detailed commentaries. Mr. Sanders declared that he was shocked and disgusted by the attacks, and that the world must be rid of ISIS -- observations he immediately followed with the announcement that he was running for president: ""because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people and what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.""Mr. Sanders then contributed his now well-known belief that the greatest threat to national security is climate change -- this along with several reminders that he had voted against the war in Iraq. The war, he declared, was responsible for the rise in terrorism.Was he, debate moderator John Dickerson wanted to know, actually now making a direct link between Mrs. Clinton's vote for the Iraq war and what was happening with ISIS, with terrorism? Mr. Sanders's reply left no doubt that this was exactly his view.In the days before the New York primary, crowds of Sanders supporters gathered in Manhattan's Washington Square Park. They were young, overwhelmingly white, trapped in a solid claustrophobic mass stretching for blocks, and happy to be there. They were largely college and high-school students, members of his most visible and devoted constituency.In an era when the young emerge from years of schooling that portrays the U.S. as the world's leading threat to peace and justice in the world -- as a militarist aggressor awash in racism, in a system run by and for Wall Street -- the Sanders campaign was a magnet. Long instructed in the progressive faith that is now established religion on the nation's campuses, they found in Mr. Sanders's politics, and his view of American society, a confirmation of all they have been taught.It becomes clearer as the Sanders and Trump campaigns roll on how great the similarity is in the picture of America conjured by those two visionaries -- an image of America the bleak, a broken society, weak, lost, oppressed by the weight of injustice and losing everywhere in the world, as Mr. Trump reports.The two have in common, as well, their conspicuous resistance to all questions, all requests for some fragment of information on the specifics of their planned goals: to make America great again, folks (Mr. Trump's trope), and a future we can believe in (Mr. Sanders's).Nothing was clearer in Mr. Sanders's now famous April 1 meeting with the editorial board of the New York Daily News than that the last thing he expected to be demanded of a candidate representing so advanced a commitment to social justice was some acquaintance with facts, or specifics as to how one might go about the goal, say, of breaking up the big banks. Mr. Sanders's wife would later tell a CNN interviewer that this meeting, with its questions, was akin to ""an inquisition.""Hillary Clinton's high negatives in the polls notwithstanding, the difference between her level of knowledge, command of policy and experience compared with these two others is unlikely to be lost on Americans who have these many months witnessed the total absence of any such qualification in either her Democratic primary opponent, or the man who may well become the nominee of the Republican Party. That is just one of the reasons Mrs. Clinton would have for gratitude if Mr. Trump is in fact the nominee.There is another reason that may well be more important. After long months of rage-mongering, the politics of gloom and the images of a broken America conjured by both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton looks, by comparison, like a model of hope and shining optimism -- no small claim, given those negatives. And no small advantage, either.---Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of the Journal's editorial board.Credit: By Dorothy Rabinowitz",7/5/16
Election 2016: Kasich Leaves the Path Clear for Trump --- Ohio governor ends campaign a day after Cruz; Clinton takes aim at Trump in ads,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786757408?accountid=12768,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich ended his quixotic presidential campaign Wednesday, and a relatively small, first wave of Republicans who had long steered clear of presumptive nominee Donald Trump began lining up behind him.""As I suspend my campaign today, I have renewed faith, deeper faith that the Lord will show me the way forward and fulfill the purpose of my life,"" Mr. Kasich told supporters gathered at a barn here.His announcement came a day after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz also suspended his presidential bid. The departures of Mr. Trump's last two Republican rivals followed the New Yorker's commanding victory in Indiana'sprimary, taking all 57 of the state's delegates on Tuesday.The likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, released a series of Web videos Wednesday castigating Mr. Trump, one of which used the words of his Republican rivals.Although her focus was on the general election, Mrs. Clinton still is facing feisty opposition from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has vowed to soldier on until the final Democratic contests on June 7 even though he has scant chance of winning the nomination.Nervousness about Mr. Trump within the GOP was symbolized by the party's senators who face tough re-election battles this November.New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte's campaign said Wednesday she will ""support"" Mr. Trump but ""isn't planning to endorse him."" Ms. Ayotte, who faces a competitive re-election fight against Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, didn't elaborate on the difference between supporting and endorsing Mr. Trump. A spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, who had been Mr. Kasich's highest-profile surrogate and faces re-election in November, also announced he will back Mr. Trump, though his top aide didn't say Mr. Trump's name.""As Rob has been saying for the past year, he intends to support the Republican nominee,"" Portman campaign manager Corry Bliss said.Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, who also is up for re-election in November, was more explicit. On Twitter, he said: ""I look forward to working with Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket and maintaining a #GOP Senate.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he will back Mr. Trump. ""I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, and Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, is now on the verge of clinching that nomination,"" Mr. McConnell said.Mr. Trump also received endorsements from Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant and Rep. Candice Miller of Michigan, who isn't seeking re-election. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who in the Republicans' State of the Union response in January delivered a stinging attack on Mr. Trump's harsh stance toward immigrants and other policies, said she would back him as the party's nominee.Speaking to reporters in Las Vegas, Republican Nevada Sen. Dean Heller said he wouldn't commit to vote for Mr. Trump, but said he would be ""against Hillary Clinton."" Mr. Heller, who isn't facing re-election this year, reminded reporters that Nevada has a ""none of the above"" option on its ballots and said he is considering voting that way.A spokesman for former President George H.W. Bush said he is retired from politics and a spokesman for his son, former President George W. Bush, said he ""does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign.""Mr. Kasich was to appear at a Wednesday morning event in Sterling, Va., but decided to stay in Columbus after learning that people who hadplanned to attend a series of Washington-area fundraising events were beginning to cancel.Hours later, he announced the end of his campaign in a barn on the sprawling grounds of Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in an upscale Columbus neighborhood. There, his 16-minute withdrawal speech was delivered to a handful of supporters and a crowd consisting largely of journalists.Choking back tears, Mr. Kasich offered a paean to his overarching message of running a positive campaign and his accomplishments in 5 1/2 years as Ohio governor. As he did on the campaign trail for months, he lamented that his way didn't attract television viewers or broader public support. ""You see, some miss this message -- it wasn't sexy. It wasn't a great sound bite,"" he said.Aside from his second-place finish in New Hampshire and a victory in his home state, Mr. Kasich's campaign failed to gain traction in the 39 other states that have cast ballots in the 2016 GOP race. Determined to run what he called ""a positive campaign,"" Mr. Kasich refused to launch personal attacks against Mr. Trump or any of his other opponents.That refusal to engage with Mr. Trump led to speculation in recent weeks that he could be a potential running mate for the New Yorker, a prospect Mr. Kasich has ruled out on several occasions. Mr. Trump told CNN he might vet Mr. Kasich as a vice-presidential option. In a separate New York Times interview, he said Mr. Kasich wasn't on his short list ""at this moment.""Credit: By Reid J.

"Trump's Biggest Trophy Yet: the Republican Party --- New York businessman, who started planning in 2012, outmaneuvered GOP leaders and rivals",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786757269?accountid=12768,"Back when few people took Donald Trump seriously as a potential presidential candidate, the New York businessman asked former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his wife, Callista, to meet in Iowa. Over breakfast at the Des Moines Marriott Hotel in January 2015, Mr. Trump spent 45 minutes grilling Mr. Gingrich on his experience running for president.""It was clear to me at the end of the talk that he was seriously considering it,"" Mr. Gingrich said.Yet two months later, in March 2015, three-quarters of Republican primary voters in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said they couldn't imagine supporting Mr. Trump for president. He was so marginal that during a candidate cattle call by the National Rifle Association the following month more people stayed to listen to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal than to Mr. Trump.Most Republican leaders remained oblivious while Mr. Trump plotted the political equivalent of a corporate takeover. With his resounding victory Tuesday in Indiana, he has seized a controlling stake in the Republican Party with the backing of shareholders unhappy with previous management.Mr. Trump, having driven out the last of his rivals, is now the party's presumptive nominee -- a jaw-dropping outcome that says as much about the GOP, caught in turmoil and transition, as it does about Mr. Trump.Ever since their bitter 2012 presidential loss, Republican leaders and the party's grass roots have been at odds, with rank-and-file voters angry at the failure of elites to deliver, and at odds over the issue of immigration. Mr. Trump found opportunity in the rupture.Party leaders and the other GOP candidates almost unanimously underestimated Mr. Trump's staying power. His rivals believed his provocative campaign would fail, a presumption that allowed him to run for months in a splintered field of competitors. Most were reluctant to attack, convinced they would scoop up his supporters when Mr. Trump's campaign finally imploded.Republicans proved vulnerable to his unconventional campaign style. As a skilled entertainment professional, he made himself ubiquitous. His audience seemed ready to forgive any outrageous comment or slip-up.Mr. Trump dominated the campaign conversation with a communications-heavy strategy that relied on mass rallies, TV interviews and debates. That meant no polling, no analytics, little paid media, no consultants.""This election isn't about the Republican Party, it's about me,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview this week. ""I'm very proud I proved an outsider can win by massive victories from the people, not from party elites or state delegates.""Having dealt the GOP establishment its biggest defeat in decades, Mr. Trump said his mission wasn't to change the party. He also doesn't appear interested in whether the GOP can muster the kind of institutional support its presidential nominee normally receives.""I'd rather have a unified Republican party, but I'm not sure that's as necessary to the voters, to see people getting along,"" he said. ""They are voting for a person, not a party.""A year ago, few regarded Mr. Trump as a serious candidate. Coverage of his candidacy for a while appeared in the entertainment section of the Huffington Post, a liberal website.In the months before Mr. Trump declared his candidacy, many dismissed his pre-campaign maneuvering as a bid for attention, in part because of his past flirtations.In fact, Mr. Trump said he kicked himself for not running in 2012, and on New Year's Day 2015, he recalled telling a friend, ""If the country keeps going in this horrendous direction, I have to run.""The moment had its roots in the 2012 defeat of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a defeat that sent the party into a tailspin.The Republican National Committee, in an autopsy of its failings that year, concluded the party needed to do more to reach out to Latino voters and moderate its position on immigration policy.Party leaders also ripped up the primary calendar and changed rules to avoid the long, bitter primary season they believe hobbled Mr. Romney.What followed were years of mounting hostility among conservatives on talk radio, the Internet and in grass-roots networks. Leaving behind a long-standing ideological battle with liberals, they embarked on an intraparty battle with the establishment, which conservatives increasingly viewed as distant and ineffective. That fueled primary challenges such as the one that nearly toppled Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas in 2014, as well as a backbench insurgency that drove House Speaker John Boehner from office last year.""Republican candidates could not hear what Republican voters were saying,"" said Randy Evans, a Republican National Committee member from Georgia who is neutral in the presidential race. ""They just couldn't hear it.""Mr. Trump heard. He began planning his White House bid just weeks after the Romney loss.Mr. Trump trademarked his ""Make America Great Again"" slogan in November 2012. He road-tested his attacks on illegal immigration in a 2013 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference. He traveled to Iowa, home of the first contest in the nomination process, to campaign in 2014 for Republican Rep. Steve King. He asked Dave Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United, for advice on staffing and took his recommendation to hire Corey Lewandowski as his campaign manager.Mr. Trump in an interview with The Wall Street Journal this year said from the start he approached the campaign like one of his business deals, by ""thinking big"" with a national strategy and aggressively publicizing his case.A skeletal campaign staff was assembled in early 2015, and by May last year he had tentatively decided to announce his intentions. His initial goal was to land among the top four or five candidates. Most Republicans, Mr. Trump included, viewed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as the clear favorite.The Trump campaign launched in mid-June with an explosive premise: Whatever the risk to the party, he would give immediate voice to the economic fears of voters and their hostility toward people living in the U.S. illegally.At his campaign announcement, he promised an end to illegal immigration, reinforced by his incendiary assertion that Mexico sends rapists and drug dealers to the U.S.Mr. Trump's hard line on immigration was just the first of many departures from the GOP's post-2012 goals and its traditional conservative orthodoxy. He bashed international trade agreements dear to the party's business allies and free-trade gurus. He talked tough about international terrorism, but showed an anti-interventionist streak that worried the party's hawks.Through it all, Mr. Trump smashed expectations by surviving storms over remarks that would have sunk others. He questioned the war-hero status of Republican Sen. John McCain. He insulted women and his rivals in vulgar terms and was slow to disavow the endorsement of a white supremacist. Instead of hurting him, Mr. Trump's swagger seemed to swell support.During his first campaign swing through New Hampshire in mid-July, Mr. Trump was booked to speak at a VFW hall with a capacity of 200. Some 3,000 people came to see him.""People were standing on rooftops, clapping, yelling,"" as his car drove up, Mr. Trump recalled.Voter hunger for a break-the-furniture political figure became broadly apparent. In state after state, exit polls showed, a majority of GOP primary voters said they felt they had been betrayed by Republican politicians. Among those voters, Mr. Trump cleaned up.""Donald Trump may not be the answer, but he is the final wake-up call for the party of Lincoln, Reagan and the Bushes,"" said Bing Graffunder, a 70-year-old businessman from Dallas. ""The establishment better wake up.""""The way things are right now, we need a change,"" said Bernie Smith, 72, a Trump supporter from Howard, Wis. ""We need career politicians out of the White House to do something.""Mr. Trump still has work to do in winning over voters like Pat Harrison, 81, who said she attended a recent Trump rally but expressed concerns about ""some of the things he says about women."" When she cast her ballot Tuesday in the Indiana primary, she voted only for Republicans running in races other than that for the presidential nomination.Mr. Trump was the best-known Republican candidate and for a time led a crowded field with roughly a third of the vote in most states. Rivals refrained from attacking him for months, each with his own reason, giving Mr. Trump room to grow.Sen. Ted Cruz held back because he expected to inherit Trump voters when the businessman finally sank. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, an establishment favorite, gave him a pass as part of broader campaign strategy of laying low.Those who did attack Mr. Trump early on -- Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- learned Mr. Trump's brutal response. He gave out Mr. Graham's cellphone number and ridiculed Mr. Paul and Mr. Perry. They were among the first to drop out. Mr. Trump called himself a ""counterpuncher,"" daring others.When Mr. Bush pushed back and tried on Trump-style schoolyard tactics, it sullied the political brand Mr. Bush had been trying to sell: the optimistic political leader. The same thing happened to Mr. Rubio just before he dropped out of the campaign. He took the bait, got down in the mud with Mr. Trump, and regretted it.Mr. Trump's rivals were unwilling to coordinate with each other to oppose him, and other Republicans were reluctant to step forward.When the leading stop-Trump vehicle, Our Principles PAC, aired a TV ad with Mr. Trump's quotations hostile to women, it drew up a list of 10 Republican women senators, governors and House members to help drive the message in TV interviews. None would participate, an official said.Anti-Trump forces spent more than $75 million on TV ads, according to data compiled by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. Most of that advertising aired long after the real-estate mogul took control of the race.In the 13 months before Iowans kicked off the voting on Feb. 1, candidates and outside groups spent $14.7 million on anti-Trump advertising, according to the Kantar data. After Iowa, that total jumped to $61 million, or roughly a quarter of all TV advertising since the Iowa caucuses.Mr. Cruz seemed to catch a wave of anti-Trump sentiment when he won the Wisconsin primary. That prompted Mr. Trump to reassess his campaign. A business friend recommended Paul Manafort to bring in operational structure and GOP contacts the Trump campaign had long criticized.Wisconsin turned out to be too little too late for anti-Trump forces. Beginning with the New York primary, Mr. Trump enjoyed a series of landslide victories.Mr. Trump's phone began ringing soon after his New York win with calls from party regulars, including a couple of former candidates, his son Donald Trump Jr. said.As he took the congratulatory calls, Mr. Trump smiled and winked at his family who had gathered at the candidate's Manhattan penthouse.""That was the moment when my father, and all of us, felt that the establishment elite began moving his way,"" Mr. Trump Jr. said.Fittingly, Mr. Cruz ended up his closest rival. He was perhaps the only other candidate who seemed to understand the need to speak directly to voter disillusionment not just with Democrats but also with the GOP hierarchy.Mr. Cruz, however, couldn't trump Mr. Trump.""The Republican base was so disgusted, so angry that they were looking for someone to kick over the table,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Cruz, as a Princeton- and Harvard-educated lawyer, could describe the table. But Trump walked in and really kicked it.""---Patrick O'Connor, Reid J.

A Trump-First Foreign Policy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784663117?accountid=12768,"As Donald Trump closes in on the Republican nomination, he's rolling out a formal lecture series to detail his agenda and burnish a more dignified brand. His maiden policy speech on Wednesday, devoted to foreign affairs, earns an ""incomplete"" at Trump University.""America First will be the major and overriding theme of my Administration,"" Mr. Trump said in Washington. He called for ""a new foreign-policy direction for our country -- one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy and chaos with peace."" The businessman didn't mention if the same principle will apply to his rallies or harum-scarum campaign.The 5,000-word speech lacked specifics by normal political standards, if not his own. The central motif, like all of Mr. Trump's political thought, is that the businessman has the brains and strength to solve a given problem, and everybody else is a pathetic loser, so trust his instincts and temperament. ""I'm the only one -- believe me, I know them all -- I'm the only one who knows how to fix it,"" he said.Mr. Trump's intuition does sometimes lead in constructive directions. He is right to identify rising world disorder as the pre-eminent threat to American security and interests. He said President Obama ""dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies,"" which is an overstatement that nonetheless captures the reality.Mr. Obama leadership-from-behind philosophy has confused allies, and many have decided that they can't depend on U.S. commitments. Adversaries like China, Russian and Iran are testing the limits of his resolve as they push for hegemony in their regions.Mr. Trump is also correct that if he rebuilds alliances he ought to expect more from U.S. partners. And he has a point about the disproportionate burden the U.S. bears to guarantee European security, even if America's forward deployments also secure U.S. security by deterring aggressive authoritarians.Yet as Mr. Trump critiqued the results of Mr. Obama's withdrawal from the world, he also assailed the international engagement that could lead to better outcomes. ""We need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam,"" he said, without saying what that plan is, though he did note that ""our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS.""But the U.S. invaded and then needlessly withdrew from Iraq, pushed regime change in Libya but then walked away, and failed to intervene in Syria. Mr. Trump's hindsight critique of the Iraq war is now a standard of his repertoire, though he sometimes seems to think Mr. Obama erred by not starting a war in Syria. ""We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing,"" he added. Well, which is it?For prepared remarks, or for that matter even an after-dinner talk, Mr. Trump's speech was especially rife with contradictions. He said the conduct of foreign policy must be ""more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything."" He also said the conduct of foreign policy must be ""disciplined, deliberate and consistent.""Mr. Trump portrayed America's posture abroad as an unbroken line of ""one foreign-policy disaster after another"" across Presidents of both parties since the end of the Cold War. By this he largely seems to mean that the U.S. has not exercised ""economic power"" or what he calls ""the leverage"" over other nations.Mr. Trump's threats of trade wars with China, Mexico and Japan may please economic nationalists, but such brinksmanship could well provoke another global recession. American interests must come first, but the trade-offs are inevitably complex. Republican and Democratic Presidents since the 1930s have concluded that trade is a net benefit to the economy. They've also defended the Pax Americana that arose after the Soviet collapse, which both Messrs. Trump and Obama hold in contempt. There's more continuity between their beliefs than either man would care to admit.Mr. Trump isn't known for close readings of his briefing books, if such documents exist, and deep policy knowledge is obviously not the source of his political appeal. But Americans typically prefer Presidents who are conversant about the world's biggest problems beyond a sound bite or two, and Hillary Clinton will aggressively litigate the businessman's Commander in Chief credentials, to put it mildly.Mr. Trump promised to ""win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become President."" He won't become the GOP nominee much less President if voters don't trust him with nuclear weapons, so a serious if contradictory speech is at least a kind of progress.",7/6/16
Trump To World: 'America First',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1784662872?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, emboldened by fresh primary wins this week and pivoting toward a likely general-election fight, called Wednesday for the U.S. to pull back from its global engagements, marking a decisive break from recent Republican orthodoxy.Mr. Trump's first major foreign-policy address outlined a series of blunt principles, some of them arguably contradictory, and was notable for its willingness to excoriate the vision of former President George W. Bush, as well as President Barack Obama.The speech came a day after Mr. Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton took all-but-irreversible control of their parties' nomination processes with sweeping primary victories in Northeastern states. Their rivals responded differently to their fading hopes on Wednesday.Mr. Trump's leading rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, took the unusual step of naming his potential running mate three months before the Republican convention, choosing former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton's rival, is laying off hundreds of field staff, the campaign said.The front-runners, in contrast, spent the day mostly focused on each other and the general election. The Clinton campaign sought to capitalize on Mr. Trump's comment in a victory speech Tuesday night that if Mrs. Clinton were a man, ""I don't think she'd get 5% of the vote."" Clinton aides sent out a fundraising message attacking his ""absurd diatribe against Hillary,"" adding that Mrs. Clinton needed donations because she had to be ""prepared"" for Mr. Trump's ""unpredictable"" message.The new landscape prompted renewed scrutiny of the front-runners' positions, especially when it comes to Mr. Trump, who would be the only major party nominee in recent memory with no government or military experience. A central aspect of his foreign-policy address, at the Mayflower Hotel a few blocks from the White House, was its solemn delivery, after months of raucous rallies and often coarse comments.Mr. Trump's overriding theme was that the U.S. must reset its relations with other countries, easing tensions when possible, showing enemies that the U.S. means business, and guarding against becoming involved in too many parts of the world. Despite differences with China and Russia, he said, ""We are not bound to be adversaries.""Striking a nationalistic tone, Mr. Trump was unambiguous in saying he would demand that allies pay the U.S. part of the bill for defending them or else they would have to defend themselves.Many of Mr. Trump's comments contrasted with recent Republican foreign policy. GOP leaders, led by such figures as Mr. Bush and Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), have often called for muscular U.S. engagement in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere.The speech was mostly devoid of new proposals, but was harsh in its criticism of Mr. Obama for what Mr. Trump called an incoherent foreign policy that favored America's enemies, disappointed its friends and relegated its security to a lower priority.""My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It has to be first. Has to be.""White House spokesman Josh Earnest defended Mr. Obama's record and said voters would have to decide for themselves who they want as the next commander in chief.Mr. Trump repeatedly said a top priority would be expanding the U.S. military, modernizing its nuclear weapons arsenal and greatly increasing the number of U.S. troops, ships and aircraft.But he stopped short of detailing what a new American military would do, or what the role of a beefed-up armed services would be, or how that plan would coexist with a vision of a greatly reduced U.S. footprint.While Mr. Trump outlined general principles like making America ""a great and reliable ally again,"" he provided little indication of how that might play out in a complex hot spot such as Syria.Advocating both aggressiveness and disengagement, Mr. Trump didn't hesitate to go after Mr. Bush, saying his 2003 decision to invade Iraq destabilized the Middle East and the ""biggest beneficiary has been Iran."" And he said Mr. Obama's actions in the Middle East gave rise to Islamic State, a terror network that he said must be defeated, though he didn't specify how.Despite the grander setting, Mr. Trump didn't retract his more controversial foreign-policy ideas, reiterating his call for a ""pause"" in allowing Muslims to enter the U.S.But he also didn't repeat several proposals that are greeted with roars at his rallies. These include the construction of a 1,000-mile wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and harsher interrogations of terror suspects.Mr. Trump tried to tether Mrs. Clinton to Mr. Obama -- her boss when she was secretary of state -- saying the two let the U.S. lose influence and allies around the world.""Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction,"" Mr. Trump said. ""The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton, we've had the exact opposite -- a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake.""The Clinton campaign was sharply critical of the speech, saying the Trump approach would make the world more chaotic and dangerous. ""I've never seen such a combination of simplistic slogans, contradictions and misstatements in one speech,"" said former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a call arranged by the Clinton campaign.Ms. Albright also criticized his use of the term ""America First,"" saying it echoed the ""America First Committee"" that urged the U.S. to stay out of World War II, despite Nazi Germany's aggression in Europe. ""Maybe he never read history, or he just doesn't understand it,"" she said.There are signs that more Republicans are warming to Mr. Trump's candidacy, or at least coming to terms with the fact that he is their likely nominee. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) said, ""Donald Trump delivered a very good foreign-policy speech in which he laid out his vision for American engagement in the world.""Credit: By Damian Paletta and Peter Nicholas",7/6/16

The Trump Reality,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786757202?accountid=12768,"With his victory in the conservative heartland of Indiana, Donald Trump is the likely Republican nominee for President. A plurality of GOP voters has rejected the strongest presidential field in memory to elevate a businessman of few fixed convictions and little policy knowledge who has the highest disapproval ratings in the history of presidential polling. Now what?---Mr. Trump wasn't our first choice, or even the 15th, but the reality is that more GOP voters preferred him to the alternatives. Dozens of miscalculations made his hostile takeover possible, not least decisions by other candidates in the early primary states to attack each other instead of Mr. Trump. Ted Cruz and his allies also prepared the ground by stoking rage against ""the establishment"" and immigrants, only to have Mr. Trump hijack their stage-managed rebellion as a more convincing restrictionist.Yet GOP voters made the ultimate decision, and that deserves some respect unless we're going to give up on democracy. The GOP electorate had its chance to reconsider Mr. Trump after his Wisconsin defeat a month ago. Instead the voters rallied behind him for seven straight wins with a majority in each state.The most hopeful way to look at this is that GOP voters see Mr. Trump as the vehicle for American revival. They are at heart nationalists who see the U.S. in retreat abroad and the economy failing to raise wages at home, and they are revolting against both. Unlike the Japanese or the French, they aren't going to accept decline without a fight.In that sense they hope Mr. Trump will be another Ronald Reagan, who can storm Washington and overturn the status quo. This may be one reason so many of Mr. Trump's voters are older Americans who recall the failures of the 1970s and the Reagan revival that followed.The problem is that Mr. Trump is no Gipper, who had spent 40 years developing a philosophy of limited government and the U.S. national interest. As his letters show, he had superb instincts about the major issues of his day and was a brilliant political strategist. Mr. Trump is a clever political tactician, but his policy and rhetorical jaunts don't lead to anything coherent we can detect beyond his desire to ""do great deals.""This might be a silver lining if he wins in November, assuming Republicans keep their House and Senate majorities. Congress would write the tax and health-care reform bills, and our guess is Mr. Trump would accept nearly anything once he got his ""wall"" at the border. An economic growth revival is more likely with President Trump than President Clinton.The New Yorker's foreign-policy instincts are far more troubling. He shares President Obama's desire to retreat from global leadership even if he couches retreat in ""America First"" clothing and a larger defense budget. He'd have to deploy far more military force than he claims to subdue Islamic State, and he is naive about the challenge to Europe posed by Vladimir Putin. His trade policies are reckless and would either be rebuffed by the world or lead to a global recession.All of this assumes Mr. Trump can win the election, which he promises he will do ""easily"" despite his unprecedented negatives. His main reason for optimism is that Hillary Clinton is almost as disliked as he is. But she will benefit from a largely unified Democratic Party, and Mr. Trump has divided Republicans while doing his best to alienate swing voters, especially ""the Hispanics,"" as he likes to say, and ""the women.""Mr. Trump may be able to improve his image if he controls his perpetual insult machine, but there is little evidence that he can or will do so. The essence of his politics is personal, and it's not obvious he knows any other way.---The upshot is that Mr. Trump would be the highest variable presidential nominee in history. He has a chance to win, but he could also alienate or frighten so many voters that he loses in a landslide and takes the GOP House and Senate majorities along for the slide. Republicans across the country will have to make their own calculations about supporting Mr. Trump, but one priority should be limiting the down-ballot damage from a Trump washout.One temptation to avoid is purging every Republican who fails to denounce the Trump candidacy. This is an election, not the Spanish civil war. There's a world of difference between a Chris Christie, who endorsed Mr. Trump when he was still stoppable, and Paul Ryan, who has a position of responsibility and will have to steer Mr. Trump in the right direction if the businessman wins -- or rebuild the GOP if Hillary Clinton wins.Note that the political left is now echoing the conservative pundits who want to brand every Republican with a scarlet ""T."" They know Mr. Trump lacks a governing philosophy. But they want to use him to undermine conservative ideas as an alternative to their vision of the redistributive state. They also hope to use Mr. Trump as a battering ram to take back Congress and destroy reform Republicanism in the states for a generation. Conservatives shouldn't abet this strategy, even as they explain to voters the difference between Ryan conservatism and the Trump caricature of it.Our own approach during the next six months will be to scrutinize Mr. Trump as we will Mrs. Clinton -- with an eye on what is in the best interest of free people and American prosperity. As unappealing as this election choice is, one of them will be the next President. We have to make the best of that reality.",7/8/16
What Donald Trump Needs Now,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1786757181?accountid=12768,"No one has seen anything like this. Donald Trump -- without past political or military experience and facing a formidable Republican field -- bludgeoned 16 opponents into submission, rewrote the rule book and became the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee.As extraordinary as this is, Mr. Trump's success was achieved only by inflicting tremendous damage to the party. To win the general election in November, he must now unify a GOP with a deeper divide than it has faced in more than half a century.Mr. Trump must disabuse himself of the notion he expressed last week that he ""can win without"" party unity. As if to prove it, Mr. Trump -- on the morning he routed Ted Cruz in Indiana -- implied that Sen. Cruz's father was involved in President John F. Kennedy's assassination. This was nuts. Winning the presidency is difficult for Republicans under normal circumstances; Mr. Trump's scorched-earth tactics have left deep wounds that make victory more uncertain.To heal his party, Mr. Trump should approach the convention gingerly. He shouldn't mess with the rules or upend the platform and must energize the GOP with his vice-presidential pick.He has promised that he would announce a list of the sort of people he would consider for Supreme Court picks. So he should do it. They would immediately be targeted by Democrats, but that would be a useful reminder to Republicans about what they stand to lose if Hillary Clinton is elected.Mr. Trump should also offer the names of those he would consider for his cabinet. This will ameliorate concerns about his temperament and team. But for heaven's sake, make certain that they are comfortable being mentioned. No more suggesting he'd appoint Carl Icahn as Treasury secretary, only to have Mr. Icahn say he wouldn't serve.For the general election, the Trump campaign is behind in everything: digital operations, the ground game, advertising, you name it. The campaign must add new people and talents but would be wise to leave the ground game to the Republican National Committee. Sign the ""joint fundraising agreements"" that RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and the GOP Senate and House campaign committees must have to collect the resources necessary for a massive voter turnout effort that is beyond the Trump campaign's abilities.Mr. Trump should also avoid attacking Mrs. Clinton in ways that hurt him and strengthen her. He is already in terrible trouble with women: In the April 14 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 69% of women rate him negatively, 58% very negatively. So stop saying things like: ""Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5% of the vote."" He was lucky her response to that jibe was so lame. Next time it won't be.Mr. Trump must also retool his stump speech. Voters will tire of The Donald if he doesn't have a second rhetorical act with far fewer insults and more substance. Reading more speeches from a teleprompter, particularly on the economy, will help. The Trumpistas argue that voters don't need details, but those up for grabs in November do. These speeches will put meat on the bones of his policy views and yield new material for the stump.These speeches should be fact-checked in advance. Now that he faces Mrs. Clinton, the press will give him fewer passes on unsubstantiated statements -- for instance, his patently false claim last week that ""ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil."" Such misstatements will further shrink the pool of voters who believe he is ""honest and straightforward,"" which is already down to 35% in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll.Mr. Trump should also get his wife and daughter to travel with him to major appearances. When they are around he is more personable and hurls fewer insults.Beginning in early June, Hillary Clinton's super PAC will launch a $90 million ad campaign attacking Mr. Trump. He must not repeat Mitt Romney's mistake of not responding. The problem for Mr. Trump is that he has ruled out using super PACs, saying last year that they are a ""total scam"" and ""we don't want any of that money.""Fine. But as a self-funder, he must then cough up the cash necessary to counter the assault. The good news is that Federal Communications Commission rules favor candidates, so Mr. Trump's campaign can buy TV at the lowest possible price, and Mrs. Clinton's super PAC can't. In other words, he can match her super PAC's throw-weight with less than half the money.Most important of all, Mr. Trump must understand that only 10% of America's eligible voters have participated in GOP primaries, and 9% in Democratic ones. The race will be decided by the other 81%. He starts the general election way behind with them, and cannot persuade them with the tactics and rhetoric that brought his moment of triumph Tuesday.Congratulations to Mr. Trump on his victory: The hard part is ahead. Buckle up.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",7/8/16
"Trump, GOP Keep Up Tense Dance",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787231335?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump set out from the beginning to assemble his own coalition of Republican voters to win the party's presidential nomination -- not join an existing conservative movement.Now, as the party's presumptive nominee, he would typically be expected to try to merge those two worlds to strengthen his position before taking on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Yet it is unclear how far he is willing to bend on a variety of issues, and he has already sent signals that he is willing to leave behind those who don't embrace his agenda.""Ideally, we're going to be together,"" Mr. Trump said last week. ""I think we're going to win even if we're not together. There are some people I honestly don't want their endorsement.""In the past two days, the tension has been obvious in House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R., Wis.) initial reluctance to embrace Mr. Trump on Thursday, and in the New Yorker's gruff response, shooting back he was ""not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda.""""Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party,"" Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post on Friday. ""Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!""Mr. Trump has made clear his views from the outset, a message that many may not have fully appreciated at the time. Months before the billionaire businessman launched his presidential campaign last year, he told a group of governors, including Chris Christie and Scott Walker, at the Palm Beach, Fla., home of industrialist David Koch, that they represented more of the same and had no shot of winning the White House, according to people present.The episode underscores an awkward truth facing Republicans as they weigh whether or how much to support their party's new standard bearer: Mr. Trump's campaign has always been more about remaking the party in his own populist mold than about observing the tenets that have governed the GOP since Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s.At the same time, Mr. Trump's supporters believe he has demonstrated an ability to reach beyond traditional conservative and GOP lines to attract independent and Democratic voters to his unorthodox and eclectic political approach.Polling suggests that Mr. Trump has substantial appeal among white independent voters, whereas Mrs. Clinton doesn't fare as well with that important swing group. Some 40% of registered voters have said in Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling this year that they would back Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton in a general election. But some 45% of white independents said they would vote for Mr. Trump in that match-up.By contrast, only 35% of white independents have said they would back Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump, a substantially smaller share than the 49% of registered voters overall, Journal/NBC News polling this year has shown.Since Mr. Trump locked up the nomination this week, a number of prominent Republicans have rallied behind him, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant and Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts.On Friday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus sought to smooth over any differences between Mr. Trump and those Republicans still wary about supporting Mr. Trump, arranging a meeting between him and Mr. Ryan on Thursday.""I honestly think he understands that building and unifying and growing the party is the only way we're going to win,"" Mr. Priebus said of Mr. Trump at a breakfast sponsored by Politico. ""I think he gets that.""Yet former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush posted on Facebook on Friday his decision not to cast a vote in the presidential race in November. ""Donald Trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character,"" Mr. Bush said. ""He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot support his candidacy.""At this point, some of the differences between Mr. Trump and longtime Republicans are stylistic. More traditional politicians have bristled at Mr. Trump's outspoken remarks about women, Mexican immigrants and Muslims, among other demographic groups, as well as his pugnacious persona. That rhetoric, though, could have big ramifications in the election, as Democrats have won the last two presidential races by winning all of those voting blocs.Mr. Trump also represents a potentially dramatic departure from Republican Party orthodoxy on a range of foreign and domestic policies, favoring a more restrained approach on the world stage and opposing Republican-led efforts to seal new trade agreements and overhaul the longstanding entitlement programs that help support the poor and elderly.On the foreign-policy front, Mr. Trump has made a point of blaming former President George W. Bush for the turmoil in the Middle East and noted that the World Trade Center fell during the last Republican president's tenure in the White House.On the domestic front, he has questioned Republicans' call to change Medicare and Social Security, a top priority of Mr. Ryan and other conservatives. At the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2013, he even suggested those positions could cost the party elections, because Democrats could appeal to the many Americans who benefit from the programs.Social conservatives, many of whom backed former rival Sen. Ted Cruz, are especially wary of Mr. Trump serving as their chief advocate in the fight against abortion rights and gay marriage after he has taken mixed or lukewarm positions on those issues.Immigration, his signature issue, is an area where the two sides are considerably closer, though some Republicans have warned of the costs and logistical difficulties in building a wall on the southern border and exporting illegal immigrants already in the country.GOP primary voters split, 42%-42%, between those who view Mr. Trump positively and those who view him negatively, according to an April Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Just 61% said they could see supporting him.The resistance to Mr. Trump has been particularly pronounced among elected Republicans. On Friday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham became the latest high-profile Republican to vow not to support Mr. Trump in November.""I do not believe he is a reliable Republican conservative nor has be displayed the judgment and temperament to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Mr. Graham said, adding that he doesn't plan to attend the party convention this July. Mr. Trump's response: ""While I will unify the party, Lindsey Graham has shown himself to be beyond rehabilitation,"" he said. ""And like the voters who rejected him, so will I!""Enlarge this image.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",7/11/16
Election 2016 -- Analysis: Is Fed the Key to Trump Debt Plans?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787231333?accountid=12768,"If there's one part of being president for which Donald Trump feels uniquely suited, it's handling the national debt. Since several of his companies have gone through bankruptcy, he has ample experience negotiating with creditors.""I am the king of debt,"" he said on CNBC on Thursday. ""I love debt. I love playing with it.""But would he actually bring those skills to bear as president and force holders of $19 trillion of U.S. Treasury debt to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar, as his comments in that interview at implied? Almost certainly not.That debt is the lubricant of the global financial system, so default would cause a financial panic of epic proportions. Moreover, as Mr. Trump seems to realize, the U.S. is not like a hotel. It can borrow as much as it likes.But there's another way he might try to save money on the debt: by making it a consideration for the Federal Reserve as it sets interest rates. It's not unprecedented; but the practice would impinge on Fed independence in a way not seen since the 1960s.Mr. Trump's policy pronouncements aren't known for their consistency. He first said during a debate last fall that his experience in bankruptcy qualified him for dealing with the debt. Then earlier this year he said he'd repay that debt in eight years. On CNBC on Thursday, he once again boasted how ""I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.""When pressed, though, he said a country is different and he didn't mean to renegotiate the U.S. debt, only to ""refinance"" existing debt or repurchase it at a discount, ""depending on where interest rates are."" Of course, refinancing debt saves money only when rates go down, which raises the question of what the Fed should do with rates.Mr. Trump wants rates to remain low to prevent the dollar from appreciating, which would bring ""major problems."" He added the caveat, though, that if ""inflation starts coming in . . . you have to go up and you have to slow things down.""But another consideration, he noted, was the national debt: ""What do we do with all of the money that we owe everybody when rates go up and now all of a sudden we have to borrow at two points more? One point more, even, is devastating. It has to be handled very, very carefully.""For the Fed to base interest rate decisions on the national debt would blur the lines between monetary and fiscal policy. It's heresy by today's standards, but not unprecedented. From the 1940s through the 1960s, the Fed routinely adjusted its actions to help the Treasury, eventually allowing inflation to take off.Mr. Trump made it clear he wants a Fed chairman to share his politics. Last year he accused Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen (incorrectly) of doing President Obama's bidding. He was more diplomatic Thursday, calling her ""very capable,"" but she is ""not a Republican. When her time is up, I would most likely replace her.""It may seem discordant to worry about inflation when today it's too low and serious people think central banks should finance government deficits via ""helicopter drops"" of money. Nor is it a given that any appointee by Mr. Trump would put inflation at risk to help out his administration.That said, as Mr. Trump's positions on trade and immigration demonstrate, much economic orthodoxy has been washed away in this year's political riptide. It's not hard to imagine that the autonomy of the Fed could be, as well.Credit: By Greg Ip",7/11/16

A minority of its primary voters have torched its founders' legacy by voting for a man who combines old-school Democratic ideology, a bizarre form of hyper-violent isolationism, fringe conspiracy theories, and serial lies with an enthusiastic flock of online racists to create perhaps the most toxic electoral coalition since George Wallace.""The misgivings came from conservatives active on national security as well as domestic policies. Eliot A. Cohen, a leading figure in the neoconservative foreign-policy movement and a veteran of both Bush administrations, wrote in the Washington Post thatit's time to form a third party.Leon H. Wolf, writing on the conservative site Redstate.com, declared that Republicans ""must know that there is absolutely no chance that we will win the White House"" and are likely to lose control of the Senate as well. As a result, he urged Republicans in the Senate to move promptly to confirm Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, on the theory that more liberal nominees would follow if he isn't approved now.Other conservatives, of course, have gotten on board the Trump bandwagon. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, for example, is the most important member of Congress to endorse Mr. Trump, and he has impeccable conservative credentials. His lifetime legislative ranking from the American Conservative Union is 94%.Still, there's no doubt that conservative doubts run high. As recently as last month, just 24% of self-identified very conservative Republican voters in the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said Mr. Trump was their first choice in the presidential sweepstakes. (By this month, as the options dwindled, that had risen to 40%.)A combination of factors are at work to produce this anguish on the right. On some specific issues, Mr. Trump has broken with standard conservative views. His hard-line views on immigration run counter to the more libertarian view held by many conservatives, as does his opposition to free-trade agreements.More broadly, there is a feeling among many conservatives that Mr. Trump doesn't hold strongly to principles, as they do, but rather is open to negotiating on all fronts. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Mr. Trump had ""work to do"" to unify the party and demonstrate his commitment to conservative principles.That's a feeling that will be enhanced by Mr. Trump's remarks in an interview with CNBC this week in which he said he is flexible on his plan calling for big, across-the-board tax cuts. ""When you put out a tax plan, you are going to start negotiating,"" Mr. Trump said.There also is fear on the right that Mr. Trump actually is a fan in some instances of aggressive government and presidential powers, which conservatives generally fear. His call for expelling illegal immigrants, for example, would require a big federal police force, and his declaration that companies who move factories abroad would face ""consequences"" suggests he might seek to take executive action against private firms.Social conservatives also suspect the thrice-married Mr. Trump, who has in the past supported gay rights and abortion rights, isn't really one of them. And conservative hawks are leery of his suggestions that the U.S. should pull back from alliance commitments abroad.The question now is whether Mr. Trump can allay some of those concerns, or whether conservatives find another choice in the fall.Credit: By Gerald F.

The Ryan-Trump Divide,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787231323?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump reacted with pique to Paul Ryan's statement Thursday that he isn't ready to endorse the presumptive GOP nominee for President though he hopes to be able to someday. But if he were wise the New Yorker would understand this is an opportunity. The Speaker is looking out for his House majority and his party's reform principles, and Mr. Trump needs both more than he thinks.The ""bulk of the burden on unifying the party"" will have to come from Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan said in a Thursday interview. ""I think what a lot of Republicans want to see is that we have a standard-bearer that bears our standards.""The businessman replied in a statement that ""I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda."" Mr. Trump's aides were less subtle, telling political reporters that Mr. Ryan is unfit for the Speakership. Mr. Trump's media proxies like Newt Gingrich explained GOP resistance to Mr. Trump as little more than ""a state of psychological hysteria"" among ""pseudo-intellectual right-wingers."" Mr. Gingrich has always been an expert on that score.The truth is that Mr. Ryan is a conviction politician who ran for Congress to reform government and pass policies that help the economy grow to lift incomes for all. Political parties are institutions that exist to advance principles, and some people join them for reasons other than power and ego.For Mr. Trump -- and Mr. Gingrich when he was Speaker -- politics is a series of transactions with winners and losers. The substance matters less than the art of the deal and appearing to come out on top. The policies matter less than ""winning.""And sure enough, within 48 hours of becoming the presumptive nominee, Mr. Trump reversed himself on the minimum wage and self-financing his campaign. He also suggested he was ""not necessarily a huge fan"" of some of the details in his own tax plan, which he told us in November he had written himself.Mr. Trump and his mouthpieces say other Republicans need to understand the reality of his primary victories, which is true enough. But the businessman also needs to understand the reality that other elected Republicans aren't going to abandon their principles simply because Mr. Trump won a plurality of voters in the most divisive primary election in memory. Mr. Ryan needs a Republican President to pass the reform agenda that he and his House colleagues are formulating, but Mr. Trump also needs the support of Ryan Republicans to win the White House and succeed in office if he wins.Some in the Trump entourage think he doesn't need support from Republicans in Congress and would be better off running against them. They're dreaming. The last four GOP nominees won more than 90% of the Republican vote, and that will be crucial again in this era of straight-ticket voting. If Mr. Trump sheds only a few percentage points he'll lose in a rout, and some Republicans will stay home or support someone else if they don't trust that as President he'll work with a conservative Congress.Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan are never going to commune on trade or immigration, but the candidate could broker some good will if he acknowledged that the entitlement state is unsustainable and needs reform. Mr. Ryan didn't take the risk of reforming Medicare because he thought it was easy. He did it because he knows it is necessary, and the point of being a politician is to do the right thing for the country.The other reality Mr. Trump must accept is the tremendous political risk to which his campaign exposes other Republicans. If he loses as badly as the current polls say he will, the Senate will likely flip to Democrats and the House majority could be endangered as well. By putting some distance between himself and Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan is giving cover to Republicans in tough districts to do the same.Mr. Trump's goal between now and the convention in Cleveland should be to behave in a way that causes fewer Republicans to feel they need to keep their distance. That means more than declaring that the GOP is now his to mold into whatever shape he desires. One reason Ronald Reagan succeeded in 1980 is that he grabbed the agenda that Jack Kemp and other Republicans were already pushing in the House. Mr. Trump would be smart to do the same.Flush with his victory this week, Mr. Trump may not realize that his fate may be determined by whether he is able to unite his party, and to look and sound more like a potential President, in the next 30 or 60 days. If he can't or won't show more expansive, accommodating leadership, then he'll lose and deserve to.",7/11/16

The Weekend Interview with Samuel L. Popkin: Trump Voters: Not So Irrational,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787231263?accountid=12768,"New York -- Shortly before the May 3 Indiana primary, a video of a Donald Trump supporter accosting Ted Cruz went viral. Surrounded by a throng of Trump fans shouting ""career politicians have killed America,"" the Texas senator tried to engage the man in a mock debate -- without much success. Mr. Cruz made several attempts to discuss Mr. Trump's record, then finally gave up and told the man that Mr. Trump ""is playing you for a chump,"" adding: ""Ask yourself . . . why the mainstream media wants Donald Trump so desperately to be the Republican nominee?"" The Trump supporter -- whose favored candidate reportedly has enjoyed $2 billion in free media coverage -- replied: ""They've backed you every chance they get.""Episodes like that, combined with Mr. Trump's romp through the Republican presidential primary season, have shaken many people's faith in the American electorate. But what if Trump voters, however uninformed, are still making a rational decision by backing him?That is the contrarian argument advanced by political scientist Samuel L. Popkin of the University of California, San Diego, who has studied public opinion and elections for half a century. A native of Superior, Wis., the 73-year-old Mr. Popkin has also served as a consultant for the presidential campaigns of George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Mr. Popkin is perhaps best known for applying the rational-choice theory of economics to voting.His seminal 1991 book ""The Reasoning Voter"" argues that voters are public investors who ""expend effort voting in the expectation of gaining future satisfaction."" They ""combine, in an economical way, learning and information from past experiences, daily life, the media, and political campaigns"" to make reasoned judgments about politicians.One of Mr. Popkin's favorite examples of how ""low-information voters"" use ""cues"" to form logical conclusions is Gerald Ford's eating an unshucked tamale, which signaled to many Latino voters that the president didn't understand their culture. History repeated as farce this week when Mr. Trump on Cinco de Mayo tweeted a photo of himself eating a taco bowl: ""The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!""Mr. Popkin, who was in New York City visiting family, sat down to talk on Wednesday afternoon, interpreting the often bizarre-seeming Republican primary season by using his political theory of low-information rational voting.Donald Trump isn't just any celebrity or businessman, Mr. Popkin says. The candidate came into the primaries already enjoying street cred with the Republican base. ""He was on Monday mornings on 'Fox & Friends' for several years. He was a keynote speaker three times at CPAC,"" says Mr. Popkin, referring to the Conservative Political Action Conference. Upon being endorsed by Mr. Trump in 2012, Mitt Romney praised his ""extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works."" Ted Cruz had little but praise for Mr. Trump for much of last year.""If you see a guy on a cooking show for a long time, you figure he knows how to cook. If you see a guy running businesses and educating people on how to run businesses, you figure he knows how to run a business,"" Mr. Popkin says. The real-estate developer's years of media appearances helped promote the Trump brand as a mark of prestige.Mr. Popkin adds that Mr. Trump increased his cachet with the Republican base five years ago by challenging the basis for President Obama's U.S. citizenship. Mr. Trump, he says, spoke to GOP voters' gut feeling that President Obama wasn't a ""real American.""Mr. Trump's smearing of other candidates may be inappropriate for someone who wants to occupy the Oval Office, but such insults are the ""kind of things someone might say in the locker room,"" Mr. Popkin says. Mr. Trump connected with voters by acting like a bro. By promising to build a wall along the Mexican border, he also showed voters he understood their fears about illegal immigration. Unlike cultural issues such as same-sex marriage -- which Mr. Cruz hit hard -- a president can actually do something about immigration.""The cultural worries"" about whether Latinos ""are going to be like us are really important,"" says Mr. Popkin. One reason he believes Mr. Trump drew more support among the less-educated was that college graduates have interacted more with people of different cultures.Yet well before Mr. Trump hit the campaign trail, conservative commentators, especially on talk radio, had already acculturated voters to vitriol and had moved right, particularly on immigration, apparently finding the approach good for ratings.Mr. Popkin cites the popular Midwest talk-radio host Steve Deace, who in 2013 vilified Sen. John McCain and belittled his grueling experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam: ""Standing for all the wrong things these past few years essentially nullified any purpose to his persevering through the Hanoi Hilton."" In February 2015, Mr. Deace tweeted: ""Is Jeb Bush running for president or America's Hispanic Fertility Czar?"" No wonder Mr. Trump's invective didn't hurt him with his supporters.In a USA Today op-ed on Thursday, Mr. Deace, a Cruz supporter, ironically blamed a ""celebrity-driven culture of low-information voters,"" a ""feckless batch of fake conservative media stars for sale"" and the conservative ""idiocracy"" for Mr. Trump's success. But by Mr. Popkin's lights, Mr. Cruz enabled his vanquisher's victory by fracturing the Republican Party and bludgeoning his colleagues in Congress -- the ""Washington cartel"" -- as corrupt and cowardly. There could have been compromises on issues like immigration before the primaries began, Mr. Popkin says. ""But anything Cruz went against hard, Rand Paul and [Marco] Rubio went against too.""Mr. Popkin says Donald Trump reminds him of the Texas billionaire Ross Perot, who ran for president in 1992 and 1996 as a third-party candidate espousing populism, protectionism and restrictionism. In Mr. Popkin's 2012 book ""The Candidate,"" he notes that ""Perot's credibility as a self-made man persuaded many voters that he knew enough about government to fix things.""""The less trust you have in the insiders, the more likely you are to turn to an outsider,"" Mr. Popkin says. ""The less you trust your doctor, the more likely you are to get a second opinion."" Mr. Trump's second opinion confirmed what voters wanted to believe: that entitlements could be fixed without cutting benefits and that slapping tariffs on China and companies that move jobs overseas could revive growth.Even though voters use logic to make inferences, Mr. Popkin underscores that ""reasoning and rational don't mean right,"" and that ""passion can overrule the fine print."" For example, ""If you love somebody enough, you'll ignore the problem they've never had a job or they're not divorced yet.""Reasonable Republicans remain as divided as ever on Mr. Trump. On Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that at this point he's ""not ready"" to support the presumptive GOP nominee, which elicited jeers at a Trump rally in West Virginia. Can Mr. Trump win over conservative skeptics?""There's no way to unify the party except to be a better candidate,"" Mr. Popkin says. ""Parties don't unify by themselves. Parties unify when people start to believe the guy's OK,"" he adds. Mr. Trump has to ""grow up"" and ""act like he knows he has to go to Congress"" to do certain things. ""I don't know if he can do it.""If it's any consolation, Mr. Popkin doesn't believe that Mr. Trump will permanently destroy the Republican Party. ""He got enough votes to take over the party for a year,"" he says. ""I think it will pass."" From time to time, parties indulge extreme candidates, which Mr. Popkins considers unhealthy because it ""makes it harder for the other side to be reasonable.""He estimates the chances of Mr. Trump's defeating Hillary Clinton at 1 in 6 -- better than Mr. Popkin would give to Mr. Cruz if he had won the nomination. ""Name a state that Cruz would win that Trump would lose,"" he says, while it's possible, if unlikely, that Mr. Trump could win states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that wouldn't have gone for Mr. Cruz.If Mr. Trump loses in November, Mr. Popkin expects that Mr. Cruz and many other Republicans will say the lesson of the election is that the GOP needs to nominate a true conservative. Will the Texas senator cast himself as the conservative hero who dared to take on Donald Trump while other Republicans cowered? Probably a rational assumption.---Ms. Finley is an editorial writer for the Journal.Credit: By Allysia Finley",7/11/16
"Declarations: Trump Was a Spark, Not the Fire",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787231246?accountid=12768,"God bless our beloved country as it again undergoes one of its quiet upheavals.Donald Trump will receive the Republican nomination for the presidency and nothing will be the same. How we do politics in America is changed and will not be going back. The usual standards and expectations have been turned on their head, and more than one establishment has been routed.A decent interval should be set aside for sheer astonishment.We face six months of what will be a historically hellacious campaign. Yes, we picked the wrong time to stop taking opioids.Before I go to larger issues I mention how everyone, especially the media, is blaming the media for Donald Trump's rise. I hate to get in the way of their self-flagellation but that's not how I see it. From the time he announced, they gave Mr. Trump unprecedented free media in long, live interviews, many by phone, some possibly from his bathtub. We'll never know. It was a great boon to him and amounted, by one estimate, to nearly $2 billion worth of airtime.But the media did not make Donald Trump's allure, his allure made for big ratings. Mr. Trump was a draw from the beginning. If anyone had wanted to listen to Jeb Bush, cable networks would have been happy to show his rallies, too.When Mr. Trump was on, ratings jumped, but it wasn't only ratings, it was something else. It was the freak show at its zenith, it was great TV -- you didn't know what he was going to say next! He didn't know! It was better than everyone else's boring, prefabricated, airless, weightless, relentless word-saying -- better than Ted Cruz, who seemed like someone who practiced sincere hand gestures in the mirror at night, better than Marco the moist robot, better than Hillary's grim and horrifying attempts to chuckle like a person who chuckles.And it was something else. TV producers were all sure he'd die on their show. They weren't for Mr. Trump. By showing him they were revealing him: Look at this fatuous dope, see through him! They knew he'd quickly enough say something unforgivable, and if he said it on their air he died on their show! They took him down with the question! It was only after a solid six months of his not dying that they came to have qualms. They now understood they were helping him. Nothing he says is unforgivable to his supporters! Or, another way to put it, his fans would forgive anything so long as he promised to be what they want him to be, a human bomb that will explode by timer under a bench in Lafayette Park and take out all the people but leave the monuments standing.In this regard today's television producers remind me of the producers of 1969 who heard one day that Spiro Agnew, the idiotic new Republican vice president, was going to make a big speech lambasting the media for its liberal bias. They knew Agnew was about to make a fool of himself. Who would believe him? So they covered that speech all over the place, hyped it like you wouldn't believe -- no one in America didn't hear about it. It made Agnew a sensation. The American people -- ""the silent majority"" -- saw it as Agnew did. ""Nattering nabobs of negativism,"" from the witty, alliterative pen of William Safire, entered the language.The producers had projected their own loathing. They found out they and America loathed different things.That's a little like what happened this year with TV and Mr. Trump.My, that wasn't much of a defense, was it?The Trump phenomenon itself would normally be big enough for any political cycle, but another story of equal size isn't being sufficiently noticed and deserves mention. The Democratic base has become more liberal -- we all know this part -- but in a way the Republican base has, too. Or rather it is certainly busy updating what conservative means. The past few months, in state after state, one thing kept jumping out at me in primary exit polls. Democrats consistently characterize themselves as more liberal than in 2008, a big liberal year. This week in Indiana, 68% of Democratic voters called themselves liberal or very liberal. In 2008 that number was 39%. That's a huge increase.In South Carolina this year, 53% of Democrats called themselves very or somewhat liberal. Eight years ago that number was 44% -- again, a significant jump. In Pennsylvania, 66% of respondents called themselves very or somewhat liberal. That number eight years ago was 50%.The dynamic is repeated in other states. The Democratic Party is going left.But look at the Republican side. However they characterize themselves, a majority of GOP voters now are supporting the candidate who has been to the left of the party's established thinking on a host of issues -- entitlement spending, trade, foreign policy. Mr. Trump's colorfully emphatic stands on immigration have been portrayed as so wackily rightist that the nonrightist nature of his other, equally consequential positions has been obscured.In my observation it is a mistake to think Mr. Trump's supporters are so thick they don't know his stands. They do.It does not show an understanding of the moment to say Donald Trump by himself has changed the Republican Party. It is closer to the mark to say the base of the party is changing and Mr. Trump's electric arrival on the scene made obvious what was already happening.For this reason among others, I do not understand the impulse of the NeverTrump people to anathematize and shun those Republicans who will not vow to oppose Mr. Trump and commit to defeating him. They have been warned that if they don't do these things they will not be allowed to help rebuild the party after Mr. Trump destroys it. Conservatives love to throw conservatives out of conservatism; it's like an ancestral tic. But great political movements should not be run like private clubs. And have the anathematizers noticed they aren't in charge anymore? That in the great antiestablishment disruption of 2016 they have been upended, too?We don't know what's coming in 2016, or what happens to the GOP if Mr. Trump wins or loses. If there is a rebuilding of the party, as opposed to an ongoing reinvention, we don't know when that will commence. If it is a rebuilding, on what grounds do the NeverTrump forces think it will be rebuilt? As a neoconservative, functionally open-borders, slash-the-entitlements party?I am not sure, whatever happens in 2016, that there will ever again be a market for that product. All this cycle I've been thinking of what Lee Atwater said when he wanted to communicate to a politician that a policy was not popular: ""The dawgs don't like the dawg food.""Centers of gravity are shifting. The new Republican Party will not be rebuilt and re-formed in McLean, it will be rebuilt or re-formed in Massapequa.Finally, can Mr. Trump win? Of course. Uphill but possible. If this year has taught us anything it is what Harrison Salisbury said he'd learned from a lifetime in journalism: ""Expect the unexpected.""(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Maybe President Obama Was the Spark for Mr. Trump"" -- WSJ May 14, 2016)Credit: By Peggy Noonan",7/11/16
"Election 2016: Some in GOP Fear Trump Impact --- Lawmakers in swing districts avoid, embrace or ignore the outspoken billionaire",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787027107?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's elevation to presumptive presidential nominee has raised fears among some Republicans that he could damage the election prospects of congressional candidates.Democrats have been working for months to link vulnerable Republicans to Mr. Trump, who has alienated many women and minority voters. But now that he has driven Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich from the contest, Democrats are pushing to make Mr. Trump an even bigger factor.So far, Republicans in swing states have chosen three paths: to steer clear of Mr. Trump, to embrace him and to say he doesn't matter in their races.""Vulnerable Republicans are going to have to assemble a coalition of Trump supporters and people who are offended by Trump in order to get re-elected,"" said Nathan Gonzales, an editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. ""It's a difficult task, but not impossible.""The Trump effect could be especially important in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 54-46 advantage and Democrats need to win four seats to retake control (five if they lose the White House, since the vice president breaks Senate ties). Many of the competitive Senate races are in states won by President Barack Obama, where voters may not be so friendly to Mr. Trump.Democrats also hope Mr. Trump's ascent makes their path easier in the House, but the GOP's sizable 246-188 majority there, as well as a pattern of gerrymandered districts, could help insulate House Republicans.Mr. Trump has been an unpredictable figure, upending expectations that he would quickly flame out, and many Democrats privately acknowledge that he isn't to be dismissed. The real-estate mogul energized unexpected groups of voters in the primaries, his supporters say, and could do so in the general election.Rep. Chris Collins (R., N.Y.), a Trump supporter, said political analysts and party leaders who misjudged Mr. Trump's appeal are also wrong about his down-ballot impact. ""These are the same people who said Mr. Trump had no chance,"" Mr. Collins said.Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, stressed the campaign's sheer unpredictability so far. ""We can say it makes it harder for Republicans, but we can also say that this kind of election is unprecedented,"" Ms. Duffy said. ""Nothing that we have known about politics has been true this cycle.""Some observers note that likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, like Mr. Trump, has high unfavorable ratings, saying that could blunt his impact on congressional races. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll, Mrs. Clinton was viewed negatively by 56% and positively by 32%. Still, that was eclipsed by Mr. Trump's deficit, with a negative rating of 65% and positive of 24%.Many Republicans are clearly worried that Mr. Trump could hurt their prospects.""You're putting at the top of the ticket a radioactive figure, a person of unprecedented toxicity,"" said Pete Wehner, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. ""That stuff radiates down, there's no two ways about it. The question is how you contain the damage, if at all.""Democrats have wasted little time trying to maximize that damage.In Ohio, the Senate campaign of Democrat Ted Strickland issued a statement saying, ""Here are the five words that are striking fear into Senator Rob Portman: 'presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.' "" The campaign of Mr. Portman has stressed that he was a supporter of Mr. Kasich.Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who faces a challenge from Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, didn't dispute a recording obtained this week by Politico in which he is heard telling donors that having Mr. Trump as the nominee would make this ""the race of my life,"" due to the anger Mr. Trump stokes in the Hispanic community.But Mr. McCain told reporters Thursday that while Mr. Trump adds to the ""enormous challenges"" of a turbulent election year, ""the people of Arizona, no matter what ethnic background, know me.""Other Republicans argue that Mr. Trump's presence could even help, saying he has shown an ability to bring new voters into the party, including blue-collar Democrats.""He'll win in this congressional district, and if you are down-ballot, the effect will be positive,"" said Mark Assini, a town supervisor outside Rochester, N.Y., who hopes to unseat Rep. Louise Slaughter (D., N.Y.). ""There's no question that my candidacy will be helped by Donald Trump.""Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), up for re-election in what is increasingly a swing state, tweeted, ""I look forward to working with Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket and to maintaining a GBP GOP Senate.""Following guidance from the GOP Senate campaign arm, many vulnerable Republicans are trying to localize their races, focusing on home-state topics such as opioid addiction. Still, they face potentially tough decisions about, for example, whether to appear with Mr. Trump if he campaigns in their states.Some Republicans in tough re-election fights -- including Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R., N.H.), Mark Kirk (R., Ill.) and Mr. McCain -- have said they won't attend the Republican convention in July, steering clear of Mr. Trump's official coronation.On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) are trying to forge an identity separate from Mr. Trump's, casting GOP lawmakers as fiscally responsible problem-solvers. Mr. Ryan, in particular, has worked to boost the Republican brand, and has said the House GOP will offer ideas for replacing the Affordable Care Act and overhauling the tax code before the July convention.One challenge for Republicans is that voters have resisted ticket-splitting in recent years. The share of congressional districts in which voters picked a president from one party and a House candidate from the other hasn't exceeded 20% for almost 16 years.In the last presidential election, just 5.7% of congressional districts split their tickets, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution.Charlie Cook, editor of the Cook report, this week put the odds that Republicans would keep the Senate at 40% or lower. He estimated that while the GOP would retain control of the House, they would likely lose between 10 and 15 seats.Credit: By Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson",7/11/16
Ryan Stops Short of Support For Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787026998?accountid=12768,"In the latest and most dramatic sign of the challenge Donald Trump faces in uniting the Republican Party behind his candidacy, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that he couldn't yet lend his support to the party's presumptive presidential nominee.Mr. Ryan, who will be chairman of the Republican national convention in July in Cleveland, said he hoped to come around to supporting Mr. Trump. But in the meantime he took a remarkable step by giving a high-profile voice to anxieties running through the party about Mr. Trump's conservative bona fides.""What Republicans want to see is that we have a standard bearer that bears our standards,"" Mr. Ryan said in an interview on CNN. ""I think conservatives want to know, does he share our values and our principles?""Responding in a written statement, Mr. Trump said, ""I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda."" He added, ""Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first.""The exchange illustrated the wide gulf, both in policy and personality, between the Republican Party's two most important leaders.The chasm emerged as Mr. Trump began raising fresh doubts among the party's conservatives when, in television interviews, he seemed to signal that he would favor a minimum-wage increase and wavered on his promise to sharply cut taxes.Earlier in the week, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for the party to unite around Mr. Trump, after his last two rivals quit the primary this week.On Thursday, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said Mr. Priebus was hoping to set up a meeting between Messrs. Ryan and Trump next week.But Mr. Ryan's comments were a warning sign that party unity wouldn't come quickly or easily to the New York billionaire who rode to victory on a campaign that was long on personality and short on policy specifics.Mr. Ryan's comments carry particular weight, because in the months that the GOP has been without a nominee, he has been treated as a titular head of the party. He has been trying to develop a conservative policy agenda for House Republicans to use in running for re-election.Throughout the primary campaign, the speaker has been critical of Mr. Trump's campaign style and some of the policies he has developed, but he has remained neutral on the presidential race.His comments Thursday were an abrupt departure from his repeated assertions that he would support whomever GOP voters chose as their nominee.Asked if he would back Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan told CNN: ""I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party. And I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from the presumptive nominee.""The mixed messages among Republicans are a reflection, in part, of how surprised most were to have their presumptive nominee set so quickly. Many had expected Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich to stay in the race until the last primary on June 7, but they instead dropped out in the wake of Mr. Trump's decisive victory in Indiana on Tuesday.Although Mr. Ryan said he wants to end up supporting Mr. Trump, his initial hesitation made him the highest-profile current elected official to join the list of Republicans who have declined to close ranks around Mr. Trump in the days since the field cleared.Among the party luminaries who have said they couldn't support Mr. Trump are Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Dean Heller of Nevada. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, said he wouldn't attend the GOP convention. Former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush said they wouldn't be getting involved in the 2016 campaign.Other Republican officials, including Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts and Mr. Trump's presidential rival, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, endorsed him on Thursday. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr backed Mr. Trump earlier this week.During the divisive primary season, some Republicans floated the idea of Mr. Ryan emerging as the nominee if the party had a deadlocked convention. Mr. Ryan repeatedly refused to entertain that possibility, and again rejected the idea in the CNN interview.Mr. Trump's conservative bona fides have been challenged, because in the past he has supported liberal positions on issues such as abortion rights and tax increases. In the campaign, he has opposed efforts to rein in Social Security and Medicare, which have been championed by Mr. Ryan and other conservatives as a key to curbing the federal debt.During the campaign, Mr. Trump last year put out a tax plan that called for major cuts in income, estate and business taxes. Pressed on its details by CNBC on Thursday, he suggested it was merely a starting point for a deal.""You know, when you put out a tax plan, you are going to start negotiating,"" he said. ""You don't say, 'OK, this is our tax plan, lots of luck, folks.' There will be negotiation back and forth. And I can see that going up, to be honest with you.""Mr. Trump had signaled a day earlier that he would be open to raising the minimum wage -- an idea that is anathema to the GOP's business allies and free-market purists. ""You have to have something that you can live on,"" Mr. Trump said on CNN, echoing rhetoric that many Democrats use on the issue.Credit: By Janet Hook",7/11/16
Minimum Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787026423?accountid=12768,"The Donald Trump candidacy is going to be a daily adventure, on policy as much as rhetoric. No sooner did he vanquish his last Republican rival this week than he threw over his pledge to fund his own campaign and suggested that he may change his mind and endorse an increase in the federal minimum wage.Making the media rounds after his Indiana victory, Mr. Trump was asked on CNN whether he'd be open to raising the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. ""I am open to doing something with it, because I don't like that,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Because I'm very different from most Republicans,"" adding that ""I mean, you have to have something that you can live on.""Yes, but you also need a job to earn a wage, and a wage floor can price the young and least skilled out of the job market. A national minimum is also more destructive than state or local wage floors because it doesn't account for variations in the job market and labor demand.Mr. Trump understood the jobs point when he was competing with other Republicans who opposed raising the national minimum. ""We have to leave it the way it is,"" he said in November. ""People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum"" and ""we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it."" He repeated the point more than once during the primaries.But now Mr. Trump knows he'll be competing with Hillary Clinton, who like most Democrats favors raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Mrs. Clinton says she would sign a $15 national minimum-wage bill as long as it had some accommodation for lower-wage markets. Mr. Trump's wage wavering may be the first of many such changes given that his economic views are more visceral and populist than rooted in any free-market conviction.On Wednesday the supposed non-politician also abandoned a signature message of his primary campaign -- that Mr. Trump is the candidate who can't be bought because he is self-funding. Mr. Trump said Goldman Sachs had ""total control"" over Mrs. Clinton and called his GOP rivals ""puppets"" of big donors.Now comes news that the presumed GOP nominee is going to raise funds from donors like any other political puppet. And who better to lead this effort than a Goldman Sachs alum and longtime Clinton donor? Dune Capital CEO Steven Mnuchin is the new national finance chairman of the Trump campaign, and as far as we can tell he hasn't donated to Hillary's 2016 campaign, at least not yet. But the hedge-fund operator is in no danger of being called an outsider and will presumably hunt up contributions from big-money donors.The Journal reports that a Super Pac is also planning to raise big bucks to support Mr. Trump. Great America's co-chairman will be longtime political operative Ed Rollins, whom Mr. Trump has praised as ""tremendous."" You can bet its donors won't be paupers.Mr. Trump now needs the cash because it isn't clear he's going to spend enough of his own money to be competitive in November. His campaign-on-the-cheap made a nice talking point for voters who chose to believe, but now he has to build a national organization -- and fast. Could it be that the alleged billionaire isn't as liquid as he likes to suggest?On Thursday House Speaker Paul Ryan said he wasn't ready to endorse Mr. Trump, who replied that he wasn't ready to endorse Mr. Ryan's agenda. That isn't an auspicious start for Mr. Trump's GOP unity campaign, and his precipitous flip-flops will make the job harder. There's an old line about the hapless janitor who has to clean up after the elephant parade. For the next six months the elephant -- the GOP -- may be cleaning up after its presidential nominee.",7/11/16
Protesters for Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785699307?accountid=12768,"It's counterintuitive, but we're beginning to wonder if all of those protesters showing up at Donald Trump rallies aren't secret supporters. They couldn't possibly be doing more to persuade millions of Republicans to vote for him, if only to defend the right to free speech and association.The protests are picking up in volume and disruption as the candidates campaign in California ahead of the June 7 primary. Protesters blocked traffic, punched vehicles and cursed Trump supporters in Costa Mesa Thursday, and hundreds blocked the entrance to the GOP convention in Burlingame on Friday. About two dozen people tried to rush barriers near the Hyatt Regency, and Mr. Trump and his aides had to get out of their cars and walk into the convention.""I think it's going to get worse if he gets the nomination and is the front-runner. I think it's going to escalate,"" Luis Serrano, an organizer with California Immigration Youth Justice Alliance, told the Los Angeles Times. ""We're going to keep showing up and standing against the actions and the hate Donald Trump is creating.""Even Americans who don't support Mr. Trump may hear this and wonder who is really creating hate. The spectacles are made-for-ratings cable TV fodder, and Mr. Trump knows it. Every protester who breaks the law or waves a Mexican flag as a political statement in favor of illegal immigration might as well be voting for Mr. Trump.",7/11/16
Election 2016: Indiana Poll Bears Good News for Trump --- The GOP front-runner could cement his position in a state that Cruz has long sought,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785699242?accountid=12768,"The home stretch of the long 2016 GOP presidential race is coming into view, and the path to victory is opening wider for front-runner Donald Trump amid signs that he could pick up a big win in Tuesday's Indiana primary.A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds Mr. Trump ahead by 15 points among likely Republican primary voters in Indiana, pointing to a victory that would significantly boost the businessman's chances of clinching the Republican presidential nomination before the party's convention in Cleveland.Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, his chief rival, continued to voice confidence that he could keep Mr. Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the nomination either before the convention or on the first ballot. But Mr. Cruz needs Indiana's primary to be a pivot point.""The country is really depending on Indiana to choose the direction of this race,"" Mr. Cruz said on NBC, in one of five television appearances broadcast Sunday morning.Mr. Trump said a victory in Indiana would effectively end the contest. ""If we win Indiana, it's over, OK?"" he said at a rally in the state on Sunday.If Mr. Trump won all 57 of Indiana's delegates, he would have 1,012 bound delegates, leaving him 225 short of the magic number. He would then need 49.45% of the bound delegates remaining to be allocated -- the first time that figure would drop below 50% for any candidate in the race.The Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday bolstered the hopes of Trump supporters, showing that 49% of likely Republican primary voters favored Mr. Trump, compared with 34% for Mr. Cruz and 13% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.The poll also surveyed likely Democratic voters in Indiana and found Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead, 50% to 46%, over Sen. Bernie Sanders. With Mr. Sanders trailing significantly in the delegate count, the poll result suggests that the outcome in Indiana isn't likely to change the dynamic of a nomination fight.Mr. Trump has been on a winning streak since his landslide victories in the New York primary two weeks ago and in last week's five-state round of voting in the Northeast, which some dubbed the ""Acela primary"" after the Boston-Washington Amtrak train service.""After the Acela primary, there is an aura of inevitability surrounding the Trump and Clinton candidacies,"" said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion.Mr. Cruz's supporters have been hopeful about Indiana because it is a deeply conservative state with an influential community of evangelical Christians, the kind of voters who are part of the Texas senator's base. Mr. Cruz won the endorsement Friday of the state's governor, Mike Pence. But Mr. Pence also praised Mr. Trump and hasn't joined the ""stop-Trump"" chorus.John Hammond, a Republican National Committee member from Indiana who is neutral in the race, said Mr. Cruz's organization in the state is superior to that of his rivals, but that it may be no match for Mr. Trump's unconventional appeal. ""This appears to me to be a state that Trump is going to win,"" said Mr. Hammond.A candidate could sweep all 57 delegates in Indiana by winning the vote statewide and in all nine congressional districts. Even if Mr. Trump were to do that, he still would need to wait until June 7, the last day of the primary season, to secure the needed 1,237 delegates. Five states vote then, including California, with its trove of 172 delegates.That is where Mr. Cruz's sights are turned, win or lose in Indiana. He spoke to California's GOP convention Saturday and picked up the endorsement of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.The Cruz campaign has also continued to work at state conventions to ensure his supporters fill delegate slots, even if they are bound to vote for Mr. Trump on the first convention ballot.His team scored another such victory in Arizona. Mr. Trump had won the state's primary, but a state GOP convention on Saturday placed Cruz supporters in most of the state's 58 delegate slots.There was no such Cruz takeover at Delaware's state GOP convention Saturday, which approved a slate of 16 delegates. Most who spoke seemed prepared to back Mr. Trump beyond the first ballot.---Reid J. Epstein contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook",7/11/16

Some are tapping new data sources to guide decisions and spending, while others say they have resolved to keep operations flexible to prepare for sudden changes. A few corporate leaders say they are rethinking how much expert forecasting they are willing to pay for.""The so-called experts and global economists are proven as often to be wrong as right these days,"" says Scott Wine, chief executive of Polaris Industries Inc., a Medina, Minn., manufacturer of off-road vehicles and motorcycles.Following Britain's surprise decision last month to exit the European Union, Mr. Wine plans to lean heavily on his global workforce and customers for insights about local political sentiments and the investment climate.

Soon after the vote results were tallied, Aimia, which has business interests in the U.K, announced that the pound's decline would unlikely have a material effect on its business near term.Such planning requires considerable time and resources, Mr. Duchesne acknowledges.

"Trump Amplifies Stance on Tax, Debt",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787725735?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump sought Monday to clarify his views on fiscal and monetary policy, saying he was open to compromise on tax cuts but wouldn't try to alter the terms of the nation's $19 trillion in debt, which he called ""absolutely sacred.""In an interview Monday, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee moved to tamp down jitters over remarks in recent days suggesting he might push to renegotiate U.S. debt in an economic downturn.""This is the United States government,"" he said Monday. ""The bonds are absolutely sacred.""While pushing to broaden his appeal beyond the party, Mr. Trump is also trying to lock down support among Republicans fearful he may stray from conservative policy stances. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet this week with House Speaker Paul Ryan, an ardent tax cutter who has said he wants to better understand the New York businessman's positions before backing his candidacy. After Mr. Ryan's comments provoked a series of sharp exchanges between the two camps, the speaker said Monday that he would step aside as chairman of the GOP nominating convention if Mr. Trump wanted him to.On debt, Mr. Trump suggested he would be open to buying back Treasury notes if interest rates rise as a way to bring down the U.S. debt load. Bond prices fall as rates rise, which means the government theoretically could turn a profit by buying back debt for less than when it was issued.""With the United States government there are times on occasion you can buy back debt at a discount, meaning the interest rate goes up and you buy back debt at a discount,"" he said.With the government now running large annual deficits, such a buyback would require issuing new debt to purchase the old debt. Because that new debt would be issued at higher interest rates, it isn't clear that type of buyback would save money in the long run.Mr. Trump also said he supported holding down the value of the dollar in order to help American manufacturing and the economy. American presidents typically advocate for a strong dollar.On tax policy, Mr. Trump said that as president he would seek to persuade congressional Democrats to lower taxes on high-income households by trading on completely unrelated and unspecified policy issues.""There will be a give and take. They're going to want other things having nothing to do with this,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's one very big, very complex proposal.""He said he was also open to changing his tax plan unveiled last year, which proposed lowering tax rates, pushing 33 million households off the income-tax rolls and, according to an analysis, reducing federal revenue by nearly $10 trillion over the next decade.It's ""always possible to change,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I always believe in flexibility and remaining flexible.""Mr. Trump spoke after weekend TV appearances in which he said taxes on high-income households would go up, then later said they would rise only in comparison with his own tax-cutting proposal. His comments left some Republican tax experts trying to decipher what the party's 2016 standard-bearer believes on a central GOP issue.""He really does seem to be saying different things on different days to different people,"" said James Pethokoukis, a columnist and blogger at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""You can try to score, but you're only scoring one version of his reality.""Mr. Trump's approach to policy veers sharply from the tightly controlled, thoroughly vetted style common in modern presidential campaigns. At the same time, Mr. Trump seemed to be nodding toward his experience as a dealmaker, saying that campaign policy proposals are just the starting point in a negotiation.""My core beliefs are I want a major tax cut,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And I'm only being honest with people. You can't just say this is what my plan will be. You have to negotiate this with many other people.""Aides to the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, said Monday that voters should look past Mr. Trump's imprecise language and instead focus on his actual plan. The tax plan is the Republican's most specific economic policy, said Clinton policy adviser Jake Sullivan, and Democrats will hold him to it.""The only thing one can do is look at the black and white of his paper and not be fooled by his shifting comments,"" said Gene Sperling, a Clinton adviser and former White House economic policy aide.Mr. Trump's proposal calls for cutting the top tax rate on wages to 25% from 39.6% and for lowering the top rate on business income to 15%. Corporations now have a top rate of 35%, and many businesses report their profits on their owners' individual returns, taxed at 39.6%. Mr. Trump said there would be unspecified ""rules and regulations"" handled in ""a very orderly manner"" to prevent people from converting wage income into lower-taxed business income.Mr. Sperling, who called the Trump proposal ""risky"" and ""reckless,"" cited estimates from the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning group that often produces results that show tax cuts boosting growth. Theiranalysis -- after including economic growth -- shows that Mr. Trump's plan would reduce federal revenue by more than $10 trillion over a decade, expand budget deficits and give the income boosts to high-income households.Mr. Trump dismissed those studies, in part because they didn't look at something that isn't knowable -- the end result of tax negotiations.""They don't know what the final number is going to be after the negotiation, OK?"" he said. ""I'd love to say it's going to stay where it is, but it won't. It's going to be something that's negotiated. But also, we're going to bring tremendous business to the country.""---David Harrison contributed to this article.Credit: By Richard Rubin",7/13/16
Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: How Political Dysfunction Gave Rise to Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787704859?accountid=12768,"It turns out there is a consequence for political dysfunction. That consequence is Donald Trump.Which is to say that, of all the many forces behind the rise of Mr. Trump and Trumpism, one of the most important but least discussed is partisan gridlock in Washington. A lot of Trump support is rooted in the simple and utterly nonideological idea that he will get something done, even if it's hard to be sure what that something would be.Indeed, when voters in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll were asked about a series of qualities and attributes, Mr. Trump got better ratings for ""being effective and getting things done"" than any other.The sentiment also comes through in some of the more thoughtful messages a columnist receives from voters. John C. Stratakis, a lawyer in New York who describes himself as a ""conflicted"" Trump sympathizer, wrote recently: ""The party is also paying a price forfailing to deliver coherent governance when they held the presidency and both houses of Congress after George W. Bush's first election . . . . Perhaps Donald Trump will be able to herd these cats.""The rise of Mr. Trump provides, finally, an answer to one of the more perplexing questions of the last decade or so, which is whether American voters would ever mete out any punishment for the dysfunction in Washington. The much-maligned ""Republican establishment"" now is receiving it.In recent years, the opposite seemed to be the case: Officeholders and candidates who stood in the way of compromise and deal-making in Washington actually were rewarded, with praise from within their parties, and easy re-election. The officeholders who dared to seek compromise were the ones punished, with primary challengers from the ideological left or right of their own parties.Now comes Mr. Trump, promising to take ""The Art of the Deal"" to Washington. This Trump characteristic is one of the reasons Republican conservatives mistrust him: They look for firm principles, while he says, essentially, that most everything is open to negotiation.Perhaps most notably, he has said in recent days that his plan for big-across-the-board cuts in tax rates would be subject to negotiation once presented. This might seem a fairly obvious statement of how the legislative process is supposed to work, but it qualifies as radical thinking in a hyper-polarized Washington where compromise has become an epithet.Intriguingly, this perception of an ability to get things done also is a potential selling point for Mr. Trump's likely fall opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. More than a year ago, a supportive Democratic senator, asked what the succinct message of a Clinton candidacy should be, replied privately: I share many of Barack Obama's positions, but I actually know how to get them enacted.While she was in the Senate, Mrs. Clinton surprised colleagues on both sides of the aisle with her willingness to dive into the legislative trenches to find bipartisan plans. Voters seem to have a sense of that. In the most recent Journal/NBC News poll, views on the qualities of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton varied wildly in most other areas, but they got almost identical good marks from voters on ""being effective and getting things done.""Why is this attribute useful in 2016? A look at some sorry statistics chronicling Washington's dysfunction in recent years provides the context needed to explain why the political appeal of gridlock has expired.The ultimate Washington tool for grinding movement to a halt is the Senate filibuster, a tool in which endless debate can prevent action on a measure. When other senators want to put an end to a filibuster and move ahead, they file what is known as a cloture motion, which ends debate if it gets the support of 60 senators.The best way to track the use of filibusters is to look at the number of cloture motions filed to end them. Cloture motions used to be rare. In the two-year congressional term of 1969 and 1970, just seven cloture motions were filed, Senate records show. Twenty years later, the number had risen to 38.In the most recent full Senate term, for the years 2013 and 2014, a staggering 253 cloture motions were filed in efforts to end filibusters. Passage of laws isn't necessarily the best indicator of progress, because any law can be seen as good or bad depending on the point of view of the observer. Still, they are a good indicator of movement or lack thereof.Statistics maintained by GovTrack, a private tracking firm, show that the last two congressional terms, in 2011 and 2012 and 2013 and 2014, produced the fewest enacted laws in recent history.These are pictures of futility -- the kind of futility that helped fuel the rise of Donald Trump.Credit: By Gerald F.

Trump Needs Ryan More Than He Knows,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787704700?accountid=12768,"To say that Donald Trump and his crew have been heavy-handed in dealing with House Speaker Paul Ryan is putting it mildly. They're threatening to defrock him over his hesitation in endorsing Mr. Trump for president. The mogul may retaliate by calling for Mr. Ryan to step down as chairman of the Republican convention. (Mr. Ryan said Monday that he would, if asked.) Mr. Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, has declared Mr. Ryan unfit to be speaker. Sarah Palin wants to end Mr. Ryan's political career entirely and is backing his primary opponent.Mr. Trump, for all his political ingenuity, doesn't understand the situation he's in. He has captured only one of two wings of the Republican Party. He won the presidential wing by locking up the GOP nomination. But there is also what I call the congressional wing, led by Mr. Ryan. It shouldn't be taken lightly, even by a triumphant Mr. Trump.In a normal election year, this wing would readily fall in line behind the Republican nominee. But with Mr. Trump, things are different, and a bit more dicey. He not only has campaigned against the GOP and its leaders in Washington, he has advanced an agenda at odds with the party's long-standing policies. Mr. Ryan has balked at swallowing it.The two are scheduled to meet on Thursday. Before backing Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan wants some assurance that the presumptive nominee shares conservatives' ""values and principles."" Mr. Trump calls himself a conservative. But he has said he is ""not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda.""When the two meet, Mr. Trump will be in a strong position -- but not as strong as he imagines. He needs Mr. Ryan more than Mr. Ryan needs him. The speaker is the leader of a large bloc of Republicans that is assertive, influential and intellectually important. Mr. Trump would be wise to take Mr. Ryan's concerns seriously.There's a lot at stake. If Mr. Trump is dismissive of the congressional wing, it becomes more likely that a third-party conservative candidate will enter the race. Failing to find some common ground will make Mr. Trump's path to victory in November against Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, far more hazardous.The GOP's congressional wing includes more than members of Congress. It's loosely organized and exists in an orbit around Mr. Ryan. He is the architect of its agenda and is pursuing it vigorously in the House. Party elites are on his side.The business community, in the absence of a Republican president or sympathetic Democrats, has allied itself with GOP senators, House members, and their staffs for protection and aid during this administration. Alienated by President Obama, it had nowhere else to turn.Meanwhile, conservative think tanks have become significant players. They are the chief source of policy advice and legislative initiatives for Republicans on Capitol Hill. Their ties to Mr. Ryan are deep-seated. They have influence in the mainstream media, both print and TV.The conservative ""movement"" is divided on Mr. Trump. But many of its leaders are either aligned against him or at least unwilling to say anything nice about him. They know Mr. Ryan well and respect him. The speaker, by the way, considers himself a ""movement"" conservative.Mr. Trump may feel he doesn't have to concede anything to Mr. Ryan. The presidential wing outweighs Mr. Ryan's wing at the moment. And Mr. Trump's position is buttressed by his having received more than 10 million votes in the primaries and caucuses.The division on policy between Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan is wide, especially on trade and immigration, Mr. Trump's central campaign stands. He won't yield on either of them. Besides, Republicans have become more Trump-like on both issues. Mr. Ryan has taken immigration reform off the table for now in the House, and trade is on hold as the Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty lacks the votes to pass.Mr. Ryan's top issues are entitlement reform and tax reform. He has spent years pushing to modernize Medicare and Social Security to curb spending and reduce the national debt. He favors tax reform that kills special-interest carveouts, broadens the base and cuts individual and corporate rates. Mr. Trump opposes tinkering with entitlements and railed against tax reform in his 1997 book, ""The Art of the Comeback."" Nonetheless, compromising on these issues might assuage the congressional wing.Having never navigated a Republican convention, Mr. Trump may not understand the peril that comes with a platform fight, though his adviser Paul Manafort surely does. An effort to put controversial positions like mass deportation of illegal immigrants and high tariffs on exports from China in the platform would be asking for trouble.The congressional wing isn't likely to cave regarding what goes into the platform -- and the wing may have a majority at the convention with the votes of dozens of ""Trojan horse"" delegates pledged to Mr. Trump but conservative on most issues. Mr. Trump could wind up embarrassed by the very convention that nominates him.An overriding task for Mr. Trump is to have a successful convention with the entire country watching. ""There has to be a good feeling at the end when Trump gives his acceptance speech,"" says Republican consultant Jeffrey Bell. For that to happen, Mr. Bell says, ""Republicans and Mr. Trump must look like their party is united.""On ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, Mr. Trump said the GOP ""would be better if it were unified,"" but ""I don't think it actually has to be unified in the traditional sense."" Oh, yes it does. And he would put the possibility of achieving that unity at risk if he drifts to the political center. Unity can't be achieved unless he pulls conservatives into his camp. They are the missing piece. The key to winning them over is Mr. Ryan. Without him, unity behind Mr. Trump is impossible.Months ago, Mr. Trump said Mr. Ryan would ""pay a big price"" if the speaker declined to endorse him. That was during the primaries, when Mr. Trump didn't need Mr. Ryan. Now he does -- or he'll be the one who pays the big price.---Mr. Barnes, executive editor of the Weekly Standard, is a Fox News commentator.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: The Trump-Ryan Summit: Who Needs Whom?"" -- WSJE May. 18, 2016)Credit: By Fred Barnes",7/13/16
"I'm Voting Trump, Warts and All",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787448227?accountid=12768,"Some of my fellow Republicans have declared they will never, under any circumstances, vote for Donald Trump. They are pessimistic about the party's chances in November and seem more motivated by long-term considerations. They think devotion to the ""anybody but Trump"" movement is a principled and courageous stance that will help preserve a remnant of the conservative movement and its credibility, which can then serve as a foundation for renewal.I sympathize with this perspective, but I am planning to vote for Donald Trump. Why? Because the stakes for my country, not merely my party, are simply too high.I was one of the earliest and loudest critics of Mr. Trump. I mocked his appearance, demeanor, ideology and ego in the strongest language I have ever used to publicly criticize anyone in politics. I worked harder than most, with little apparent effect, to stop his ascendancy. I have not experienced a sudden epiphany and am not here to detail an evolution in my perspective.I believe this presidential election cycle favors Republicans, due more to President Obama's shortcomings than to any of our virtues or cleverness. I also believe that Donald Trump will have the hardest time of any of the Republican candidates in winning. He has stubbornly stuck to the same outlandish behavior and tactics that have served him so well to date. Mr. Trump continues to have the last laugh at the expense of his critics and competitors, myself included.I think electing Donald Trump would be the second-worst thing we could do this November, better only than electing Hillary Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration's radical policies. I am not pretending that Mr. Trump has suddenly become a conservative champion or even a reliable Republican: He is completely unpredictable. The problem is that Hillary is predictably liberal.There will be none of her husband's triangulation. Republicans are fooling themselves if they think this President Clinton would sign into law policies like Nafta, the crime bill, welfare reform, or the deficit reduction packages that marked Bill's tenure. While Bill felt compelled to confront Sister Souljah -- and less directly Jesse Jackson -- to appeal to moderate voters, Hillary is more responsive to pressure from Black Lives Matter and the far left. I have no idea what Mr. Trump might do, while Mrs. Clinton is predictable. Both are scary, the former less so.The next president will make a critical appointment to the Supreme Court, who will cast the tiebreaking vote in important cases that will set precedents for years to come. Issues like the sanctity of innocent human life, constitutional protections for religious liberty and Second Amendment rights, and limits on the unelected federal bureaucracy hang in the balance.In my lifetime, no Democrat in the White House has ever appointed a Supreme Court justice who surprised the nation by becoming more conservative, while the opposite certainly cannot be said for Republican appointments. Mr. Trump might not support a constitutionalist conservative focused on original intent and limits on the court's powers. He may be more likely to appoint Judge Judy. However, there is only a chance that a President Trump would nominate a bad justice, while Mrs. Clinton certainly would.The current president has abused his executive powers to implement ObamaCare and to grant de facto amnesty for illegal immigrants, in defiance of Congress and the courts. The next president will make critical decisions on whether to renew these executive orders or issue new ones repealing past abuses, and will make key appointments who will decide whether to continue bending the law to prop up ObamaCare.Repealing and replacing ObamaCare will require congressional action. But President Obama has proven how much can be done by a determined executive. I admire his tenacity, though not his goals or disregard for constitutional limits. Mr. Trump has had a decidedly mixed record of both supporting and opposing more government involvement in health care. Mrs. Clinton has been much more consistent in favor of a big-government approach, dating to her own failed efforts in the 1990s.If elected, Mrs. Clinton will continue hindering affordable domestic energy, increasing dependence on government and the growth of welfare programs, growing the nation's debt and weakening America abroad. She will more firmly establish a culture of victimhood and identity politics, further dividing Americans rather than uniting us, and will continue promoting redistribution and government interference rather than growth and freedom.I do not pretend Donald Trump is the Reaganesque leader we so desperately need, but he is certainly the better of two bad choices. Hardly an inspiring slogan, I know. It would be better to vote for a candidate rather than simply against one. If current trends hold, I will be among the many complaining this fall about my choices.I understand why so many of my Republican friends are in denial, while many of my Democratic friends gleefully anticipate and applaud defections. The media is poised to reward those ""courageous"" Republicans ready to do the ""right thing"" and endorse Hillary. Count me out.---Mr. Jindal is a former governor of Louisiana (2008-16), a former U.S. congressman (2005-08) and a former chairman of the Republican Governors Association.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: The Rise of the 'Warts and All' Republicans"" -- WSJ May. 16, 2016)Credit: By Bobby Jindal",7/13/16
Election 2016: Trump Inspires Some GOP Candidates --- Being likened to the presidential front- runner is a badge of honor for contenders,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787448197?accountid=12768,"ESSEX, Md. -- The state's largest newspaper condemned congressional candidate Pat McDonough about his views on immigration and race in an editorial that dubbed him ""The Trump of Baltimore County.""Some candidates would have flinched at the label. Mr. McDonough flagged it in a fundraising appeal. ""I wear it as a badge of honor,"" wrote the Republican state assemblyman who is challenging a Democratic incumbent. ""Just like you and Donald Trump, I am tired of seeing America lose!""""Some Republicans are worried, now that Mr. Trump has all but clinched the GOP nomination, that his inflammatory rhetoric about Muslims, immigrants and women will tarnish the entire GOP ticket in the general election.But a smaller and less-noticed pack of GOP candidates has fully embraced Mr. Trump, inspired by his blunt talk and nationalist message. Some were dismissed as fringe candidates in past elections because of their anti-immigrant platforms, but they now see the GOP standard-bearer offering political cover.""I've been talking about these issues for years,"" said the 72-year-old Mr. McDonough, who argues that illegal immigrants increase crime rates and take away jobs from Americans. ""Finally, Trump and the entire country have caught up to me.""""This is the man I've been looking for,"" Georgia GOP congressional candidate Eugene Yu recalls saying when Mr. Trump announced his White House bid nearly 11 months ago. ""Everything he says, I've been saying all along.""An immigrant from South Korea, Mr. Yu supports Mr. Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He said he came to this country legally as a teenager, and on his campaign website he writes, ""If you are here illegally YOU NEED TO LEAVE!""The retired business owner from Augusta, who ran for the same congressional seat in 2014, also backs Mr. Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., saying it is a matter of common sense. ""The Christians don't terrorize the people,"" he said. ""It happens to be the Muslims.""Todd Rehm, a Republican strategist from Georgia, said down-ballot contenders often try to emulate the messaging and strategy they see at the top of the ticket. But much of what has been effective for the former reality TV star likely wouldn't translate on a smaller stage, he said.Virginia businessman Jim McKelvey is making his second Republican bid for Congress -- this time while promoting himself as a leader of Mr. Trump's winning primary campaign in the state. He advocates sealing the border entirely until the immigration system is overhauled. ""I'm a contractor. Put me on that border and I'll put up a wall on schedule and under budget,"" said Mr. McKelvey, who will face off against three rivals for the GOP nomination at a May 14 party convention.In Florida, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Carlos Beruff, who is running in a crowded GOP field for the seat now held by former presidential candidate Marco Rubio, is drawing comparisons to Mr. Trump after saying last month in response to a question about Muslim immigrants that he would ban immigration from all Middle Eastern countries, except for Israel.""Florida's very own Cuban-American version of the Donald,"" wrote one local newspaper of the real-estate developer who, like Mr. Trump, has never held public office.Republican consultant Curt Anderson, who is advising Mr. Beruff, said the candidate is reflecting popular opinion on immigration and that his Trump-like position will help his campaign. But Mr. Anderson is cautioning all the candidates he works with not to try to imitate the businessman. ""There's only one,"" he said.Other Republicans, whether they agree with Mr. Trump or not, are finding Democrats eager to link the presumptive nominee to their campaigns. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has branded the GOP the ""Party of Trump.""""It's Donald Trump's party,"" said campaign committee press secretary Lauren Passalacqua. She said of the Republican Senate candidates: ""It's going to be very hard for them to put distance between themselves and Donald Trump.""Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said Mr. Trump will turn out voters who will support Republicans up and down the ballot.Many Republicans who are backing the presumptive nominee said they aren't certain whether joining team Trump will help or hurt their prospects. Jim Rubens, a New Hampshire Republican who is trying to unseat Sen. Kelly Ayotte in the GOP primary, cast his endorsement of Mr. Trump in February as a ""lightning rod.""""Either people love it or hate it -- there's not much in between,"" said Mr. Rubens, a former state senator. ""People advised me to steer clear -- you're safer that way. But it's not my political style.""Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Beth Reinhard",7/13/16
Could Donald Trump Implode?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787448174?accountid=12768,"The week that Donald Trump all but wrapped up the Republican nomination for President should have been a time of reaching out to adversaries and trying to repair his party's breach. Instead the New Yorker has launched what appears to be an attempt to purge anyone who won't immediately sign onto what he calls ""the Trump train.""Mr. Trump's threats against GOP doubters escalated over the weekend, especially against House Speaker Paul Ryan for saying on Thursday he wasn't yet ready to endorse the businessman. The two men are set to meet in Washington on Thursday. But in the meantime Mr. Trump is resorting to political threats to force Mr. Ryan to bend to his will.On Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Mr. Trump suggested he might try to strip the Speaker of his role as chairman of the GOP convention in Cleveland in July unless Mr. Ryan endorses him. ""I will give you a very solid answer, if that happens, about one minute after that happens, OK?"" Mr. Trump said. ""But there's no reason to give it right now, but I'll be very quick with the answer.""The Trump camp also unleashed Sarah Palin to announce on CNN that Mr. Ryan's career is probably ""over"" and she will lead an effort to defeat him in his Republican primary in Wisconsin later this year.""I think Paul Ryan is soon to be 'Cantored,' as in Eric Cantor,"" said Mrs. Palin, who endorsed Mr. Trump in Iowa before he lost to Ted Cruz. Mr. Cantor, the former House Majority Leader, lost his Virginia primary in 2014. Mrs. Palin resides in her own private Idaho, but her threats echo those from other Trump advocates.Mr. Trump keeps saying he can win states like Wisconsin, and apparently he thinks the way to do it is by purging the Ryan wing of the GOP from the new Trump Party. ""Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!"" Mr. Trump tweeted on May 6.But the Republican Party is not one of his golf courses for which he can determine who has what tee times. A political party is an alliance of people who share enough principles to unite to win elections and run the government. They can't be ordered around by Don Corleone-style threats. They have to be persuaded and mobilized. Are Mr. Trump and his campaign going to require loyalty oaths of every Republican officeholder who wants to attend the convention?All of this is more perilous for Mr. Trump's candidacy than he and his allies seem to appreciate. Like Mr. Ryan, hundreds of GOP officeholders and candidates are deciding whether to endorse Mr. Trump or keep their distance. Thousands of potential donors are deciding whether to support Mr. Trump or devote their efforts to staving off losses in the House and Senate.More immediately dangerous to his chances in November, some conservatives are trying to recruit a major GOP figure to run as a third-party candidate. We have discouraged this as likely to elect Hillary Clinton and perhaps lead to GOP losses down-ballot. The U.S. can't afford another run of unrestrained progressive government.In his own self-interest, Mr. Trump should be working overtime to prevent a third-party challenge that would attract Republicans and make his defeat likely. The more Mr. Trump declares war on party dissenters, the more Republicans he will convince that the Presidency is probably lost in any case and even a long-shot third-party campaign may be worth the political risk.Above all, now that Mr. Trump is the presumptive nominee, millions of Americans are looking at him as a potential President. They are watching with a new seriousness and making judgments about his character and political values that will be hard to change once they become fixed. This audience of voters is far larger than the 10.6 million who have supported him in the primaries.If Mr. Trump really wants to be President, as opposed to losing as a populist martyr, he has to build a broader coalition. He needs to persuade doubters not by lashing out but by sounding like a potential President. He needs to find a running mate people will respect and advisers willing to serve in his Administration. And he needs to give thoughtful speeches with specific ideas for reviving economic growth and keeping the country safe.Time is more fleeting than he seems to think. If he doesn't act more like a genuine leader soon, he may find that his candidacy has imploded before he is even nominated.",7/13/16
Election 2016: Trump's Chief Fundraiser Is an Unorthodox Choice,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1787893968?accountid=12768,"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who is facing a general-election tab that could exceed $1 billion, has tapped to raise that money a businessman with ties to two industries traditionally important in campaign finance, Wall Street and Hollywood, but with uncertain loyalties to Mr. Trump.Steven Mnuchin, the chief executive of the Dune Capital Management fund and a longtime banker, will serve as Mr. Trump's national finance chairman, the campaign announced last week. A former Goldman Sachs executive who has since helped arrange billions in financing for studios in Hollywood, where he now lives, Mr. Mnuchin is an unorthodox choice.He isn't an experienced political fundraiser, an attribute typically coveted by a presidential campaign; he has donated to more Democrats than Republicans; and his Rolodex includes current and former colleagues who might prove reluctant to donate to Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump's share of Wall Street contributions each month through March has never cracked 1%, while less than $6,000 of the $12 million he raised through March came from the entertainment industry. The campaign has found its top source of cash in the real-estate industry.Mr. Mnuchin, in an interview, said, ""For as long as I can remember voting,"" he has been a registered Republican.He said the campaign plans to announce its national finance committee in the ""next couple of weeks.""The Trump campaign declined a request for comment for this article.Time is of the essence for Mr. Trump, because of his late start to fundraising after largely self-funding his primary campaign. Mrs. Clinton has raised $213 million in the past year, on top of more than $67 million from her allied super PACs. She tapped Dennis Cheng to lead her fundraising efforts last February, before she announced her campaign.Mr. Mnuchin cautioned against measuring Mr. Trump's support in the financial and film industries, because the GOP candidate is only just engaging in a serious fundraising effort. And some Wall Street donors have already said they plan to back him, including billionaire investor Ken Langone and hedge-fund founder Anthony Scaramucci.""Do we expect that we will be raising funds and will get support from the film and finance industry? We do,"" he said, adding that Mr. Trump's negative comments about Wall Street were ""very specific as opposed to broad-based comments.""On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has made Wall Street and hedge funds targets of criticism, while accusing campaign donors across the board of seeking special favors. The real-estate billionaire has spent months attacking Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin's former employer, and has said that under the tax code, hedge-fund managers are ""getting away with murder.""Mr. Mnuchin said his role in the campaign stems from a ""long-standing personal and professional relationship"" with Mr. Trump after first meeting him 15 years ago.The two men were both born into well-off New York families. They have attended dinner parties at each other's Manhattan homes, Mr. Mnuchin said.Before Mr. Trump formally launched his presidential bid, the two men discussed his candidacy over dinner in Los Angeles, Mr. Mnuchin said.Mr. Mnuchin attended Mr. Trump's victory speech after the New York primary. The following morning, the Trump campaign asked if he would consider taking the finance role, and he agreed.Mr. Mnuchin's donation history and professional associations are also likely to provide fodder for Mr. Trump's Republican critics, who worry about his conservative credentials.Mr. Mnuchin -- who previously worked for a fund founded by Democratic megadonor George Soros -- has given mostly to Democrats in recent years, including more than $7,000 donated to Mrs. Clinton's past campaigns.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Mnuchin brings to the table a history of complex business dealings. After leaving Goldman, Mr. Mnuchin turned one of the biggest bank failures ever, IndyMac Bank, into a very lucrative investment.---Gregory Zuckerman and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus, Rachel Louise Ensign and Ben Fritz",7/14/16

Mike Pence as his running mate.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee announced his choice of Mr. Pence in a Twitter post Friday morning -- a day after news first leaked that he would pick the experienced conservative. A formal announcement is planned for Saturday.Mr. Pence, a top Republican House leader during the financial crisis, was critical of the government's decision to bail out financial institutions, and later fought efforts to pass the 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul law , arguing it codified government bailouts and gave regulators enormous power to break up financial institutions. He called for repealing Dodd-Frank shortly after President Barack Obama signed it into law.Here is a selection of his views on financial regulation:Opposing Government BailoutsMr. Pence voted against the government's $700 billion bailout to help stabilize the U.S. the financial system in 2008--a measure signed into law by President George W. Bush. In a March 2009 interview with CNN, he called the government's request to Congress to rescue insurance giant American International Group Inc. ""an extraordinary power grab by the federal government.""Mr. Pence has supported using bankruptcy proceedings rather than bailouts. ""The American people have had it with borrowing and spending and bailouts,"" he said in December 2009.Still, Mr. Pence didn't rule out tougher regulation of financial instruments, like derivatives, which exacerbated the 2008 crisis. ""We need some new reasonable regulation, but we don't need just some massive new bailout,"" he said in the CNN interview.Unwinding Dodd-FrankShortly after President Barack Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law in 2010, Mr. Pence, then-chairman of the House Republican Conference, called for an immediate repeal.""About $3.7 trillion in taxpayer dollars have already been spent on bailouts of the financial system, and the American people have said, 'No more,'"" he said in a July 2010 statement. ""We need to repeal this new big government program and replace it with common sense reform that protects taxpayers from bailouts, helps put Americans back to work and deals with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.""At the time, Mr. Pence said Dodd-Frank would codify the government's authority to bail out failing U.S. companies and give it the ability to break up any bank they thought was becoming too-big-to-fail.Curbing the Fed's CloutIn 2010, Mr. Pence introduced a bill that would have required the Fed to focus only on managing inflation, ending the dual mandate to promote full employment. The measure, which never made headway in the Democratic-controlled Congress, was in response to the Fed's policy of using quantitative easing to curb high unemployment rates--a policy many Republicans and conservative economists opposed.Now, with a Republican Congress, GOP proposals to rein in the Fed's powers have gained steam, including a House-passed measure placing strict transparency requirements on Fed policy-making.Wall Street DonationsThroughout his congressional career, Mr. Pence leaned heavily on the financial industry to fill his campaign coffers. The securities and investment sector contributed $376,311 to Pence congressional campaigns and the commercial banking sector donated $224,889, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Write to Donna Borak at donna.borak@wsj.com and Gabriel T.

The securities and investment sector contributed $376,311 to Pence congressional campaigns and the commercial banking sector donated $224,889, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Write to Donna Borak at donna.borak@wsj.com and Gabriel T.

Boone Pickens, who on Wednesday endorsed presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, is planning to host a fundraising event for the pro-Trump super PAC next month, the first major effort by the super PAC to raise money.Mr. Pickens, chairman of the hedge fund BP Capital, has invited Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the super PAC, to his Texas ranch in mid-June, along with a few other fundraising officials from the group. The goal is to raise money for the super PAC and bolster party unity, a spokesman for Mr. Pickens said.An official with the super PAC, called Great America PAC, said the group aims to invite about 20 people to the event. On the invitation list so far are media mogul Stan Hubbard -- who has said he supports Mr. Trump -- and Doug Lebda, founder of the online lending exchange LendingTree. Pete Wilson, former governor of California, is expected to attend.The super PAC has struggled to raise money in recent months as Mr. Trump bashed candidates for relying on wealthy outside groups to boost their campaigns. The group raised $550,000 through the end of March. Now that Mr. Trump pivots to the general election and announced last week he would more actively raise money for his campaign, the super PAC has had calls pouring in, according to an official.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",7/15/16
Election 2016: Status Lift for Early Trump Backers --- Group of mostly little- known lawmakers now have ear of GOP's new standard-bearer,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788190400?accountid=12768,"Rep. Chris Collins, a two-term congressman from New York who has rarely spoken on the House floor, hoped to book three national television appearances this year. Since he became the first House Republican to endorse Donald Trump for president in February, he has given more than 60 TV interviews.""I will never forget how you were with me since the beginning,"" he recalled Mr. Trump telling him.Mr. Collins is one of a small posse of mostly little-known lawmakers whose early backing of the New York businessman's candidacy means they suddenly have the ear of their party's new standard-bearer.They also are on the front lines of Mr. Trump's efforts to unify a divided GOP, starting Thursday with the first visit to Capitol Hill since he became the presumptive nominee. Mr. Trump is slated to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has withheld his support so far, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said he will back the nominee, and other congressional GOP leaders.""There's 247 House Republicans all running for re-election, and the more people see us on the stump talking positively about Mr. Trump for the next six months, the more those negatives about Mr. Trump will become an afterthought,"" Mr. Collins said.On the night last week when Mr. Trump all but clinched the nomination by winning the Indiana primary, he had endorsements from only 12 of the 300 Republicans in Congress. The early converts said backing Mr. Trump long before he drove his last two rivals out of the race gave them greater access to his campaign.""We can communicate well,"" Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the only senator in the early pro-Trump group, said of his ability to reach the candidate.Mr. Collins, a 65-year-old millionaire executive and lifelong Boy Scout from upstate New York, is co-chairing Mr. Trump's congressional outreach with an unlikely partner: Rep. Duncan Hunter (R., Calif.), a 39-year-old ex-Marine from the San Diego suburbs who vaped during a recent congressional hearing to promote electronic cigarettes.Mr. Trump's ground-floor supporters also include Rep. Lou Barletta (R., Pa.), a former small-town mayor who built a national profile by cracking down on firms that hire illegal immigrants; Rep. Tom Marino (R., Pa.), an ex-factory worker who became a U.S. prosecutor; and Kevin Cramer, (R., N.D.), a former state government official.Only a couple of early Trump backers, Rep. Jeff Miller (R., Fla.) and Bill Shuster (R., Pa.), are committee chairmen. Most are lower-ranking.For some lawmakers, backing Mr. Trump is a nod to the will of constituents more than a deep-rooted agreement with his policies. Rep. Renee Ellmers (R., N.C.) said her realization came in talking to voters in the week before her state's March primary. ""So many were going to vote for Trump and it just really clicked with me that he's having a conversation with the American people that [Republicans] haven't been,"" she said.Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Kristina Peterson",7/15/16
The Ryan-Trump Summit,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788165867?accountid=12768,"Paul Ryan and Donald Trump are the two leaders in the Republican Party's Cold War. Which one is the U.S. and the other the Soviet Union is beside the point. What matters is that Republican Party factions -- once again -- are on the nuclear brink. On Thursday the two men will hold a summit meeting at a neutral site, with the Republican National Committee headquarters serving as Reykjavik.Mr. Ryan has said he isn't ready to endorse Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump replied that if the Speaker can't support him, so what?Suffice to say that before now, it wouldn't have occurred to anyone that a party platform of mutually assured destruction was a strategy for winning the presidency.Anyone who went through the U.S. education system before it fell apart is familiar with the saying: ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" The man who said that was talking about the human compulsion to repeat national nightmares.Stepping back from a nightmarish brink is precisely what House Republicans did mere months ago, when they elected Mr. Ryan as House Speaker. Some seem to have forgotten what a corrosive, destructive and potentially self-annihilating mess that was for the Republicans. And here they go again.Last September, under siege from the most conservative members of the Republican House Conference, John Boehner announced his intention to resign as Speaker.His presumptive successor, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, abruptly ended his candidacy to succeed Mr. Boehner, and House Republicans descended into chaos.The House's 40 or so conservatives, the Freedom Caucus, seemed unappeasable. Insults and threats of retribution were rife. The White House and indeed pretty much everyone mocked the Republicans as ungovernable and incapable of governing.Faction is inevitable in politics, and America's Founders understood that faction was among the greatest threats to their government. Last fall, the Republican Party was there, at the precipice.Instead, these factions agreed that Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin should stand for Speaker, in the virtually unanimous belief that he was the only person who could -- if you'll excuse the word -- ""unify"" the party.The ascension of Paul Ryan then didn't have that much to do with what Mr. Trump referred to as the Speaker's ""agenda,"" but with Mr. Ryan's credibility as an honest broker. Policy differences aside, Mr. Ryan since that bloodbath has been the party's one identifiable political anchor.The unity in the House held even during the presidential primaries and debates, when the party's 700 presidential candidates were insulting each other into oblivion.The Ryan-Trump summit will be watched for one thing: to see if the Republicans intend to secure the presidency as a party divided, or as reasonably united.Mr. Trump has suggested he's willing to run with the party divided. A disunified party is a dangerous course, from the top of the ticket and across the GOP ballot.Republicans have been called to public account already for their inability to govern, and the public's greatest doubt about Mr. Trump is whether he indeed could govern the U.S.In negotiating the treacherous politics of the Republican Party, Mr. Trump should not underestimate the minefield his old sparring partner Ted Cruz created with the government shutdown in 2013. Nerves were rubbed raw in the Senate and House, and the Ryan speakership last October was the salve.Sarah Palin's threat to ""primary"" Mr. Ryan reopens these wounds and revives the recent images -- for voters and donors -- of a party that is genetically ungovernable. The moment has arrived to reduce faction, not foment it.The current narrative holds that the Ryan agenda and the Trump candidacy are irreconcilable, especially on immigration and trade. At bottom, though, I think both men want the same thing.Donald Trump has the better way of putting it: Make America Great Again. Paul Ryan's version, the one that runs back to Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp, is: Restore economic growth.Donald Trump and Paul Ryan should use Thursday's meeting as the start of a conversation on restoring economic growth. Both men understand that Barack Obama's seven years of zero to 2% growth is killing the American public.Reversing that Obama economic legacy is essentially the only thing Paul Ryan thinks about. It is the reality that has made Donald Trump the party's presumptive nominee.The differences on trade and immigration matter. But even here both men recognize that horrible growth has made productive thought on either subject virtually impossible. And both know that if growth doesn't get better, whoever wins in November will be a one-term president.Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic Party's two leading figures, have given up on growth and now propose to anesthetize the American people to the Obama reality with the narcotic of ""free"" handouts.Neither the entrepreneur businessman nor the Reaganite Speaker is ready to throw in the towel. Thursday's summit could be the beginning of a useful, if not beautiful, relationship.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",7/15/16
"Trump vs. Clinton, Beyond the Cage Match",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788165777?accountid=12768,"This presidential campaign is good at producing attention-grabbing train wrecks. Last week Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump as ""a loose cannon."" In turn, Mr. Trump called Mrs. Clinton ""the total enabler"" of her husband's affairs, and then he suggested that America repudiate some of its national debt.This kind of back-and-forth in the 25 weeks left before Election Day may draw attention. But what will largely decide the contest -- what will sway voters in the end -- is the candidates' success in emphasizing their principal selling points and undermining each other's.Mrs. Clinton argues that experience and temperament make her more qualified. Mr. Trump only claims that he will bring about necessary change. Polling shows both narratives have traction.In the April NBC/Wall Street Journal survey, 53% of voters rated Mrs. Clinton good or very good on ""being knowledgeable and experienced enough to handle the presidency""; 26% graded her poor or very poor. By comparison, only 21% rated Mr. Trump good or very good, and 61% poor or very poor. When pollsters asked if Mrs. Clinton had the ""right temperament"" for the job, 41% rated her positively. Only 12% said that of Mr. Trump.Team Clinton will attempt to depict Mr. Trump as ignorant and unbalanced. Mrs. Clinton pounced this week when John Dickerson asked her on ""Face the Nation"" about the ""loose cannon"" remark. She attacked Mr. Trump for saying Japan and South Korea should acquire nuclear weapons, for declaring NATO obsolete, and for arguing the U.S. should target the families of terrorists, ""which would be a war crime.""For good measure, she rapped him for his comments on abortion: ""When he says women should be punished for having abortions, what does that mean?"" She suggested his comments on the debt demonstrate that ""he just doesn't understand that running our government is not the same as making real estate deals."" One difficulty of this approach is that it further paints Mrs. Clinton as status quo, a third term for President Obama.Mr. Trump's appeal comes from a powerful desire for change. In the recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 24% of voters thought America was ""generally headed in the right direction,"" and 70% felt ""that things are off on the wrong track."" These numbers are historically high and have been getting worse. Desire for change like this has led to defeat in six of the seven modern elections when a party was striving for a third White House term.But the real-estate mogul has yet to convince enough people he is the man to set America back on track. When pollsters asked if Mr. Trump would bring ""real change to the direction of the country,"" 37% of voters responded positively, and 43% negatively. Mrs. Clinton's numbers on the same question were 22% positive and 49% negative.The reality-TV star's problem is that voters don't give him the overwhelming edge on change that Mrs. Clinton enjoys on experience and temperament. Not being Hillary is good, but insufficient. His challenge is twofold: He must show that his business experience better prepares him to be president than Mrs. Clinton's years in government prepare her. And he must demonstrate a satisfactory grasp on what needs to be done, so that voters conclude he has what it takes to bring about change.Mr. Trump rarely goes beyond applause lines. One of his best is a call to care for veterans. Why not couple this with an attack on Mrs. Clinton for claiming last fall that mismanagement at Veterans Affairs ""has not been as widespread as it has been made out to be""? Hillary opposes the main alternative to the broken VA system, namely Sen. John McCain's proposal to allow veterans to get care from private doctors at the government's expense: Mr. Trump should extol this legislation at every opportunity.The New York businessman could also attack efforts by government-employee unions to water down measures making it easier to fire or demote VA officials. He might offer up one of his patented slogans: ""If you abuse a vet, you're fired.""But adding substance to his campaign requires preparation and discipline, traits Mr. Trump lacks. His team demonstrates little interest in fleshing out his agenda, apparently convinced that Mr. Trump can roll to the White House on tweets and personal attacks alone.Maybe, but winning a general election is different than prevailing in a 17-way primary with 40% support. Unless Mr. Trump gets better at reassuring skeptical swing voters, Mrs. Clinton could overcome the strong desire for change afoot in the land.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",7/15/16
Hillary Clinton Talks Racial Inequality at NAACP Conference; Calls Donald Trump a prominent voice in the 'birther' movement who 'plays coy with white supremacists',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804991611?accountid=12768,"CINCINNATI-- A room of black leaders fell silent Monday as Hillary Clinton read a passage from a recent social media post made by one of the Baton Rouge, La., police officers killed over the weekend, part of the presumptive Democratic nominee's effort to advance a message she said would stand in contrast to the Republican National Convention kicking off a few hours north.""'Please don't let hate infect your heart,'"" Mrs. Clinton read to attendees of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's annual convention, quoting a Facebook post from Montrell Jackson, one of three police officers fatally shot by a gunman in Baton Rouge on Sunday morning.""He wrote so honestly and powerfully about the struggle of being black and wearing blue today in America,"" Mrs. Clinton said.Earlier in her remarks, she emphasized that anyone who kills a police officer or helps kill an officer must be held accountable. ""There can be no justification. No looking the other way,"" she said.As the Republican Party opened its convention in Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton spoke at length about the spate of deaths in recent weeks--including the police-involved shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two black men, as well as the killings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge--at one point suggesting the threat of gun violence might reach the convention itself.""The wrong people keep getting their hands on guns. And not any guns: military-style weapons,"" she said, adding that ""that's why"" Cleveland's largest police union had asked for a suspension of the state's ""open carry"" gun law.The Republican National Committee's national director of African-American initiatives and media, Telly Lovelace, said Monday afternoon in response to Mrs. Clinton's remarks to the NAACP that ""Hillary Clinton's platitudes on gun control and public safety will not ensure an America in which both civilians and law enforcement can feel safe in their own neighborhoods.""Noting that Donald Trump had declined the NAACP's invitation to speak, Mrs. Clinton took sharp aim at the Republican nominee, telling the crowd, ""Donald Trump led the movement to delegitimize our first black president, trumpeting the so-called 'birther' movement.""Mr. Trump was a prominent voice in the movement questioning President Barack Obama's nationality. The White House released Mr. Obama's official, long-form birth certificate in 2011 confirming he was born in Honolulu.""Donald Trump plays coy with white supremacists,"" she added, before criticizing his comments about Mexican immigrants and women, and his proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S.Mainly, however, she trained her comments on policing, criminal-justice concerns and race relations. While urging punishment for attacks against police officers, she spoke about tense times between minority communities and their local law-enforcement officials.""There is, as you know so well, another hard truth at the heart of this complex matter: many African-Americans fear the police,"" she said.""Ending systemic racism requires contributions from us all, especially those of us who haven't experienced it ourselves,"" she said. ""We white Americans need to do a better job when African-Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers you face every day. We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume our experiences are everyone's experiences.""Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comCredit: By Erica Orden",7/18/16

"Trump, Ryan Edge Closer",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788484087?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump began the process of narrowing their differences Thursday as the fractured party works to coalesce around its unorthodox candidate.Although House Speaker Paul Ryan again stopped short of endorsing Mr. Trump, he said they found common agreement on ""core principles"" of the GOP, including the appointment of conservative Supreme Court judges, opposition to abortion and the desire to defeat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November.Some congressional leaders pressed the businessman to tone down his most contentious rhetoric, but Mr. Trump's success in galvanizing GOP voters has dealt him a strong hand in negotiating a truce with Mr. Ryan and other holdouts on Capitol Hill.One week after Mr. Trump effectively clinched the GOP presidential nomination with a decisive win in Indiana, he met with party leaders in a trio of meetings.Mr. Ryan (R., Wis), Mr. Trump's most prominent skeptic, pointed to lingering policy differences between them, but delivered his most positive assessment to date of Mr. Trump.""Look, it's no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today,"" Mr. Ryan told reporters.""We are now planting the seeds to get ourselves unified,"" Mr. Ryan said. ""I was very encouraged with this meeting, but this is a process. It takes a little time.""Mr. Trump put out a joint statement Thursday with Mr. Ryan expressing confidence that they can ""unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal.""Republicans have a limited window in which to hash out their disagreements. Some Trump supporters believe Mr. Ryan and others should fall in line behind the GOP alternative to Mrs. Clinton well before the party's convention in late July.""We need to be totally united by the end of this month,"" said Rep. Chris Collins of New York, the first House Republican to endorse Mr. Trump.Other prominent Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and on Thursday, former House Speaker John Boehner, have said Republicans should defer to GOP voters who chose Mr. Trump as their nominee.In a particularly striking bit of fence mending, even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) -- one of Mr. Trump's former presidential rivals and most vociferous critics -- said Thursday that he had a ""cordial, funny"" phone conversation about national security issues with Mr. Trump, whom he isn't endorsing, that lasted more than 15 minutes Wednesday. ""The campaign is over,"" said Mr. Graham. ""He won.""But Mr. Ryan, widely expected to mount a future presidential campaign, has been unwilling to paper over the deep policy differences between Mr. Trump and his own brand of fiscal and social conservatism. The two have split on numerous policy stances, including a new Pacific trade deal, the scope of Social Security, an overhaul of the immigration system and major tenets of economic policy.In his first huddle with Mr. Trump Thursday morning, Mr. Ryan took the GOP nominee through slides on the federal budget, according to a lawmaker present at one of the meetings.Mr. Ryan recognizes that some of Mr. Trump's policy stances will prevail for now, lawmakers said. In a meeting with Mr. Trump's supporters Wednesday, Mr. Ryan made clear that Mr. Trump's opposition to the Pacific trade deal wasn't a ""disqualifier"" to him, Mr. Collins said.""That was an issue Mr. Trump ran on. He has won our nomination, and that's going to be a difference in opinion,"" the New York lawmaker said.Many Republicans are anxious about Mr. Trump because his positions on major issues such as taxes and abortion are either lacking in detail or subject to change. But that inconsistency may help him build party unity if he proves willing to drop some of his most incendiary proposals -- such as his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S.In a Fox News radio interview Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the idea wasn't a policy set in stone. ""This is just a suggestion until we find out what's going on,"" he said.Senate Republicans said in their own meeting with Mr. Trump they broached the issue of his inflammatory rhetoric on issues including immigration, which many worry could provoke a backlash with Hispanic voters.""I said, 'There is a way to talk about these issues that people don't find offensive and yet still makes the point that we're all for a secure border,' and he listened,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R., Texas.)But some Republicans noted that Mr. Trump's appeal has stemmed in large part from his willingness to stray from the usual political scripts.""With all due respect to the people who think he should change his tone, he's the one running for president and he's the one being successful,"" said Rep. Scott Perry (R., Pa.).Mr. Trump's coterie on Capitol Hill Thursday included top campaign officials Paul Manafort and Corey Lewandowski, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a real-estate investor and newspaper owner. Mr. Ryan, who led the meeting with House GOP leaders, sat with Mr. Trump at the head of the table, according to a lawmaker who was there.At the Republican National Committee, where Mr. Trump met with Mr. Ryan and members of his leadership team, the sidewalk had a carnival-like atmosphere.

Trump's Money Games,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788483786?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump the Businessman is fond of noting that the ""best investments"" are sometimes ""the ones you don't make."" Donald Trump the Presumptive Nominee may be discovering that the rules of politics aren't always the rules of business -- at least when it comes to money.Mr. Trump is taking hits for his switcheroo last week on self-funding his campaign. The man who pummeled his primary competitors as ""puppets"" of large donors now will actively court those same donors, to underwrite what could be a $1.5 billion general-election campaign against Hillary Clinton. He is promising to erect a ""world-class finance operation.""He'll have to, if he wants to overcome a stunning financial handicap against the Democratic money juggernaut. The handicap is one of Mr. Trump's own making. He chose not to ""invest"" in his primary run by laying the groundwork necessary for the general election. That decision may now prove his biggest hurdle to the White House.Mr. Trump is brilliant at identifying issues that resonate with voters, and he early-on sniffed the benefit of claiming that he was ""self-funding"" his primary campaign.In hindsight, it was a foolish move. It also wasn't true. Of the $47 million Mr. Trump spent through March, $11 million came through outside donations. Small donations or not, this was other people's money.The other $36 million came in the form of a ""loan"" by Mr. Trump to his campaign. That's key. People who lend money do so in the expectation of getting it back. And with his announcement that he will now openly solicit donations, we can expect that the fundraising will pay back the loan. The self-funding candidate was a mirage.The bigger liability of the self-funding pose was its shortsightedness. Mr. Trump has presumably long known that even bargain-basement general-election presidential campaigns these days run at least $1 billion. It was ludicrous to think he ever intended to cover such a phenomenal number -- even if he could have afforded it.Yes, Mr. Trump is rich. But there is clearly a reason he is refusing to release his tax returns. (His explanation, that some of them are being audited by the IRS, is laughable.) One guess is that his returns show tax-lowering deductions and accounting vehicles that aren't available to the average Joe and risk making Mr. Trump look tax-dodgerish.A likelier possibility: Mr. Trump may be rich, he isn't liquid-rich. His wealth could be tied up in real estate or investments. Mr. Trump in 2006 sued Timothy O'Brien for defamation, claiming that the book author had understated his personal wealth. In the course of a deposition, Mr. Trump admitted that his ""net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings.""Before the suit was dismissed in 2009, Mr. Trump had to turn over his tax returns. They are under seal, and the reporter hasn't provided details, but in a recent interview he speculated that Mr. Trump isn't releasing his IRS documents because ""you see what his income actually is in those returns."" Mr. Trump might never have had enough cash to fund a White House run.If that's the case, and yet he stuck to his self-funding line, it was sheer political malpractice. Candidates spend years building donor networks, collecting names and numbers of prospective supporters. Their national parties depend on the information to hone their databases for fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts. An essential role of primary races is identifying best-prospect voters.Mr. Trump's indifference to harvesting the information or dollars of his supporters is all the more extraordinary because many of them are first-time or occasional voters who wouldn't otherwise exist in the Republican National Committee data. The other day, Mr. Trump said he thinks voter data is ""overrated.""Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton has raised more than $213 million. Her super PAC has banked another $67 million. She started a joint campaign fund with the Democratic National Committee more than eight months ago, which has already raised $60 million. Mr. Trump is just starting, and he still hasn't fully blessed a super PAC effort. Many major GOP donors remain on the sidelines. And it's nine weeks to the Republican convention.Yet Mr. Trump needs that cash, like, yesterday. The Clinton campaign is already lambasting him. One of Mitt Romney's biggest mistakes was sitting silent early in the 2012 general election, partly for lack of money, while the Obama campaign pounded him as a craven capitalist. By the time the Romney campaign engaged in the fall, it was too late.Mr. Trump coasted through the primaries on an estimated $2 billion in free media, but he shouldn't count on such helpful coverage now. With a Democratic presidency at stake, reporters will feel a duty to finally start digging into his past.A pity that Mr. Trump didn't stand on principle from the start. His wealth alone would have allowed him to proclaim his independence, even as he harvested the data and dollars of the many. He wouldn't be scrabbling for excuses now, and he might be beating Hillary in the only other race he needs to win between now and Election Day.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",7/18/16
A Trump-Ryan Modus Vivendi,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788483660?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump met with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and the presumptive GOP nominee and House Speaker Paul Ryan seemed prepared to de-escalate their recent stand-off. A peaceful coexistence, however uneasy, is for now in the interests of both men.In a joint statement after the session -- merely the second time Messrs. Trump and Ryan have talked in person -- they said they had a constructive conversation and would work together ""to unify our party and win this fall."" They added that, ""While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground.""The philosophic and stylistic differences between the New Yorker and Wisconsinite are deeper than that -- though both realism and common sense argue for a cease fire. Mr. Trump must know that defeating the Democratic machine will be difficult enough, even without opening a second front against the Republican Party's most senior elected officials.Mr. Trump also showed some welcome magnanimity. His initial instinct after Mr. Ryan said he wasn't ready to endorse him was to respond with bullying and demands. He has since taken a more conciliatory turn. The businessman disavowed Sarah Palin's vow to defeat Mr. Ryan in his primary, saying she was ""very much a free agent.""Maybe Mr. Trump has realized that if he does win the White House, he'll need help to make America great again. Mr. Trump is an unreliable guide to his own agenda, as his multiple positions on tax reform in recent days attest. He'll need congressional assistance filling out those details, as well as reforming Veterans Affairs and rebuilding the military.As for Mr. Ryan, he confronts the reality that Mr. Trump is the GOP nominee, for better or worse. His obligation is to limit any policy and political damage. In the statement and at a press conference, the Speaker made sure to recognize the new voters Mr. Trump says he is bringing into the Republican tent. By the nature of his office, the Speaker is right to show respect for opposing views.But that doesn't mean abandoning his core principles, or the independence to criticize Mr. Trump on the merits when appropriate. Mr. Ryan is still withholding a formal endorsement. His critics on the left and right are nonetheless portraying the meeting as the first surrender among many to Trumpism.The liberal tears are of the crocodile genus. The liberals who claim to be alarmed about Mr. Trump are elated that he offers them a chance to retake the House and Senate.The conservatives assailing Mr. Ryan for being insufficiently anti-Trump shouldn't abet this strategy. A GOP House could be the last defense against Hillary Clinton's worst economic proposals, and avoiding a nuclear exchange with Mr. Trump may be the only way to protect it. Mr. Ryan needs the pragmatic flexibility to navigate whatever surprises this election throws up next.These critics should also be thinking about the best interests of the country if Mr. Trump wins. Mr. Ryan would then be crucial to steering a Trump agenda in a constructive direction, as well as providing a check on the New Yorker's worst instincts on trade or foreign policy. Would the never-Trumpers prefer a GOP House run by Mr. Ryan, or by one of the early Trump supporters like California's Duncan Hunter?Mr. Ryan is trying to preserve the GOP as a movement dedicated to inclusive economic growth and government reform. If an armistice avoids a mutual self-destruct sequence, he'll be proven shrewder than his critics.",7/18/16

"Election 2016: Trump Goes His Own Way With Putin --- Warm words and push to improve ties with Moscow aren't shared by Obama, GOP rivals",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788694676?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump made an unusual public overture to Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2013, trying to gin up publicity for an event he was co-hosting that year.""Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow -- if so, will he become my new best friend?"" the real estate magnate tweeted.That appeal came less than 24 hours after President Barack Obama and Mr. Putin held a tense, unproductive meeting at a summit of world leaders in Northern Ireland as they sparred over how to de-escalate the conflict in Syria. ""Our positions do not fully coincide,"" Mr. Putin said afterward.Mr. Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, has proposed redrawing a wide range of U.S. policies, including tax and immigration rules, trade agreements and engagement in the Middle East. But in no area has he been more persistent -- and perhaps more consistent -- than his call to improve relations with Mr. Putin, an authoritarian figure often at odds with the U.S.Mr. Trump's views on Mr. Putin separate him not just from Mr. Obama but from his former GOP rivals and from conservatives as well as liberals. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) has called Mr. Putin a ""gangster and a thug,"" and Democratic front-funner Hillary Clinton has termed him a bully, while Mr. Trump calls him ""very bright"" and a ""strong leader.""It is unclear whether Messrs. Trump and Putin have spoken since the campaign began.""I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia -- from a position of strength only -- is possible, absolutely possible,"" Mr. Trump said in a foreign-policy speech at Washington's Mayflower Hotel in April. ""Some say the Russians won't be reasonable. I intend to find out.""The origin of Mr. Trump's affection for Russia is unclear. He traveled to Moscow in the 1990s in search of real-estate deals, but his company isn't believed to have properties there. He said last week that his experience with Russian officials included hosting the 2013 Miss Universe event.Mr. Trump's primary diplomatic goal regarding Russia appears to be to let Mr. Putin deal with problems in Syria and elsewhere in the Mideast, allowing the U.S. to disengage.One proposal that has garnered positive Russian attention is Mr. Trump's suggestion that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization focus on combating terrorism instead of deterring Russian aggression. That alarms officials in Ukraine and the Baltics, former Soviet states that fear they could become Mr. Putin's next targets following Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea in early 2014.The Kremlin has signaled it is pleased with Mr. Trump's success and message.Mr. Trump ""says he wants to move to another level of relations, to closer and deeper relations with Russia -- how can we not welcome that?"" Mr. Putin said in December. ""Of course, we welcome it.""But Mr. Trump's rise has unsettled a number of veteran U.S. diplomats.""There's a mythology about foreign policy that it's just like deal making in the business world, and if you don't like 'the deal,' you can just walk away,"" said Michael McFaul, a critic of Mr. Trump and former U.S. ambassador to Russia under Mr. Obama. ""In foreign policy, you can't walk away. It can come back to bite you. It can create vacuums.""U.S. relations with Moscow have deteriorated in recent years, especially since the annexation of Crimea. Washington has chafed at Russia's backing for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Western diplomats believe Mr. Putin is looking for ways to aggressively assert Russia's regional and global influence.Mr. Trump isn't the first figure to speak of improving relations with Russia and Mr. Putin. The last two presidents have voiced similar aims, only to see their efforts founder in the face of geopolitical events.In 2001, then-President George W. Bush said after a meeting with Mr. Putin that ""I was able to get a sense of his soul,"" a remark that was widely derided, especially after Mr. Putin took aggressive actions like moving into neighboring Georgia in 2008.Mr. Obama's team also spoke of resetting relations with Russia, but he, too, has seen relations deteriorate, to the point that NATO has suspended much of its nascent cooperation with Russia.Although many conservative foreign-policy experts have balked at Mr. Trump's overtures to Russia, some agree that it may be time to rethink U.S.-Russia relations.""What we have now in the dynamics between Putin and Obama is very unhelpful,"" said Dimitri Simes, president of the Center for the National Interest, which hosted Mr. Trump's foreign-policy speech. ""Obama clearly does not trust Putin, does not like Putin, and doesn't hide it . . . . I think that Putin doesn't like Obama, is not afraid of Obama, and doesn't particularly respect Obama.""Credit: By Damian Paletta",7/19/16
Donald Trump's Amazon Adventure,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788694585?accountid=12768,"You might get some argument about exactly how illegal it is for politicians to use their law-enforcement powers to punish their political opponents.But at least when Nixon sought to, he felt obliged to do so by secret memorandum. As keeper of the enemies list John Dean wrote, ""This memorandum addresses the matter of how we can maximize the fact of our incumbency in dealing with persons known to be active in their opposition to our Administration; stated a bit more bluntly -- how we can use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.""As it happened, however, the IRS commissioner at the time, Donald Alexander, refused orders to carry out tax audits of the Nixon White House's political enemies.Today, nobody, not even his worst critics, expects to find a memo from President Obama instructing Lois Lerner at IRS to stonewall applications from conservative political groups for tax-exempt status.His critics probably don't even expect Mr. Obama to have muttered under his breath that such a thing would be desirable. Rather, Ms. Lerner, all on her own, seemingly decided as a loyal Democratic and ideological warrior that it would be a good thing to use her agency to hamper the president's partisan antagonists.In the Soviet Union under Stalin, extrajudicial punishment was institutionalized (though it sounds like an oxymoron) by the formation of the NKVD Special Troika, empowered to punish political enemies without necessity of evidence or trial.Donald Trump, an innovator in all things, is now in the process of changing the rules in America with his threat to bring legal action against Amazon on antitrust grounds and, if we hear him correctly, on tax grounds as well.Mr. Trump couldn't have been clearer about his motivation. He complained about Washington Post reporters calling up and ""asking ridiculous questions,"" ""all false stuff,"" apparently related to Mr. Trump's tax returns, which in defiance of all tradition he has refused to release, as well as Mr. Trump's real-estate dealings.Mr. Trump says the Post was purchased as ""a toy"" by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (who bought the paper with his personal funds in 2013). Mr. Trump says the paper now is being used to attack Mr. Trump in order to protect Amazon's alleged tax-dodging practices even though Amazon, after long resistance, has begun in recent years to collect state sales tax.All this seems to arise because the Post, the dominant newspaper in the nation's capital, has assigned reporters to investigate the business career of the candidate who champions his credibility to be president by referring to his business career.In a column exactly two months to the day before Mr. Trump's presidential announcement, we warned that 2016 would likely witness a revival of the ""GOP's antibusiness temptation,"" though we thought Warren Buffett should be the one to worry, having aligned himself with a Brazilian private-equity firm then ferociously downsizing such iconic American names as Budweiser and Burger King.Mr. Buffett, who long ago announced himself a Hillary supporter, and who often likes to be heard opining on all things, has gone strangely quiet on a potential Trump presidency.At the Berkshire annual meeting two weeks ago, where he is known to talk and talk, about a Trump presidency Mr. Buffett said pretty much: Hey, it's all the same to him. Trump. Hillary. What the heck, Berkshire can get along with anybody.Those were not his exact words, of course, but neither were there any pungent expressions of what we suspect were Mr. Buffett's true feelings about a wall on the southern border; or the idea of dispatching armed agents to round up and deport 11 million Mexicans and other Latin Americans living and working in our midst, in many cases for decades; or a trade war with China; or killing the wives and children of America's enemies, or engaging in torture even if it doesn't generate useful intelligence.Mr. Trump knows U.S. political culture well enough to know that gleefully, uninhibitedly threatening to use government's law-enforcement powers to attack news reporters and political opponents just isn't done.Maybe he thinks he can get away with it. Maybe he's trying to figure out how to disqualify himself for the presidency in a way that wouldn't embarrass his fans or blow back on the business career that he always imagined he'd be returning to after the Republican convention at the latest. After all, one way to throw an election is to scare off donors (he needs about a billion dollars) by flaunting his inner Nixon.Or maybe he really does want to be the American caudillo who flings American democratic and legal norms out the window and ushers in a new age of populist authoritarianism.Forgive us, even at this late date, for being one pundit who still can't quite take Mr. Trump so seriously.Credit: By Holman W.

Declarations: Mr. Trump Goes to Washington,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788694580?accountid=12768,"What is needed among Republicans in Washington now is patience, soberness of thought, and a kind of heroic fairness. Reflection and humility wouldn't hurt either.One of our two great parties is either shattering or reconstituting itself. It is not united and has not been since the George W. Bush era. As the pollster Kellyanne Conway noted this week, if it were, there wouldn't have been 17 candidates for president, and Donald Trump wouldn't be the presumptive nominee.The optimistic thought is that it is reconstituting itself. The past year the base of the party has been kicking away from its elected and established leaders in Washington and, simultaneously, broadening itself, with new members coming in. That suggests a certain dynamism: Maybe something's busy being born, not busy dying. We'll see.But almost every conservative and Republican in Washington -- in politics, think tanks and journalism -- backed a candidate other than Mr. Trump. Every one of those candidates lost, and Mr. Trump won. After November, think tanks and journals will begin holding symposia in which smart people explain How We Lost The Base.Mr. Trump's victory was an endorsement of Mr. Trump but also a rebuke to professional Republicans in Washington. It was a rebuke to comprehensive immigration plans that somehow, mysteriously, are never quite intended to stop illegal immigration; a rebuke to the kind of thinking that goes, ""I know, we'll pass laws that leave Americans without work, which means they'll be deprived of the financial and spiritual benefits of honest labor, then we'll cut their entitlements, because if we don't our country will go broke."" The voters backed Mr. Trump's stands on these issues and more.A political question for November: Does Mr. Trump pick up more Democrats than he loses Republicans? Is that how he plans to win? Does he draw in enough new or non-Republican voters to make up for the millions of Republican voters he will surely lose?In an act of determined denial, Washington Republicans and conservatives continue to see and describe Mr. Trump's nomination as the triumph of a celebrity in a culture that worships celebrity, the victory of a vulgarian in a vulgar age, the living excrescence of our shallow values and lowered standards. Also, he's tapped into the public's rage.He is all of those things. But he is more, and Washington is determined to ignore the more. He understood, either intuitively or after study, that the Republican base was changing or open to change, and would expand if the party changed some policies. He declared those policies changed. And he won.As to the matter of rage, it's more like disrespect for those who've been calling the shots. If you know Trump people in real life as opposed to through social media, if they are your friends and family members, you understand that ""rage"" doesn't do them justice. They dislike the Republican Party, which they believe has consistently betrayed them, but Trump people in person are just about the only cheerful people in politics this year. They actually have hope -- the system needs a hard electric shock, he's just the man to do it, and if it doesn't work they'll fire him. They're having a good time. Here I throw in a moment I had in Manhattan Thursday afternoon. I was standing on a corner on York Avenue in the 60s when a cab screeched across two lanes to stop in front of me. ""I am voting for Trump!"" the driver yelled through an open window. ""You want to know why? He is neither right or left!"" He then laughed and sped on. Not all Trump supporters are quiet about it.But back to the new Republicans -- the Democrats and independents who've voted for Mr. Trump. As usual with the Republican Party, these new friends were not cheerily invited in -- who would ever think of that? -- but crashed the party with the guy with the yellow hair. A lot of Washington Republicans seem to have spent the past week wondering what they always wonder: How much should we snub them? How uncomfortable should we make them? Should we not talk to them or just not give them a drink? Way to do outreach, fellas.It is good that Paul Ryan snapped out of his smug-seeming ""I'm just not ready"" approach of last week, and met and talked with Mr. Trump this week. When a sitting Republican speaker of the House is cool on or considering rejecting that party's presumptive presidential nominee, more is needed than ""I'm not there yet.""He has every right not to endorse Mr. Trump, but if he doesn't, both Mr. Trump and his supporters deserved more. You have to explain at length and with moral and intellectual seriousness and depth in exactly what ways he's not worthy of your support, and you have to do it in a way that summons a response that is equally thoughtful and temperate.Not much is known about the meeting at this point. Mr. Ryan told the press afterward that he was ""encouraged"" by their talk, but still declined to endorse.In a joint statement issued soon after, Messrs. Ryan and Trump said: ""It's critical that Republicans unite around our shared principles, advance a conservative agenda, and do all we can to win this fall."" They said they were ""honest about our few differences"" but ""there are also many important areas of common ground."" There was a nod to ""many millions of new voters,"" who showed up for the Republican primaries, ""far more than ever before in the Republican Party's history.""All of which strikes me as a Trump win. Mr. Ryan referred to his conservatism and suggested Mr. Trump holds political principles.Mr. Trump should want to bring the party together. He makes sounds that he doesn't need to, but he does and must know it or he wouldn't have met with GOP leaders in the first place. A party fracturing all around him will only spread unease, increase tension, and intensify sourness. He needs at least a semblance of calm so he doesn't look every day like Thor, God of Thunder and Battle.Those who oppose Mr. Trump should do it seriously and with respect for his supporters. If he is not conservative, make your case and explain what conservatism is. No one at this point needs your snotty potshots or your supposedly withering one-liners. I confess I have lost patience with many of those declaring they cannot in good conscience support him, not because reasons of conscience are not crucial -- they are, and if they apply they should be declared. But some making these declarations managed in good conscience, indeed with the highest degree of self-regard, to back the immigration proposals of George W. Bush that contributed so much to the crisis that produced Mr. Trump. They invented Sarah Palin. They managed to support the global attitudes and structures that left the working class jobless. They dreamed up the Iraq war.Sometimes I think their consciences are really not so delicate.As for the political consultants who insult Mr. Trump so vigorously, they are the ones who did most to invent him. What do they ever do in good conscience?Credit: By Peggy Noonan",7/19/16
. . . And Donald Trump's Taxes,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788694491?accountid=12768,"These columns warned Republican voters that Democrats and the media would make an issue of Donald Trump's tax returns -- after he was the GOP's presumptive nominee -- and that didn't take long. This week Hillary Clinton began what is likely to be a campaign from here to November to claim the businessman must be hiding something.Mr. Trump is helping the Democrats with his changing answers and obfuscation. In January the candidate said ""I have everything all approved and very beautiful"" and he hoped to release his returns ""over the next three, four months."" He later said he couldn't release his returns until the IRS finished auditing him, though the IRS says an audit is no barrier to public disclosure.Asked this week by the Associated Press when that day would come, Mr. Trump said he didn't plan to release them after all. After Mrs. Clinton and Mitt Romney criticized that statement, Mr. Trump fell back on the IRS audit excuse. Then on Friday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Mr. Trump said he didn't think voters had any right to see his tax returns and that his tax rate is ""none of your business.""Mr. Trump added: ""But I do say this. I will really gladly give them -- not going to learn anything but it's under routine audit. When the audit ends I'm gonna present them. That should be before the election. I hope it's before the election.""Keep in mind that it has been common practice since the 1970s for the presidential nominees of both parties to release their tax returns. Tax returns provide insight into a candidate's income, charitable giving and tax-avoidance strategies. Mr. Trump says he thinks voters don't care, but that's a decision for the voters to make.As for the politics, Mr. Romney paid a price for waiting until September 2012 to release his 2011 return. Hit man Harry Reid claimed he'd heard, while offering no evidence, that Mr. Romney hadn't paid taxes for 10 years. That was surely a lie, but the press corps still gave him headlines.Mrs. Clinton is also less than honest on the subject. In 1992 she and her husband appeared to be forthcoming after they had released their tax returns going back to 1980. But Americans later learned, after Mr. Clinton was elected, that their 1979 returns included the windfall income from her miraculous cattle-futures trading in Arkansas. That story would have been highly damaging had it emerged before the election.Mr. Trump may think all of this means he can resist this law of political gravity, and maybe he's right. But neither Democrats nor the media will give up the tax-return issue now that he's the Republican contender, and every time he's asked about it will distract from the other messages he's trying to deliver. The GOP voters who are nominating Mr. Trump can't say they didn't understand the Trumpian uncertainty they were buying.(See related article: ""REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Clinton Business Model . . ."" -- WSJ May 14, 2016)",7/19/16

"Hillary Clinton's Choice of Running Mate Highlights Battle for Virginia; Democrats say Donald Trump has few, if any, viable paths to victory if he doesn't win Virginia",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806154072?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Hillary Clinton's decision to tap Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate highlights the battle that will be fought in his home state of Virginia, a once reliable Republican stronghold that has become fertile ground for Democrats.With 13 electoral votes up for grabs and a diverse electorate spread across both swaths of suburbs and expansive rural areas, Virginia is expected to be a contested state where both presidential candidates could find pockets of support. Adding Mr. Kaine--a popular senator, former governor and former mayor--to the Democratic ticket could provide a modest but meaningful boost to Mrs. Clinton in this key state, strategists said.""It's not necessarily decisive, but there's a fair amount of evidence it can help at least a little bit,"" Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said of the vice presidential pick. ""You have to assume that every little thing you do that gets you a little bit closer is worth doing.""Polls show Mrs. Clinton is playing from a position of strength in Virginia right now. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist Poll found Mrs. Clinton with a comfortable, single-digit lead there. In a head-to-head matchup in Virginia, the former secretary of state had 44% to Republican candidate Donald Trump's 35%.But Democrats acknowledge that the race in this battleground state could tighten. And Republicans describe Virginia as a state that is winnable but not necessarily a must-win for them.Republican presidential candidates had a long history of winning Virginia that stretched through the 2004 election. But then-Sen. Barack Obama broke that streak, notching a victory in the state in 2008 and again four years later.Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, acknowledged that Virginia had turned purple in recent years. But the RNC has responded by beefing up its game in the state, putting more boots on the ground and a more experienced staff in Virginia for this year's campaign, he said.""Donald Trump does not have to win Virginia to win the White House,"" Mr. Short said. ""But winning the state gives you more pathways to 270 (electoral votes).""Some Democrats disagreed, saying Mr. Trump has few, if any, viable paths to victory if he doesn't win Virginia.People close to former President Bill Clinton said Mr. Kaine was his top choice as his wife's running mate. One person said Mr. Clinton believes that if his wife wins Virginia, the Republican ticket has virtually no realistic path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.Virginia is one of the most important states in play this year, said Mitch Stewart, who was state director for Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign and oversaw all battleground states for him in 2012. Michigan and Pennsylvania are most important, he said, because if Mrs. Clinton can block Mr. Trump there, then he has almost no way to win the election. But after that, he points to Virginia.""One of the reasons why it's such a battleground state is because it really represents our country,"" he said. ""Thirty percent of Virginia is nonwhite. You have large swaths of really, really highly educated whites, and then you have rural areas. Virginia really does probably best represent the country as a whole demographically.""Mrs. Clinton is positioned to do well there, he said. Mr. Kaine could make a minor difference, he added.When Mr. Kaine was under consideration for Mr. Obama's running mate in 2008, the campaign tested the effect of adding him to the ticket and found it had ""very, very little impact"" on the horserace numbers, Mr. Stewart said.""I suspect it would be the same this time,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton has long said her priority would be choosing a running mate who was prepared to be president. Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and a Clinton supporter, said Mr. Kaine likely was chosen primarily for the ""style and substance he brings to the table""--not because he could deliver a swing state.By selecting the Virginia senator, Mrs. Clinton also avoids a scenario where her choice could have consequences in the Senate, potentially tipping the balance of power. If Mrs. Clinton had tapped Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) as her running mate, Republican Gov. John Kasich would have chosen a replacement, presumably a Republican.Under Virginia law, Mr. Kaine would be temporarily replaced in the Senate by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally, and then the remainder of his term would be filled by the winner of a special election in November 2017.Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Laura Meckler",7/23/16

"In Battleground State, Voters Split on Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789135729?accountid=12768,"READING, Pa. -- In this city of shuttered factories and falling incomes, Donald Trump's swagger and promises to get tough with trading partners have rallied Republicans and shown signs of drawing working-class voters to the party.A short distance away, in the thriving office parks of Montgomery County, Republicans worry that those same qualities are repelling upper-income GOP voters.That's the tricky electoral math that Mr. Trump faces in an expected general-election push to win Pennsylvania and industrial Midwest states that haven't backed a Republican for president in decades.Mr. Trump's working-class appeal has helped add new Republicans to the voter rolls in the area around Reading, one of the nation's poorest cities. But in adjacent and more populous Montgomery County, Republicans fear Mr. Trump could amplify a recent tilt into the Democratic camp. Democrats there have made bigger gains than the GOP in voter registration.""That's the worry,"" said Art Bustard, a 61-year-old who owns a promotional-products business in Montgomery County. Mr. Trump, he says, ""is very popular with small-business men, contractors, machine-shop operators,"" but he must show ""the professional class that he's not going to hurt them.""Mr. Trump's appeal among Republicans is broad but is most intense among the white working-class. While those voters are plentiful in the Rust Belt, winning the region would be difficult.No Republican has carried Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin in a presidential election since the 1980s. President Barack Obama carried Michigan in 2012 by nearly 10 percentage points, Wisconsin by 7 and Pennsylvania by 5 points, or about 300,000 votes in that state. Ohio, where Republicans lost by 3 points, offered the region's only close contest.Visits to Blue Bell, in Montgomery County, and Reading, in Berks, show the test facing Mr. Trump. He won both counties in Pennsylvania's primary last month, but he carried lower-income Berks by 12 percentage points more.Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, easily won Montgomery County in the Democratic primary, by a margin of 18 percentage points over Sen. Bernie Sanders, while she lost Berks County by 2 points.Bonnie Stock, 66, a retired high-school math teacher who leads the Berks County GOP, says the excitement around Mr. Trump has been overwhelming.""Leading up to the primary, 98% of the calls I had were about Trump,"" she said. ""I would get up in the morning and start answering calls. For three days in a row, I didn't eat breakfast until 2 or 3 in the afternoon.""At a gathering of the county's GOP committee last week, many said they wanted their presumptive nominee to head into the general election with the bravado he displayed in the primary, though a few had reservations about comments some considered insulting to women.""I don't want him to tone it down,"" said Carla D'Addesi, 44, a radio talk-show host and mother of three, who said local voters were ""craving to make America great again.""Mr. Trump's demeanor, by contrast, is a potential hurdle in Montgomery, one of four counties in the state where he didn't break 50% in the primary. Josh Arnold, executive director of the county Republican committee, said he wants the New Yorker to end what he called ""the whole 'I'm willing to fight you on the playground' thing.""Montgomery County Republicans also said it was time for Mr. Trump to lay out a clearer governing agenda and to clarify his position on taxes, national security and trade.To temper his persona, ""he needs to pair it a little more with an articulation of policy,"" said Brian Gondek, 40, an attorney and restaurateur who is running for the state Senate.In Berks County, many Republicans said their enthusiasm for Mr. Trump wasn't driven by policy plans or white papers.""The policies, correctly, are at the end, after he goes through the process of everyone else being eliminated"" from the presidential race, said Ivan Torres, 68, a former community college professor.A Trump campaign representative didn't respond to a request for comment.Since November, Republicans in Berks have added 4,400 voters to the party's rolls, nearly twice the number Democrats have gained. And even some Democrats say they see signs that members of their party will flip to the GOP.But in Montgomery County, Democrats have added more voters -- more than 10,700 since November, versus about 7,100 additions to the GOP rolls.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist survey conducted last month found Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump by 15 percentage points among registered voters in the state. A Quinnipiac poll released last week found Mrs. Clinton ahead by a single point, 43% to 42%.National polling outlines the task ahead for Mr. Trump.In Wall Street Journal/NBC News surveys this year, Mr. Trump draws significantly more support among white men who lack a college degree than did the party's last nominee, Mitt Romney. But Mr. Trump underperforms Mr. Romney significantly among most other groups, especially among white voters with four-year college degrees.Of 15 people at the Berks County GOP meeting last week, seven had voted for Mr. Trump during the primary. Most of the others said they would back him in November.Richard Gromis, a 63-year-old financial adviser, warned that withholding a vote from Mr. Trump would help Mrs. Clinton.Eric Arnold, 48, a trucking-industry consultant, said he marveled that Mr. Trump won 65% of the primary vote in his neighborhood outside Reading.""The people in my precinct want someone who is going to go in there and blow it all up,"" he said.Credit: By Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni",7/25/16
Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: The Tea Party Eyes Donald Trump -- Warily,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789135431?accountid=12768,"Before The Donald was making political waves, there was the tea party doing the same. Now the question is whether these two wave-makers can come together.It won't be as easy as some think. Though the impulse behind the two movements is roughly the same -- bust up the political system, starting from within the Republican Party -- the differences are significant. The tea party is largely a movement of small-government, Constitution-loving conservatives. Donald Trump's Trumpism is largely a populist movement, led by a man whose conservative bona fides are questioned and who seems inclined to expansive presidential power in some areas.That leaves a gap, and tea-party activists are trying to figure out whether and how it might be closed. ""The thing about the Trump movement is it's about Trump,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, chairman of the Tea Party Patriots Citizen Fund. ""We're about principles.""The tea-party movement arose in 2009, initially as a response to government rescues of financial firms. Later it was fueled by opposition to the Affordable Care Act -- known as Obamacare -- and became a receptacle for antitax sentiment and general mistrust of government.Its main targets were President Barack Obama and his administration, but establishment Republicans became the casualties. Utah Sen. Robert Bennett, Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar and House Republican leader Eric Cantor all had their congressional careers ended by tea-party rivals who branded them as too meek.Dealing with this tea-party uprising became the principal preoccupation of Republican leaders -- until Mr. Trump came along and did in the presidential race what the tea-party movement had done in congressional contests.His willingness to thumb his nose at the party in which he was running tapped into a clear tea-party impulse. And his economic message to workers was similar: You are being shafted by the political and economic elites and it isn't your fault.""He speaks the tea-party language"" on the economy, said Mark Meckler, president of Citizens for Self Governance and founder of the Tea Party Patriots. ""Trump says it's a freakin' disaster. We know it's a disaster.""In fact, Ms. Martin guesses that Mr. Trump consciously tracked the anger identified by the tea party.""I think he looked out several years ago and saw the tea-party movement was tapping into this and he decided to tap into it as well,"" she said. ""Especially at the beginning of the last year, he said he was on the same side of the issues as the tea-party movement was.""That was particularly true, she said, when Mr. Trump talked about blocking immigrants at the Mexican border and denying amnesty to those already here illegally.But beyond the economy and the border, there are disconnects -- important ones -- ranging from the abstract to the practical.""Speaking personally, I've never heard him talk about the Constitution,"" said Mr. Meckler. ""We're constitutionalists.""The tea-party movement is suspicious of a powerful president, and Mr. Trump talks about using the presidency to force a variety of changes, on immigration policy, corporate decision-making and even libel law. ""He talks like it's going to be an imperial presidency,"" Mr. Meckler said. ""We already had an imperial presidency. And we don't like it.""Tea partiers also tend to be fierce deficit hawks, and Mr. Trump's declaration that he doesn't want to touch Medicare and Social Security benefits alarms some.There also is suspicion of his malleability on issues, Ms. Martin said. He has proposed a big tax-cut plan but has said its details are negotiable, and in recent days has sounded open to an increase in the minimum wage. He has hired as chief fundraiser a financier who used to work for Goldman Sachs, a hated symbol of big banks. ""A lot of people still want to see where he's going to come out on these issues,"" she said.The upshot is that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, not Mr. Trump, became the candidate for many in the tea-party movement. Ms. Martin's organization, in fact, conducted a straw poll of members earlier this year, and Mr. Cruz was the preferred choice on 70% of the roughly 50,000 ballots cast, she says.With Mr. Cruz gone from the race, Mr. Meckler guesses that tea-party enthusiasts today are split down the middle on whether or not to support Mr. Trump.The alternative for many likely isn't to support Democrat Hillary Clinton. So the biggest danger for Mr. Trump would be if they fall in line behind an independent conservative candidacy, if one emerges -- or simply don't vote.Mr. Meckler guesses that, in the end, 95% of tea-party supporters will, like him, become Trump backers: ""The question is how fast and with how much enthusiasm.That's where Trump has room to make gains.""Credit: By Gerald F.

Election 2016: Trump Fraud Case Delayed --- Appeals court rules GOP candidate can challenge a lawsuit over his former school,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789404839?accountid=12768,"A New York appeals court ruled Tuesday that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump can challenge a fraud case against him and his real-estate school before the state's highest court, a decision that makes it much more likely the case won't go to trial until after the November election.The unanimous ruling by a panel of judges represents a victory for Mr. Trump as he moves closer to locking down the Republican nomination. By adding another stage of litigation, Tuesday's decision could spare Mr. Trump a potential campaign disruption of a trial in which he could be called to testify.It could take a year or more for the New York State Court of Appeals to review key legal questions underpinning the state attorney general's case against Trump University.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's civil lawsuit, filed in 2013, alleges that Trump University exploited the billionaire businessman's celebrity status to lure people to enroll in pricey seminars on real-estate investing that failed to deliver on their promises. It claims that Trump University lacked proper licensing and defrauded thousands of students out of thousands of dollars each.Trump University, later rebranded the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, stopped accepting students in 2010, according to court documents.A separate and pending class-action suit in California against Mr. Trump, filed in 2010 by former students, also alleges that Trump University defrauded students. A trial date for that case has been set for shortly after the presidential election.Mr. Trump has denied the allegations in the suits, saying Trump University students got their money's worth. He also has accused Mr. Schneiderman of ""gross incompetence"" and of ""wasting millions in taxpayer money"" on what he called a politically motivated probe.A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Jeffrey L. Goldman, said he was ""extremely pleased"" to be given a chance to fight the lawsuit at the higher court.In the New York case, Mr. Goldman is challenging an earlier ruling that reinstated a fraud claim on jurisdictional and procedural grounds. A victory at the Court of Appeals wouldn't end the case but could limit the damages and blunt its political impact.""It's no surprise that Donald Trump is using every legal option to avoid standing trial for allegedly operating a sham for-profit university,"" Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement.A spokesman for the Court of Appeals said it typically takes a year for the court to hear arguments and issue an opinion after a case is added to its docket.Mr. Schneiderman could ask the Court of Appeals to move the case ahead of the line, but such requests are rarely made and granted, the spokesman said.A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said no decision has been made on whether to seek an expedited review.Credit: By Jacob Gershman",7/26/16
"Election 2016: Trump, RNC Reach Deal To Raise Money Jointly",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789404698?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee finalized a joint fundraising agreement late Tuesday that would allow individual donors to write checks of as much as $449,400 -- far higher than the $2,700 cap on what the presumptive GOP nominee's presidential campaign can accept.Under the agreement, Mr. Trump's campaign and the RNC will raise money for two joint fundraising committees. The first, called Trump Victory, will raise money for the RNC, the campaign and 11 state party committees.The second, called Trump Make America Great Again Committee, will direct funds only to the RNC and the Trump campaign.Mr. Trump said earlier this month that he would set up a joint fundraising committee and begin actively raising money for the general election, after largely self-funding his primary campaign. The general-election campaign is expected to cost more than $1 billion.Raising money jointly with the party allows Mr. Trump to fundraise more efficiently. Instead of finding a broader base of donors to write checks of up to $2,700, he can tap a smaller set of wealthy donors for larger checks. But the joint fundraising committees are also limited in what they can transfer to his campaign and spend on his behalf.Mr. Trump's likely general-election rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, has had a formidable fundraising operation in place for more than a year. She raised more than $213 million for her campaign through the end of April, on top of more than $67 million raised by her allied super PACs.""We are pleased to have this partnership in place with the national party,"" Mr. Trump said in a statement.Donors will only be able to write checks of up to $449,400 to Trump Victory -- the sum of the contribution caps for each committee included in the fund.In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney's joint fundraising committee with the RNC could accept checks of up to $75,800 per person.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",7/26/16
Unhedged: Investors Should Take Trump More Seriously,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789355804?accountid=12768,"Even when he took the lead in the Republican race late last summer, Donald Trump remained a joke on Wall Street.Maybe it was his bluster or maybe it was his financial ups and downs over the years, but the financial world finds it hard to swallow the fact that he is a serious candidate for president.Investors, wrote market strategist Jason Trennert last August, needed to take Mr. Trump more seriously.""Trump is hitting new highs, large institutional investors are underweight in their positioning, and the shorts are finding it hard to borrow the stock,"" wrote Mr. Trennert, comparing the candidate to an out-of-favor stock that has caught fire. ""In essence, all the 'experts' are saying the 'market' is wrong.""Mr. Trennert, the chairman and chief executive of Strategas Research Partners LLC, believes Wall Street is missing the surge of discontent among voters that has propelled Mr. Trump. ""It may be the best call of my career,"" said Mr. Trennert, who started on Wall Street 26 years ago.Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive and chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital, predicted a Trump victory in January, also saying Wall Street was out of touch. ""The people who like to opine on these things, they don't watch 'The Apprentice.' They're streaming 'Breaking Bad' on Netflix,"" he said. ""A lot of people in this country still watch regular TV, and they are watching 'The Apprentice.'""Most professional investors still don't believe, and don't want to believe, that Mr. Trump can win. Strategas surveyed 650 clients, all institutional investors, on March 17 and April 27. In the first poll, 66% of clients said Hillary Clinton would win and in the next survey, the number rose to 69%. Even as Mr. Trump effectively seized the Republican Party nomination, the share of respondents who thought he would win the presidency fell from 27% to 22%.The investors give Mr. Trump a lower chance of victory than prediction markets, which put his chances at 29% and Mrs. Clinton's at 71%, according to PredictWise.Polls compiled by Real Clear Politics put the popular vote at 47.3% to 41.6% in favor of Mrs. Clinton.Even if the market took Mr. Trump more seriously, it isn't entirely clear what investors should do if they believe the Republican can win. Or what they should do differently than if they think Mrs. Clinton will win.Both candidates are expected to borrow money to boost government spending -- if they can get Congress to go along. One reason is that tax cuts scheduled for 2017 were pulled forward to this year, meaning there will be less stimulus in 2017. Mr. Trump would probably also borrow more to fund the wall he has said he will build along the Mexican border.That presents a conundrum for investors. The spending boost would juice the economy and corporate earnings, although it could ultimately leave the country deeper in debt. Professional money managers can't risk being left behind when the market rallies, even if they think it will end badly. That could lead to bigger gains now, and bigger losses later.Firms including Strategas have come up with portfolios for each potential election outcome. Two areas in which forecasters see the same trend, regardless of which candidate wins: Infrastructure companies do well as the government boosts spending and drug companies struggle as officials look to cut costs for benefits.It is hard to tell, but few investors seem to be lining up bets for the election. If the government was going to borrow more, Treasury yields should go up, but they are still near rock-bottom.It makes sense that investors haven't started trading on the election yet; a lot can happen in six months. And before the vote, investors will have to deal with the Brexit vote in Europe, possible Fed rate increases and the always possible chance that China roils markets again.The market should start to react in the fall. Despite Mr. Trump's desire, yields on government bonds will likely rise. Inflation has picked up, and should get an added boost from higher wages. Just as important, almost half of outstanding U.S. debt matures in the next three years and the weighted average interest rate is a low 2%, according to Strategas, meaning the Treasury will have a lot of debt to sell, potentially at a higher yield.Maybe more important than what investors do is what the Fed is likely to do after the election. If the economy is humming thanks to government stimulus, it could raise rates. Higher tariffs under a more protectionist Trump administration could also boost inflation, prompting the Fed to tight-en. But if Mr. Trump imposed new trade restrictions that cut global growth, then the Fed, which has been concerned with overseas markets, could do the opposite.Mr. Trennert, a longtime Republican who has a picture of Ronald Reagan on his desk, said investors remain unprepared for a President Trump. In two days of client meetings in Boston last week, Mr. Trennert got just one question about how a Trump victory could benefit the stock market.Maybe investors are avoiding the issue because it is impossible to fit Trump into any logical investment model, says David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Corp. who also runs PredictWise. ""He is the definition of idiosyncratic information.""Enlarge this image.Credit: By Ken Brown",7/26/16

Election 2016: Trump Details His Income --- New disclosure form shows increase from licensing but a drop from menswear line,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789697194?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's income from licensing his name to overseas companies has continued to rise since he announced his candidacy for president, his latest federal financial-disclosure form shows.But the Republican has earned less from some other sources since announcing his White House bid in June 2015, according to an analysis of his Federal Election Commission filing. For example, he no longer makes paid public appearances. Also, the disparaging remarks that he made about Mexican immigrants last year had an impact on his beauty pageant and menswear line.Mr. Trump's ready cash may have declined, according to the form, which was made public Wednesday. He has between about $61 million and $173 million in stocks, bonds, cash and other relatively liquid holdings. Last July, he reported he had between $78 million and $232 million in such assets.This decline might help explain why Mr. Trump decided to start raising large campaign donations after emphasizing throughout the primary season that he was self-financing and, therefore, he said, not beholden to special interests like other candidates. Mr. Trump loaned his campaign $36 million through the end of March and had also taken in $12 million from individual donors.Overall, the disclosure form doesn't answer the question of how much Mr. Trump is worth because it was designed by the Office of Government Ethics to guard against conflicts of interest and not precisely state a candidate's income or wealth.But it does provide a revealing snapshot of the billionaire's sprawling operations -- including real estate, golf courses, licensing deals and management businesses -- as he looks forward to what is expected to be a bruising battle against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner. The financial demands already have started to ratchet up, with Mr. Trump's campaign spending about 50% more in March than in February.A Wall Street Journal analysis, published this week, of the financial disclosure form that Mr. Trump filed last July found that he wouldn't have had the ready cash from his businesses to continue self-financing through November. If he wanted to stay on this route, he would have had to sell assets or take on more leverage, the analysis found.The Journal's analysis estimated Mr. Trump's 2016 pretax income at $160 million. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign said this figure was wrong by ""a lot.""According to the latest form, the value of some of Mr. Trump's stockholdings has declined. For example, he held between $2.35 million and $7.75 million of Apple Inc. shares last July; he now holds between $1.1 million and $2.25 million. It isn't clear how much of the change was due to his selling and how much was due to the stock's price decline.Meanwhile, the money coming from Mr. Trump's income-producing businesses has increased. In his July form, he listed 170 different assets in the section of the form labeled ""employment assets and income"" with a minimum revenue of $419.6 million.This year, he listed 152 assets, with minimum revenue increasing to $615 million. Part of this came from his golf-course business, which saw $306 million in revenue, up from $192.5 million reported in his July filing.Also, he received royalty payments of $11.3 million from 29 sources, up from $9.4 million from 24 sources. Part of this came from his deal with the Trump International Golf Club in Dubai, which produced $1 million to $5 million in royalties, according to the latest form, up from the less than $201 reported in July.Reasons for the increase in total revenue also included proceeds from the sale of his Miss Universe beauty pageant for about $49.3 million. He took that step last year after Univision Communications Inc. canceled plans to air it, citing his remarks about Mexicans.The campaign has cut into some of Mr. Trump's other businesses, according to the latest disclosure. For example, he listed only four speaking engagements, for a total of $800,000, with all of them taking place before he announced his candidacy. His previous form listed seven engagements for $1.75 million.The disclosure form filed last July covers 2014 through July 2015; his latest form covers 2015 through this month. As a result, some transactions, such as speaking engagements, are covered by both forms.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's menswear line apparently was hurt by Macy's Inc.'s decision to stop carrying it, also citing his Mexican remarks. The line brought in $100,000 to $1 million in royalties, according to the filing. Last July, he reported the menswear line brought in $1 million to $5 million in royalties.At the same time, Mr. Trump's royalty business has grown, particularly the licensing of his name to foreign companies. For example, in September, Trump Hotels announced a deal with a new ultraluxury resort in Indonesia. His latest disclosure reports $1 million to $5 million in royalty income from this agreement.---Richard Rubin contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Grant and Andrea Fuller",7/27/16
Trump and Bernie: Less Is More,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789696545?accountid=12768,"If you did a word-association game with people for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it might go like this:Donald Trump: wall, trade, terrific.Bernie Sanders: billionaires, Wall Street, income inequality.With these words, Donald Trump, the host of ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" defeated a platoon of professional Republican politicians and is the party's presumptive nominee.Bernie Sanders, a Vermont socialist, won't be the Democrats' nominee but he has transformed Hillary Clinton into the incredible shrinking heir apparent.As a result, some have asked: What is going on with the American electorate? A follow-up question would be: How have Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders gone so far by offering so little?Everyone gets that these two campaigns are about varieties of anger. But something other than anger is changing America's politics.At the Trump campaign website, five policy positions are listed. Two are ""Pay for the Wall"" and ""Immigration."" Other than trade with China, there is no entry on foreign policy.Sen. Sanders's campaign is essentially variations on several evocative phrases. Liberal analysts have debunked what little detail he has proposed as implausible, notably on health care.And still: political minimalism is a winner in 2016.After meeting with Mr. Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan said, ""Going forward, we're going to go a little deeper in the policy weeds.""But Donald Trump probably thinks weeds are something he hires a gardener to do. Mr. Trump himself said last summer that the details would come ""over the next two or three weeks -- probably sometime during September. OK?"" They didn't come.Could it be that these two have read the electorate's zeitgeist correctly? They, especially Mr. Trump, understand that the vapors shaping public sentiment -- and ""sentiment"" is the word -- have shifted decisively away from a past built, for the most part, on substance and logic.My apologies to the Trump and Sanders supporters who have their support analyzed out to the third decimal point. But not everyone does, nor wants to anymore.Professional politics itself has been transitioning toward more emotive metrics. The most important candidate tests now are ""cares about people like me"" or ""tells it like it is.""All of Mr. Trump's main opponents -- Messrs. Bush, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich -- were policy wonks. For them, what mattered was hands-on political experience. But the kind of experience in vogue now is more like the elation from attending a mass rally.The Trump-Sanders policy pitch resembles a Rorschach test. They let voters read meanings of their own into immigration, make America great again and the billionaire class. Their rhetoric-only campaigns flip the switch for the already wired.Hillary has tried to be a more rational alternative to Bernie the way all the Republican candidates did with Donald Trump. She's getting hurt for the same reason: At least half the electorate this year isn't into hearing how much she knows about policy.Mrs. Clinton's campaign said this week she planned to call out Mr. Trump on his lack of detail and his contradictions. She might want to consult Aristophanes' ancient Greek comedy ""The Clouds,"" a satire of politicians who overthink.This isn't quite the death of reason, though Stanford's Russ Roberts noted in these pages recently how economists increasingly factor feelings about politics into objective data.How did this happen? My lodestar on these matters is Marshall McLuhan, who wrote presciently in 1967: ""All media works us over completely."" It would be foolish not to recognize that the environment we swim in daily alters everything, not least politics.In the digital world enveloping us now, all you have to know is how to work the interface. Click, and software does the heavy thinking and detail work. Messrs. Trump and Sanders are more in sync with the culture many are most comfortable with.A typical Trump conversation makes minimal linear sense. But most big superhero movies today make no sense either. They're just a lot of quick spurts, jumbled points of view and over-the-top caricatures. Like Donald Trump.Ever notice that quick, ironic Trumpian smile amid his rants? He knows his audience -- half serious, half hoot. It works. At the Nevada caucuses last weekend, the Sanders supporters swung from glee to violence. ""Feel the Bern"" is a sensation.The Trump and Sanders phenomena really have more in common with Facebook communities than with the two political parties. Maybe that's the future. Criticizing them, we've all learned, violates the social bond.There have to be professional Democrats who wish they could roll Bernie's new magic voter dice against Donald Trump's this fall.Of course we can't govern this way. The Trump and Sanders electorates are right in their anger about poor wage growth, but it's still going to be a mistake if the next president, elevated out of a culture of sentiment, is incapable of policy execution.This is a presidential campaign for our time. What comes after, the world and its many realities, will still be old school.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",7/27/16
Trump's Income not enough to self-fund --- Analysis suggests he would lack ready cash to finance entire campaign,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789006238?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, after long saying his self-financed campaign shielded him from special interests, is preparing to start raising large donations. He reversed course, he said in early May, to ensure his campaign has the resources to compete with Hillary Clinton.It might seem a strange reason for a man who says he is worth $10 billion. But a close analysis of Mr. Trump's finances shows that in terms of ready cash, he would be ill-equipped to foot the bill himself.When his campaign began last summer, a financial disclosure Mr. Trump filed said he had between about $78 million and $232 million in cash and relatively liquid assets such as stocks and bonds.That would go fast if Mr. Trump spent an amount close to the $721 million President Barack Obama spent in 2012 up to Election Day, or the $449 million Mitt Romney spent in the same stretch.This would leave hundreds of millions to be made up. And Mr. Trump's businesses don't produce that much in a year, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows. His 2016 pretax income, according to the analysis, is likely to be around $160 million.The result is if Mr. Trump stuck with self-financing, he likely would have faced difficult decisions over whether to sell some of his properties or borrow more money against them.The Journal analysis is based on 170 items of ""employment assets and income,"" such as real estate, golf courses, management companies and licensing deals, listed in the financial disclosure form Mr. Trump filed last July. The Journal estimated how much pretax income each item should yield this year, relying on public documents and interviews with dozens of former and current Trump Organization executives and people who are familiar with his businesses.In the absence of Mr. Trump's tax returns, which he has declined to release, the analysis helps answer a question many wonder about: just how much the candidate earns.Asked about the analysis, Trump aides didn't comment in detail. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, ""The income number is wrong by a lot, but Mr. Trump said, 'Who cares -- it doesn't matter.'""Earlier, in a March interview, Mr. Trump said he could raise ""billions"" by putting additional debt on his assets but wasn't eager to because he had grown more conservative about debt in recent years.""I don't want to do that,"" he said. ""But after the primary season, I'll say, 'What will it take? What will I need if I want to do it that way?' ""The cash issue looms now because the political season is growing more expensive. The Trump campaign spent about 50% more in March than in February, facing higher expenses for field workers, telemarketing and voter-data operations.Mr. Trump noted that once the general election campaign begins, the Republican National Committee will spend heavily on his behalf. The RNC spent $386 million during the 2012 presidential campaign. A clutch of other entities such as political-action committees spent $419 million to back Mr. Romney.This year, officials at some big GOP PACs are saying they are going to turn their funds toward keeping the Senate and House in the Republican hands, meaning their support for Mr. Trump could be diminished.On the other hand, legal changes since 2012 make it possible for political parties to raise larger individual donations, via joint fundraisingcommittees with their presidential candidates. Such a joint fundraising committee is what Mr. Trump said in early May that he planned to set up with the Republican Party.The main purpose of financial disclosures such as the one Mr. Trump released last July is alerting the public to potential conflicts of interests, not showing how much candidates earn or are worth. Even so, the document filed with the Office of Government Ethics provides a good starting point for figuring out Mr. Trump's income.The disclosure covers all of 2014 plus the portion of 2015 up to when it was filed on July 15. For each of 170 assets or businesses, it shows how much they provided over those 181/2 months in rent, royalties, condo sales or fees.The disclosure form calls these amounts ""income"" from the assets, even though Mr. Trump filled in the form with revenue figures. It appears this was valid because federal regulations effectively allow candidates to report revenue for some types of businesses.Revenue is only part of the picture, of course; salaries, overhead, debt service and other expenses cut into it. Mr. Trump called those negligible. ""We have expenses coming out, but very little,"" he said.The form lists certain revenue sources that have little expense, such as seven speaking engagements that produced $1.75 million in revenue over 18 1/2 months and 14 management businesses that produced $17.6 million in fees. Operations such as managing hotels can have profit margins as high as 80%, owners of such businesses say.For other Trump assets, however, expenses such as interest would cut significantly into reported revenue.Mr. Trump's disclosure lists 15 loans, usually showing the amount borrowed in a range, such as $5 million to $25 million. Four loans are listed as ""over $50 million.""The Journal determined the original amounts of the loans through public documents. They totaled more than $630 million. To gauge expenses, the Journal in some cases found public documents identifying the amounts.Public loan documents were filed when Mr. Trump refinanced his office tower at 40 Wall Street last year through the sale of commercial mortgage-backed securities, and when he did the same in 2012 with the commercial space in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.In the case of 40 Wall, the annual revenue was $43.2 million and annual expenses came to $20.6 million, not counting interest, according to underwriter calculations provided by research firm Trepp LLC. The documents also show annual debt service is about $9.7 million.The result is that the income to Mr. Trump from 40 Wall, before taxes, would be about $12.8 millionthis year.Mr. Trump's other leading assets include 30% stakes in buildings at 1290 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco. His annual pretax income from the two is roughly $22.7 million, according to a financial-services firm's analysis of filings by the properties' controlling shareholder, Vornado Realty Trust.When documents weren't available for Trump businesses, the Journal interviewed current and former employees and others with direct knowledge of the businesses.When neither documents nor people with direct knowledge of the businesses were available, the Journal spoke to industry experts, who provided expense estimates or likely profit margins applicable to various Trump businesses, from modeling agencies to golf courses. The Journal typically used a figure in the upper end of the ranges when estimating the cash flow.Mr. Trump's 16 golf courses were the source of about $200 million of the revenue he reported on last summer's disclosure, for the 18 1/2 months.Three of the golf courses must make public disclosures. They haven't been doing especially well, according to their latest available reports.Trump Turnberry in Scotland, purchased in 2014, lost GBP 3.6 million ($5.2 million) that year, according to a filing with the Scottish government. Most of it is closed for an upgrade and due to reopen in June.Another Trump golf course in Scotland and one in Ireland also lost money in 2014.Mr. Trump's other 13 golf courses don't report publicly. Specialists on the golf business said the best courses in the world operate with 20% to 35% profit margins. The Journal used a 27.5% margin to estimate Mr. Trump's pretax income from these 13.In a few cases, Mr. Trump will have no income from listed businesses because he is no longer in them. For example, he sold his Miss Universe pageant in 2015 after Univision Communications Inc. canceled plans to air it, citing disparaging remarks the candidate made about Mexican illegal immigrants.Mr. Trump's disclosure listed $43.3 million from sales of condos at Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago over the 18 1/2 months covered. That won't recur because the condos are sold out, according to Chicago brokers.All told, Mr. Trump's 54 most productive businesses -- those with more than $1 million of revenue in the 18 1/2-month period -- will produce about $147 million of 2016 pretax income, according to the Journal calculation. The Journal estimated that 116 assets listed with revenue of from zero to $1 million will throw off about $13 million.Total: about $160 million of 2016 income, before taxes.Mr. Trump said the Journal's analysis doesn't take into account other sources of income he has, such as 114 licensing deals the Trump Organization is negotiating ""all over the world,"" which he said would generate ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in cash flow. ""I'm not allowed to reveal them because I have partnerships with other people in other countries,"" he said.A Trump aide also said the Journal analysis didn't include cash held by Mr. Trump's various properties.Owners of commercial real estate, golf courses and other income-producing assets like Mr. Trump's generally don't hold on to much surplus cash at the property level, instead sending it ""upstream"" to the owners, said accountants and executives familiar with Mr. Trump's businesses.If Mr. Trump wanted to borrow to help pay for his campaign, he could face various costs and complications entailed in raising real-estate debt. He has grown shy of taking on heavy debt, having had a close call about 25 years ago when he was in danger of personal bankruptcy. ""I know it could have gone a different way,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview. ""I've become very much more conservative.""Selling properties to help pay for his campaign would create its own complications. To sell commercial real estate can take months, and getting top dollar is difficult if buyers know the seller wants the money quickly.Selling assets also would put to the test the valuations Mr. Trump has placed on his empire. The July 2015 disclosure form isn't precise about asset values. It lists the biggest assets as simply worth $50 million or more. Adding up the values listed produces a low-end figure of $1.35 billion for Mr. Trump's assets. It doesn't show a maximum. A news release last July said, ""As of this date, Mr. Trump's net worth is in excess of ten billion dollars.""---Andrea Fuller and Kate O'Keeffe contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Grant and Brody Mullins",7/27/16
Clinton Aide Needles Trump on Strategy; Campaign manager challenges Trump's claim he could be competitive in Democratic strongholds,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807220526?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Hillary Clinton's campaign manager on Wednesday challenged Donald Trump's claim that he could be competitive in Democratic strongholds, urging the Republican nominee to stump in traditionally blue states.Robby Mook joked that he stands ready to help Mr. Trump forge a game plan for competing in northeastern states where Republicans have long struggled.""I absolutely encourage Donald Trump to spend time campaigning in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey,"" Mr. Mook said at a lunch hosted by The Wall Street Journal during the Democratic National Convention.Mr. Trump repeatedly has asserted that he will expand the traditional battleground and carve a path to the White House by winning states where Republican presidential candidates rarely compete. The New York businessman has said his home state could be in play in the November election. And he has called New Jersey a second home, saying that he expects to do well there.Mr. Mook appeared to give such claims little credence, quipping that the Clinton team would help the GOP nominee develop an itinerary for campaigning in those states.""My staff is at his disposal,"" Mr. Mook said.In response, Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, said: ""Sun Tzu once said that overconfidence creates situations where you will be defeated by the unexpected. The Clinton campaign would be wise to take this to heart when facing a national grass-roots movement looking to break up the rigged system in Washington and elect a true outsider like Donald Trump.""For his part, the Clinton campaign manager identified North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Florida as key battlegrounds in this election, sketching plans for appealing to distinctly different voter groups in each state.Some political pundits have suggested that Georgia, which has backed Republican presidential candidates in the last five presidential elections, could be more competitive in this election.But Mr. Mook shied from any bold predictions.""Georgia is going to be a battleground state,"" he said. ""It's just a question of when.""Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.comCredit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",7/28/16
"Chelsea Clinton Set to Make Her Case for Her Mother; Like Ivanka Trump a week earlier, the would-be first daughter will introduce the nominee",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807168464?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--A day before Chelsea Clinton was to address the Democratic convention, she stepped away from the convention hall on Wednesday to rail against what she called Donald Trump's ""divisive"" and ""degrading"" rhetoric.Ms. Clinton faces the unprecedented task of preparing for the prospect of becoming the first daughter for a second time. In recent years, the Clintons' only daughter has become increasingly involved in the family businesses--politics and the Clinton Foundation. In 2008, she hit the campaign trail for her mother's failed bid to win the Democratic nomination. She has been back on the stump for her mother since last year.Ms. Clinton on Thursday will introduce her mother at the convention, before the nominee's acceptance speech. Her friend Ivanka Trump did the same for Donald Trump at last week's GOP convention, promoting her father's candidacy, committing him to some progressive stances on women's issues and never mentioning the Democratic nominee by name.But unlike Ms. Trump, who is active in managing her father's properties, Ms. Clinton's future beyond this campaign is less clear. In 2011, Ms. Clinton joined the foundation created by her father, Bill, when he left the White House, but the foundation's prospects under a Clinton White House remain unknown.In June, Mr. Clinton acknowledged the political reality that should his wife be elected president, the foundation would have to make changes about fundraising and mission. About the same time, a senior Clinton campaign adviser told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. Clinton wouldn't be able to continue to raise money for the foundation.The adviser added that if Mrs. Clinton is in the White House, the foundation couldn't function as it did when she served as secretary of state.People close to the Clintons said they could see Ms. Clinton, should her mother be elected, taking on some of the roles traditionally reserved for the first lady, such as organizing holiday parties and selecting menus for state dinners.Ms. Clinton has been outspoken on the campaign trail in recent months. Speaking at an event Wednesday hosted by the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights advocacy group, Ms. Clinton criticized the Republican Party platform, finalized at last week's convention, which she called the ""most regressive, least inclusive platform in modern political history.""""I thought a lot about what I found most offensive last week,"" she said. ""It's hard to pick just one part.""Calling the election the ""most important"" of her lifetime as the first in which she will cast her vote as a mother, Ms. Clinton, 36 years old, said Wednesday that her mother provides a ""stark contrast"" to the gay-rights stances of Mr. Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.The Republican platform opposes same-sex marriage and supports parents' right to consent to medical treatment on behalf of their children. Gay-rights advocates read that as a tacit endorsement of conversion therapy, a practice intended to stop gay people from being gay. Ms. Clinton on Wednesday likened conversion therapy to ""child abuse"" and said her mother would federally ban the practice.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, asked in an Associated Press interview whether the GOP supported that practice, replied, ""It's not in the platform.""Ms. Clinton, who has degrees from Stanford, Oxford and Columbia, has benefited from her family connections. She worked for a time at Avenue Capital, an investment firm run by Marc Lasry, a close Clinton friend. She is a paid board director of IAC/InterActiveCorp., the media company run by Barry Diller, a longtime friend of the Clintons.Ms. Clinton's husband, Marc Mezvinsky, operates a hedge fund, and several of the top investors have been longtime friends and supporters of the Clintons and their foundation.She has also seen other personal relationships complicated by politics--including her friendship with Ms. Trump. At an event here on Tuesday, Ms. Clinton was asked about Ms. Trump's speech assertion that her father would back ""equal pay"" for women--a subject he has rarely discussed.Ms. Clinton said she is dubious about Mr. Trump's commitment to the issue ""given it's not something that he has spoken about, [and] there are no policies on any of those fronts that you just mentioned on his website."" She added: ""So I think the 'how' question is super important.""Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comCredit: By Rebecca Ballhaus and James V. Grimaldi",7/28/16
"Trump, Sanders and the Populist Anti-Policy Surge",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789939870?accountid=12768,"If there's one thing that unites the populist campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it's a desire to put the ""public"" back into ""public policy."" Many Americans apparently feel that policy is something done to them, rather than with them. They disdain the unknown ""experts"" in distant Washington, D.C., who devise everything from trade deals to overtime rules.As the dean of a graduate school in public policy, I've been thinking: Are programs like mine partly responsible for this state of affairs? How should graduates in the Class of 2016 react as they enter a world increasingly skeptical of their expertise?It's true that government has often failed to engage citizens. During a recent conference on land use at Pepperdine, the planning director of a large California city explained it this way: ""The problem is that we always put people up in front of the public who are the least prepared to be there.""Her staff were experts in the technical aspects of their work -- from limits on building heights to requirements for setbacks. But she recognized that when her planners met with citizens, who often had different priorities, they were incapable of facilitating productive dialogue. The public simply concluded that the government couldn't -- or wouldn't -- ""listen.""Graduate programs in public policy and public administration have wrestled with this for years. The discipline sends into the field alumni who may be very good at formulating something called ""policy,"" but not so good at understanding the public's role in its creation. ""Large segments of mainstream public administration scholarship,"" Robert F. Durant and Susannah Bruns Ali wrote three years ago in Public Administration Review, ""privilege bureaucratic expertise and marginalize the deliberative role of unorganized interests and citizens in agency deliberations.""The general tendencies of these academic programs toward quantitative knowledge and standardized solutions has created what we see today: from local planners who don't listen, to White House advisers who believe that ObamaCare passed because of the ""stupidity of the American voter.""At Pepperdine, we host a training series titled ""Public Engagement: The Vital Leadership Skill."" More than 1,000 public officials have taken part, learning the basics of facilitating input from citizens. We developed the program about five years ago after realizing that many midcareer public leaders never learned these skills in college and graduate school.Are this generation's successors being taught them? The retirement of the baby boomers will effect one of the greatest changes in public leadership in American history. Now is the time to update these programs to ensure that generational change becomes cultural change.First, we should teach students to think of the public not as a faceless mass, but as actual, individual human beings. ""Modern public administration,"" the great sociologist Robert Nisbet wrote, ""has been generally dominated by the nineteenth-century rationalist's conception of society as a vast aggregate of unconnected political particles."" That was in 1953.Public-policy programs should integrate essential quantitative coursework into a liberal-arts approach. Students should read what the Great Books say about the role of a citizen in a democracy, while studying what the latest social-psychology research shows about the myriad biases people bring to ""fact based"" decision-making. These will help them see that the policy they develop for Rome, Ga., may not work in Rome, N.Y., (or Rome, Italy, for that matter) and that some government services might be better provided by a local nonprofit or through collaboration with the private sector.Second, schools must teach a set of skills -- how to facilitate public meetings or publicize them to increase participation. The ""public comment"" process by which local boards and councils usually involve citizens does not succeed at informing either the public or policy makers. In 2013 Pepperdine, working with the League of California Cities, surveyed over 900 public officials. Seventy-six percent said that their public meetings were ""typically dominated by people with narrow agendas.""It's the same phenomenon that played out in the conflagrations known as town halls when ObamaCare was being passed. Citizens came out in force against the bill, but Congress passed it anyway. Some argue that these failed public meetings led to the creation of America's last populist movement: the tea party.Finally, students of public policy should be taught about the role of technology in mediating the relationship between the citizen and his government. A couple of months ago, my hometown of Santa Monica invited me via Facebook to complete an online survey regarding a downtown building project. Tomorrow's public leaders must be prepared to involve and inform residents in ways the private sector has employed for decades -- engaging them on social media, or posting budget data online to increase transparency.In the months ahead, thousands of future leaders will be awarded degrees in public policy. Meanwhile, graduate schools should ponder the role they play in American democracy -- and how they can respond to the populist moment that is upending politics (and policy) as usual.---Mr. Peterson is the dean of the Pepperdine School of Public Policy.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Populist Anti-Policy Surge Has Deep Roots"" -- WSJ May 26, 2016)Credit: By Pete Peterson",7/28/16
Donald Trump's Day in Court,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789939864?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump took an unusual step for a presumptive presidential nominee on Wednesday by naming 11 potential Supreme Court candidates -- and the list shows that someone is giving him sound judicial advice. One obvious worry about Mr. Trump is that he has given voters no clear idea of how he would govern, so offering some specific pre-election guidance is good politics that could lead to better judicial choices.Mr. Trump said in March that he'd release a list of Supreme Court candidates that he will ""100% pick, that I will put in for nomination."" On Wednesday he offered a generally impressive roster of six judges sitting on federal courts and five from state Supreme Courts. The latter is a healthy bow to the nation's ""vast expanse in-between,"" as the late Justice Antonin Scalia put it in 2014 when he noted that nearly all recent Justices have been coastal lawyers from Harvard or Yale.One promising choice is the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals' Diane Sykes, who also served on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and wrote an opinion in 2014 that declared ""labryinthian"" regulation on political speech unconstitutional. Another is the Sixth Circuit's Raymond Kethledge, who in March rebuked the IRS for obstructing a lawsuit on the agency's targeting of conservative groups, a matter he called ""among the most serious allegations a federal court can address.""The lineup is clearly intended to bring along social conservatives who have been leery of Mr. Trump: Several have a paper trail defending religious liberty, restrictions on abortion, or vouchers for parochial schools. Steven Colloton is a highly regarded judge from the Eighth Circuit who clerked for former Chief Justice William Rehnquist and joined an opinion supporting a religious exception to ObamaCare's contraception mandate. First and Second Amendment cases are another common theme of their jurisprudence.Mr. Trump tweeted Wednesday that he might be ""adding"" to the list, and if he does we'd include the D.C. Circuit's Brett Kavanaugh and the Sixth Circuit's Jeff Sutton. Both are powerful minds who could replace some of the conservative intellectual heft that the Court has lost in Justice Scalia.Some conservatives say the names are irrelevant because Mr. Trump changes his mind on everything, but such a public list raises the political cost if he picks an unknown or a crony. His list includes some of the more solid constitutional originalists in the country, which suggests interest in unifying the GOP. A Republican Senate could hold him to his own standard if he goes rogue, much as it did George W. Bush when he nominated Harriet Miers.The bitter history is that voters have never been sure who GOP Presidents would nominate to the High Court. The Presidents who appointed the great Clarence Thomas and Scalia -- George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan -- also picked David Souter and Sandra Day O'Connor, who tacked left once they joined the Court. Our main concern would be whether Mr. Trump would stick to his list if Republicans lost the Senate and he turned to the ""art of the deal"" with Chuck Schumer.Nothing is certain with Mr. Trump, but that's far preferable to the certainty that Hillary Clinton would nominate a down-the-line liberal. The direction of the Supreme Court for a generation is up for grabs in November, and Mr. Trump's list makes him far superior to Mrs. Clinton on that score.",7/28/16
Election 2016: Trump Looks to NRA for Boost --- Republican to address gun group that Clinton has called an enemy she is proud to have,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789939851?accountid=12768,"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is banking on one of the GOP's most faithful constituencies -- gun owners -- as he tries to rally a party fractured by his candidacy.He will address a convention on Friday hosted by the political arm of the National Rifle Association, expected to draw tens of thousands of people to Louisville, Ky.Guns represent one of the sharpest policy contrasts between him and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Mrs. Clinton has put gun control near the top of her agenda and has shifted to the left on the issue while fighting off a challenge from the liberal wing of the party.Mr. Trump has significantly changed his position on gun policy over the years. In 2000, he backed an assault-weapons ban and longer waiting periods for gun purchases, but he has retreated from those positions during this campaign. He also has vowed to do away with gun-free school zones and backs a top NRA priority: allowing permits to carry concealed weapons in one state to be valid in another.In the eyes of many gun enthusiasts, Mr. Trump's reversals on assault weapons and gun-sales checks are small quibbles compared with Mrs. Clinton's campaign to ""take on"" the gun lobby.Mrs. Clinton named the NRA -- along with the insurance and drug industries, the Iranians and the Republican Party -- as the enemies she is most proud of during a debate last year. She hailed President Barack Obama's executive orders aimed at expanding and improving background checks, which Mr. Trump says he would do away with.""We're looking at what people would do as president, and Donald Trump has laid out positions that show a strong commitment to Second Amendment rights,"" said Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman.""This should be a very friendly audience for him.""Mrs. Baker added, ""When it comes to motivating our members and turning them out and getting them to vote against Hillary, it will be easy.""Activists on both sides of the debate are seeking to frame the November vote as a referendum on guns. In a twist on Mr. Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety is promoting ""Make America Safe Again"" during the NRA convention.Mr. Trump's opposition to gun control could make it harder for him to improve his standing with two slices of the electorate that could tip the scales in the November election: women and minorities. In a Wall Journal/NBC News poll in December, majorities of female, African-American and Hispanic voters said they were concerned the government wouldn't do enough to regulate firearms, while most men and white voters were more concerned that the government would go too far in restricting gun rights.On the other hand, Mr. Trump's positions could help him in pro-gun states carried by Mr. Obama, including Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado and New Hampshire.Guns didn't come up much in the Republican primary, but received a lot of attention in the Democratic race, as Mrs. Clinton repeatedly attacked rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for voting for a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from most lawsuits. Mr. Sanders has defended his vote, but also co-sponsored a bill to repeal the law this year.As Mr. Sanders tried to lock down the liberal wing of the party, gun control was one of the only issues on which Mrs. Clinton could attack him from the left. Mrs. Clinton also has campaigned with African-American mothers who lost children to gun violence, as part of her support for the BlackLivesMatter movement.Mrs. Clinton's emphasis and tone have differed considerably from her 2008 campaign, when she shared memories of learning how to shoot a gun as a child and criticized then-Sen. Obama for suggesting some Pennsylvania voters ""cling to guns and religion."" In past elections, Democrats have tended to be cautious about offending gun owners.""We've been encouraged by the total sea change in how guns have been addressed in this election cycle,"" said Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety. ""What was once considered a third-rail issue is now front and center.""Mr. Trump's speech will be closely watched for signs he was serious when he said while campaigning in January in Vermont: ""I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools . . . . My first day, it gets signed, OK?""Mr. Trump would need Congress to repeal a 1990 federal law signed by former Republican President George H.W. Bush that forbids firearms near school grounds. Mr. Trump's campaign website, however, doesn't mention gun-free school zones in the gun policy section.A Trump campaign spokeswoman declined to comment.Credit: By Beth Reinhard",7/28/16
Obama Front-Runs Trump on China,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789939818?accountid=12768,"The Obama Administration may not sound like Donald Trump when talking about trade with China, but it isn't above using protectionism for political gain. On Tuesday the U.S. Commerce Department increased a tariff on ""dumped"" Chinese cold-rolled steel to 522%, a move that will hurt American manufacturers who need the steel to remain competitive.The tariff might score some populist points with voters in an election year. It also may be a ploy to get lawmakers to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement before President Obama leaves office. But past experience suggests that such gambits inflame protectionist sentiment rather than tamp it down.President George W. Bush imposed tariffs of up to 30% on a broad range of Chinese steel products in 2002. The Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition says the tariffs cost the U.S. economy 200,000 jobs and $4 billion in lost wages. The Obama Administration made a similar mistake in 2009, slapping ""safeguard"" tariffs on Chinese tires. Punitive tariffs on a range of other Chinese products followed, and Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs and cases at the World Trade Organization. Both sides are now in violation of WTO decisions that followed these tit-for-tat taxes.Beijing's trade record is marred by export rebates and discrimination against foreign companies. Government policy in various forms is behind the quadrupling of Chinese-steel capacity since 2000, whether through cheap credit to build new mills or the wave of public construction projects after the 2008 financial panic. China now produces about half of the world's steel, and as its own demand has subsided the excess has flooded the world market, driving down prices.But this is good news for the U.S. Since steel is an important raw material for many industries, China's trade partners benefit from its wasteful policies. Lower prices make companies that use steel more competitive and bring down prices for consumers.Daniel Pearson of the Cato Institute conservatively estimates that American companies using steel produce $990 billion in value added, more than 16 times the output of the U.S. steel industry, and also employ 16 times more workers. If tariffs on Chinese imports raise the U.S. price of steel, these companies' costs will be higher than foreign competitors', hurting their ability to grow and provide more jobs for Americans.U.S. steel makers and unions argue for high tariffs on the basis that steel users will buy American. But manufacturers complain that the U.S. mills don't produce the same range of products as the Chinese. So some will simply have to pay the tariff-inflated prices and endure the competitive damage.The steel tariff is a warm-up for the fight over granting China market-economy status in December. Beijing's 2001 accession to the WTO included a 15-year adjustment in which China was treated as a nonmarket economy for purposes of antidumping investigations.The U.S. and EU have been able to use input prices from other developing companies to estimate Chinese producers' cost of production. This lowered the evidentiary bar and resulted in high tariffs such as those on cold-rolled steel. Antidumping cases are dubious even without this statistical legerdemain, and U.S. unions and companies will lobby the next President to renege on the WTO accord.The larger question is whether the steel tariffs herald a new and more bitter era of trade retaliation. Previous skirmishes have been damaging but stopped short of full escalation. But Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton have run for President as protectionists, and Mr. Obama's surrender to steel interests is a bad omen. Chinese officials who think they can keep flooding the world with surplus goods could be in for as rude an awakening as U.S. consumers.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Moves Against Chinese Steel Are Not Protectionism"" -- WSJ May 27, 2016)",7/28/16
The Entrepreneur's Case for Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1788985623?accountid=12768,"The rise of Donald Trump has exposed a deep chasm in America between the haves and have-nots. I could go on, but you have probably read that story by now. You've also likely read about conservatives who think that stopping Mr. Trump is the only way to save their cause. I'm here to explain why they couldn't be more wrong. What principled conservatives fail to understand is how the nation would benefit from putting a right-leaning entrepreneur in the White House.I too began the primary cycle as a critic of Donald Trump. I've never come across a candidate who perfectly matched my philosophical fingerprint -- have you ever found such a match? -- but I am a Republican because the party best represents the ideals of human liberty and economic empowerment that fuel the American dream. Mr. Trump shares those values.Here are four things that the movement from the right to stop Donald Trump is missing:-- He has empathy. Mr. Trump is both a beneficiary and victim of the soundbite generation. He has leveraged social media to run a thrifty campaign, but critics have also latched onto one-liners rather than examine the whole of his record. You couldn't find one person who knows Donald Trump who thinks he's a racist. While his stance on immigration has often been expressed in brutish terms, the substance of his message -- securing America's borders and pausing the Syrian refugee program -- is not crazy. Mr. Trump's empathy, when voters see it properly expressed, will lead to victory in November and to policies fortified by longstanding conservative values.-- He is a pragmatic entrepreneur. What elitists misinterpret as uneven principles, entrepreneurs understand as adaptability. Whether you like or dislike Mr. Trump personally, you have to respect the business empire and brand he has built. He has always demonstrated an ability to take punches and get up off the mat while others without his fortitude and ingenuity would have crumbled. Most of his critics have never dared to step into the entrepreneurial arena where there exists the potential of embarrassing defeat. Mr. Trump would be the greatest pragmatist and deal maker Washington has ever seen.-- He is a team builder. I have spent several hours over the past few weeks with Mr. Trump, and I came away with the feeling he has the analytical depth to excel at the job of the presidency. Mr. Trump has put his ego aside to reinforce Corey Lewandowski's formidable campaign team with a talented group of people: Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Scott Brown, Paul Manafort, Rick Wiley and Steven Mnuchin, to name a few. Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to welcome Republican establishment figures into his coalition. The establishment should be constructive in return. If he were elected president, like any smart entrepreneur Mr. Trump would continue to surround himself with brilliant people.-- He can win. Pundits cherry-pick polls to suit their narrative, but the reality is that Mr. Trump is already in a good position even before turning his full attention to Hillary Clinton. Skeptics point to a recent CNN poll showing her with a double-digit lead, but a Rasmussen poll showing Mr. Trump leading by two points gets less attention. The electoral map is ultimately all that matters, and a Quinnipiac University poll released May 10 showed the two candidates basically in a dead heat in three crucial swing states. All of the momentum in the general election will swing to Mr. Trump, but establishment Republicans had better realize abstention would in effect be a vote to put Hillary Clinton in the White House.As the product of a middle-class household and an entrepreneur who loves this country, I understand both the appeal Mr. Trump has to the electorate and the opportunity to put Republican policies at the forefront of American politics for a generation. I'm not willing to lose this election over bruised egos.I urge my fellow Republicans to listen to the will of the people, shun the destructive cynicism of the past eight years, and unite not only for the good of the party, but for the good of the nation.---Mr. Scaramucci is the founder and co-managing partner of SkyBridge Capital.Credit: By Anthony Scaramucci",7/28/16
"Hillary Clinton to Emphasize Experience, Steadiness in Speech to Democratic Convention; Democratic nominee expected to argue for staying the course, against Donald Trump's message for change",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807433020?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA--Hillary Clinton was set to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for president Thursday, hoping her message of experience, steadiness and inclusion would prevail despite an electorate anxious for change.Her historic rise as the first female nominee of a major political party comes almost a century after American women were given the right to vote in 1920.Mrs. Clinton, who was expected to be introduced on stage by her daughter Chelsea, will leave the Democratic National Convention with a largely unified party, set for a general election that will test whether she can lead them to a third straight term in the White House.Her chief challenges include convincing Americans dissatisfied with the slow and uneven economic recovery and fearful of a spate of new terrorism attacks that staying the course is better than betting on the unpredictable agenda of Republican rival Donald Trump. All week, Democrats have argued from the convention stage that the New York billionaire was temperamentally unfit for the job.""No major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less or has been less prepared to deal with our national security,"" Vice President Joe Biden told the convention on Wednesday.But Mrs. Clinton's task was further complicated by the passions stirred by former Democratic rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who drew millions of supporters with his outrage over income inequality and campaign against the political and financial establishment.While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders made their peace ahead of the convention week, his supporters sporadically protested his defeat outside and inside the Wells Fargo Center. And, on the final day of the convention, party officials were bracing for outbursts during Mrs. Clinton's acceptance speech.Mr. Trump's fiery message of unfairness and decline in America has resonated with white, working-class voters in particular. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton's goal was to paint a more hopeful, optimistic vision of a nation that comes together and is, as her campaign slogan puts it, ""stronger together.""To underscore that message, the prime-time roster of speakers included Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, one of the nation's highest-profile Muslims, and two Republicans, Doug Elmets, who served as a speech writer in the Reagan administration, and Jennifer Pierotti Lim, co-founder of Republican Women for Hillary.One of her speech themes, aides said, would be the lessons from her book ""It Takes a Village,"" where she wrote about the impact a community can have on children.She also planned to provide a clear road map showing how she would work to boost jobs, particularly for workers whose incomes have stagnated since the 2007 recession. Her prescriptions include a big increase in federal infrastructure spending, paid family leave and significant new subsidies to make public college tuition-free for most families.A June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll underscored her task ahead. Asked if they wanted the next president to take a steady approach to the way government operates or to bring major changes even if it isn't clear what those changes will be, 56% favored change compared with 41% who wanted a steady approach.""Hillary Clinton cannot afford to simply embrace the status quo, but must show that there will be a separate route for the country's future,"" said Peter Hart, who co-directs the Journal/NBC News poll.President Barack Obama sought to clear the road ahead for Mrs. Clinton. In his address Wednesday , he reminded voters that his administration had rescued the economy from the depths of a recession, and pointed to steady job gains since then. The unemployment rate has fallen to below 5% from nearly 10% in 2009.""I am more optimistic about the future of America than ever before,"" Mr. Obama said. ""How could I not be after all that we've achieved together?""But those gains haven't translated into higher incomes for many Americans, which has left the electorate conflicted. While the president's approval ratings have risen above 50%, some seven in 10 Americans say the country is now on the wrong track.Those wrong-track numbers illustrate Mrs. Clinton's major problem, said Republican pollster Whit Ayers. ""If this election gets defined as change represented by Donald Trump and status quo represented by Hillary Clinton, Trump could win it,"" he said.The Democrats are well aware of that risk, and former President Bill Clinton's Tuesday convention address was aimed at redefining his wife as a ""change agent,"" for her ability to take on problems and find solutions.""We'll see how successful that is,"" Mr. Ayers said.It is never easy for a party to retain the White House for three straight terms. Mr. Hart said this election is fundamentally different from 2000, the last time Democrats tried to do so. In that case, he said, voters were satisfied with the nation's direction, but Vice President Al Gore mistakenly ran from Mr. Clinton's economic record.A better analogy, he said, would be 1988, when Vice President George H.W. Bush sought to follow Ronald Reagan's two terms as president. The nation wanted change, but Mr. Bush was able to win by presenting a new ""kinder, gentler"" vision of America--combined with an aggressive negative campaign aimed at Democrat Michael Dukakis.Mrs. Clinton already has tied herself tightly to Mr. Obama, in part by necessity to win the Democratic primary, and in part because she's inevitably connected to him as his former secretary of state.That impression was advanced by the symbolic passing of the torch from Mr. Obama, when Mrs. Clinton joined him on the convention stage at the end of his final, major moment on the national stage.Still, Democrats are eager for her to use his address to tell voters about her own agenda for improving their lots. ""You've got to acknowledge (the anxiety) and say here's my plan,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio).Others from the party's populist wing suggest she go even bigger. ""My advice would be to embrace change,"" said Mark Longabaugh, a top adviser to Mr. Sanders. He suggested she emphasize her newly expanded college plan, which she adopted to win over Mr. Sanders and his young supporters.""In every campaign, there's always a tension between the cautious approach and the bold approach,"" he said. ""The country is in the mood for much bigger change than incremental change.""More on Election 2016* Pennsylvania Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Keeping Sizable Lead* Obama Rallies Democrats Behind Hillary Clinton at Convention* Donald Trump on Hacking Comments: 'Of Course I'm Being Sarcastic'* Clinton's Strategy Begins With Parrying Trump in Rust Belt* Hillary Clinton's Inner Circle* Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Foreign-Policy IssuesCredit: By Laura Meckler and Siobhan Hughes",7/29/16
Economists Lower Forecasts for Mexican Growth; U.S. elections seen adding to the uncertainty amid anti-Mexico comments from GOP candidate Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807916074?accountid=12768,"MEXICO CITY--Economists surveyed in July by the Bank of Mexico reduced their expectations for economic growth this year, seeing weak external demand and a sluggish global economy as the main risks for Mexico.Mexico's gross domestic product is expected to grow 2.3% in 2016, according to the median estimate of 35 analysts polled last month by the central bank, compared with 2.4% forecast in June.Responses to the survey were received before Friday's preliminary GDP report , which showed Mexico's output of goods and services falling 0.3% in the second quarter from the first, equivalent to an annualized seasonally adjusted decline of 1.2%.The downturn in the economy comes at a complicated time given Mexico's widening current-account deficit, which relies in part on financing for short-term capital inflows and increased levels of public-sector debt, the Vector Casa de Bolsa brokerage house said in its weekly report.""As if that wasn't enough, the Mexican economy is also suffering from an additional external shock related to the U.S. electoral process,"" Vector added. Mexico has been a point of focus for Republican candidate Donald Trump, who says he plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and renegotiate or abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement.The U.S. election process is generating uncertainty and could be putting investment decisions on hold, Vector added.Only 12% of analysts polled in July by the central bank considered now to be a good time to invest, down from 18% in June, while 35% considered it a bad time to invest, up from 21%. The remaining 53% were unsure.The most-mentioned obstacles to growth in Mexico were weak external markets and the global economic slowdown, followed by international financial instability and reduced Mexican oil production.The Bank of Mexico survey showed inflation expectations for 2016 rising modestly to 3.2% from 3.1% in June, while the median estimate for core inflation--which excludes energy and fresh fruit and vegetables--remained unchanged at 3.2%.The Mexican peso is expected to end the year at 18.62 to the U.S. dollar, compared with 18.31 in the June survey. The currency was recently quoted in Mexico City at 18.8570 to the dollar. The central bank cited inflationary risks from a weaker peso in its June 29 decision to raise its reference interest rate by half a percentage point to 4.25%.Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.comCredit: By Anthony Harrup",8/1/16
"Trump, Trade, Technology and American Jobs",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807838682?accountid=12768,"Regarding Mary Anastasia O'Grady's ""Wharton Grad Trump Fails Economics"" (Americas, July 25): I farm in Iowa and provide consulting services to agribusiness companies at home and abroad. I recall that most basic of Economics 101 lessons about ""the gains from trade."" It amazes, shocks and disappoints me (and many of us in agriculture in the Midwest who depend on exports) that so many of our politicians are ready to ""tear up trade agreements"" and erect trade barriers. Have any of these people, including Donald Trump, ever heard of the Great Depression?For the pork industry, Nafta and the Mexican market demonstrate a classic case in point. Before Nafta, U.S. pork producers had virtually zero market in Mexico. Today, the U.S. pork industry exports about one quarter of its production, around $6 billion a year, and thanks to Nafta Mexico is now our No. 1 market in volume and No. 2 market in value. The Trans-Pacific Partnership represents another exciting opportunity for U.S. agriculture to continue to grow exports of American food, feed and fiber.It's truly disheartening to hear the presidential candidates disavow the benefits of trade to the American economy. Ms. O'Grady's piece is spot-on by pointing out that it is technology that is putting people out of work, not trade agreements.Brian M. FosterHampton, Iowa---The move of our company, California Cedar Products Co., to China had nothing to do with advances in technology. We are a manufacturer of slats for the subsequent manufacture of pencils. Our company (with about 1,500 employees including six sawmills) was the last slat factory to produce in the U.S. We were the last one here because we survived due to our advanced technology using very thin saws to increase the yield from wood. But the saving in wood wasn't enough to offset the cost of labor.China began selling finished pencils in the U.S. in the late 1980s at prices lower than our slats. We moved our factory to China, even after negotiating a 14.8% decrease in wages and benefits in 1998. After the move our labor costs in China decreased 90%. The problem was that by then the Chinese had taken a large share of our business.The Chinese were selling pencils below cost: therefore a tariff would have been the proper temporary solution. Perhaps the American consumer can buy pencils cheaper now that there are hardly any manufacturers left here but think of the economics and buying power of employing the 15,000 or so former U.S. pencil-making workers in our society. Luckily we're still in business, but we have only about five employees in the U.S.Before we moved we even contacted President Clinton and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The former completely ignored our petition and the latter canceled an appointment the day before she was supposed to attend a big factory meeting with our employees. So don't rely on the government to do anything except tax you to death.Philip C. BerolzheimerStockton, Calif.---As one of the analysts crunching the numbers, I can absolutely assure Ms. O'Grady that the reason why the company I worked for moved over 7,500 manufacturing jobs from the U.S. to Mexico was 100% due to the ability Nafta afforded the company to take advantage of lower Mexican wages. The technology used in the U.S. plants was all shipped to the Mexican ones.Frank ViolaJenkintown, Pa.---Technology has certainly made it easier for government regulators to grind out and enforce a never-ending stream of onerous rules that increase the cost of production without increasing the value of the product or service regulated. Technology-based labor is much easier to relocate to a less expensive and less restrictive job market.Technology has reduced not only the overall cost of production of most goods, but also the logistics cost associated with bringing those products to market.Yes, there is still a major international market for U.S.-produced goods, but there is also good reason to restore a more appropriate balance of ""free trade"" based on terms that are at least equally favorable to the U.S.Jack HamiltonSilverdale, Wash.---What is missing is an accounting of the number of foreign companies that are building factories and setting up businesses here in America. We should be encouraging more foreign companies to come here.Tom HatfieldHilton Head Is., S.C.",8/1/16
"Economy Buffets Presidential Election; Mixed economic signals complicate sharply different views of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807822689?accountid=12768,"The U.S. economy is flashing mixed signals heading toward November's election, complicating the narrative for both presidential campaigns in a race featuring sharply different views of the vitality of the seven-year expansion.Historically, elections often hinge on popular perceptions of the economy's health, particularly those that solidify in the early summer of an election year. That puts a premium on economic gauges in June and July, be it on overall output, the pace of hiring or measures of consumer sentiment.New figures out Friday showed U.S. gross domestic product, a broad measure of output, averaged a paltry 1% seasonally adjusted annual growth rate through the year's first half, well below historical norms. That has raised fears the economy is slowing heading into the election, with some economists warning of a possible recession by year end.That would add a new headwind for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as she tries to fend off Republican contender Donald Trump, since her campaign in part is based on praising the success fellow Democrat President Barack Obama has had in rejuvenating the economy since 2009. Research shows voters can take a dimmer view of incumbent parties when the economy is underperforming.At the same time, other important measures, related to jobs, wages, consumer spending and consumer confidence, suggest a degree of resilience for the seven-year expansion, undercutting Mr. Trump's portrayal of an economy in dismal shape.Economic ups and downs almost always play into presidential campaigns, as they did in 2012, when steady hiring aided Mr. Obama.In the past three elections comparable to this one, in which a two-term president was stepping down--1988, 2000 and 2008--the state of the economy played a key role, but in highly unpredictable ways.In 1988, George H.W. Bush won his first term, and the Republican Party's third consecutive term, in the White House. The economy, in the fifth year of a robust expansion, certainly helped.GDP, for example, advanced at a 3.9% pace during the first half of that year, faster than the post-World War II average of about 3.2%.The labor market also was expanding at a solid clip. Nonfarm payrolls grew by more than 3.4 million from mid-1987 to mid-1988.By mid-1988, consumer spending had climbed 8% from a year earlier. (Currently it is up less than 4%.) The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed confidence on the rise.In 2000, a vibrant economy failed to propel Al Gore into the White House, which would have been a third straight term for Democrats.At the midpoint of 2000, GDP was averaging a 4.5% growth rate, the labor market had added close to three million jobs over the previous year, consumer spending was up 7.7% and consumer sentiment was coming off a record high.Republican George W. Bush won the contested election by a whisker after a Supreme Court case over Florida vote counting was decided in his favor.In mid-2008, the housing market was collapsing, Lehman Brothers was on the brink of bankruptcy and the economy was months into a deep, protracted recession. GDP contracted and the labor market was shedding jobs. While consumers continued to spend, confidence was in free fall. Mr. Obama defeated Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.).How does the economy look now?The biggest mark against the economy is found in the broadest measure of growth. GDP is up a meager 1% through the first half of the year, dragged down by a pullback in investment by companies, a drawdown in business inventories and slower government spending.The labor market has been performing well, though not as well as the 1988 and 2000 cycles. Nonfarm payrolls are up by about 2.5 million over the past year, while the unemployment rate in June was 4.9%, compared with 5.4% in 1988, 4% in 2000 and 5.6% in 2008.Consumers are offering a key support for the economy, with their spending up 3.7% from a year earlier. Consumer confidence is roughly in line with 1988 but well short of 2000 levels.""The economy in terms of the growth rate of GDP is clearly not a plus for the Democrats in 2016,"" said Ray Fair, a Yale University professor who has written extensively on the economy's impact on elections. Tepid output combined with the electorate's tendency to vote out a two-term incumbent party are working against Mrs. Clinton, he said.Based on his model, which isn't always right but did forecast a Bush victory in 1988, an Obama victory in 2008 and an election too close to call in 2000, Mrs. Clinton is poised to capture only about 45% of the vote come November.Still, Mr. Fair said, 2016 is an unusual election and Mr. Trump an atypical candidate for the Republican Party.Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@wsj.comCredit: By Jeffrey Sparshott",8/1/16
Election 2016: Trump Is Slow to Organize in Key State --- Presumptive nominee lags behind Clinton in building team in Ohio; Kasich still on sideline,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790309428?accountid=12768,"PLAIN TOWNSHIP, Ohio -- Though Donald Trump dispensed with his last primary opponent months before Hillary Clinton will, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee trails far behind the leading Democrat in organizing in a key general-election state.Ohio, which has backed every presidential winner since 1964, presents both Mr. Trump's best opportunity to carry a big swing state and reveals his team's steep logistical challenges.Mr. Trump doesn't have any general-election staff in Ohio, and senior aides in New York and Washington haven't made contact with the state Republican Party. Efforts to recruit the state's experienced operatives who helped elect Gov. John Kasich have so far been unsuccessful, people familiar with the matter said.Mrs. Clinton has a small team of full-time aides in Ohio, where they are working to rebuild the organization that twice carried the state for President Barack Obama.""It's like we're all at ground zero,"" said Ed Rollins, who is co-chairman of the pro-Trump super PAC called the Great America PAC. ""I think we have a superior candidate. It's a question of whether you can build the resources.""Mr. Trump's slow start, here and elsewhere, could undermine his goal of expanding the Republican presidential map into the industrial Midwest.Ohio's electorate is tailor-made for Mr. Trump's populist message on immigration and trade. Among states that were competitive in the 2012 general election, only New Hampshire has a smaller percentage of Hispanics -- who overwhelmingly disapprove of Mr. Trump -- than Ohio's 3.5%.Restricting foreign trade, one of Mr. Trump's signature issues, is a particularly potent issue in the manufacturing-heavy state and has emerged as a centerpiece of Democrat Ted Strickland's campaign to oust GOP Sen. Rob Portman.And this year's March primary, which Mr. Trump lost to Mr. Kasich, added 363,000 more Republican voters to the state's voter rolls than Democrats, according to Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted.Mr. Trump's troubles recruiting Ohio staff come as the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows broad sections of Republicans are coalescing behind the New York developer, helping him narrow the gap with Mrs. Clinton to 3 percentage points.In the past week, Mr. Trump's political director Rick Wiley began his search for top Ohio staff, which he hopes to have in place by June.One of Mr. Wiley's first Ohio calls went to Jeff Polesovsky, the political director for Mr. Kasich's presidential campaign and a senior aide during his two runs for governor. Mr. Polesovsky told Mr. Wiley that he isn't ready to join the Trump campaign, according to people familiar with the conversation. Mr. Kasich has declined to endorse Mr. Trump.The governor hasn't put out a formal notice to his aides to avoid working for Mr. Trump, but several of them interviewed said they wouldn't take a job with him without first discussing it with Mr. Kasich.""There's no one in a senior- or midlevel position in the campaign in Ohio or in any of the states where we had staff who would or will be going to work for Donald Trump,"" said John Weaver, Mr. Kasich's senior strategist during his presidential campaign. ""The very things that attracted them to John are the things that would keep them from working for Trump. Plus, they would be shot.""Meanwhile, Clinton aides are preparing to open the first campaign office in Columbus and have begun coordinating with the Ohio Democratic Party to recruit an army of volunteers who backed both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders in the state's primary.At the same time, Priorities USA, the super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, last week began airing the first $6 million of TV advertising attacking Mr. Trump in Ohio, Virginia, Nevada and Florida. The super PACs backing Mr. Trump are still trying to raise money while his campaign is only now building a national fundraising apparatus.Mr. Wiley said the Trump campaign has ""made tremendous strides"" building its general election team since becoming the presumptive nominee.Yet senior Trump aides have had no communication with the Ohio Republican Party and very little with aides to Mr. Portman, who has built his own statewide get-out-the-vote apparatus as he prepares for a difficult re-election bid. The Ohio GOP chairman, Matt Borges, who emerged during the primary campaign as one of the nation's most strident anti-Trump voices, said he hasn't done anything to help Mr. Trump because he hasn't heard what the campaign would like him to do.Mrs. Clinton's team here is led by Chris Wyant, a veteran of Mr. Obama's two Ohio campaigns. Last week, Mr. Wyant and another Clinton aide watched as 30 local Democratic Party activists made calls to recruit volunteers.About half of the activists interviewed said they backed Mr. Sanders during Ohio's primary, but each believed they must work to elect Mrs. Clinton.""The difference between any Democrat and Trump is so spectacular that I had to come help,"" said Tony Collins-Sibley, a 54-year-old cabinet maker who wore a ""Bernie 2016"" T-shirt.Credit: By Reid J.

Trump Narrows Gap With Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790309388?accountid=12768,"Republicans have rallied behind Donald Trump in the weeks since he effectively clinched his party's presidential nomination, helping him narrow Democrat Hillary Clinton's once double-digit lead to just 3 percentage points, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows.Mrs. Clinton leads the New York businessman, 46% to 43%, in a test matchup between the two likely nominees, the poll finds. That represents a much tighter margin than her 11-percentage-point lead in April and marks the first time in Journal/NBC News polling this year that her support has dropped below 50% in a contest with Mr. Trump.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who faces long odds of wresting the Democratic nomination from Mrs. Clinton, leads Mr. Trump by a much wider, 15-point margin, 54% to 39%, in a hypothetical matchup.The main reason Mr. Trump has eaten into Mrs. Clinton's lead is he enjoys much wider support from GOP voters after his decisive win in the Indiana primary earlier this month, a victory that prompted his two remaining rivals to exit the race. The presumptive GOP nominee has also opened a modest lead among self-described independent voters.In the matchup against Mrs. Clinton, Republican support for Mr. Trump jumped to 86% from 72% in mid-April, while the share of GOP voters who said they would support Mrs. Clinton fell to 6% from 13% a month earlier. Democrats' support for Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, remains largely unchanged.The poll shows the race at this early point is virtually a statistical dead heat. That is in keeping with other polling done since Mr. Trump vanquished his remaining Republican primary foes.To some extent the polling reflects for Mr. Trump the boost that naturally comes when a candidate prevails in a primary race and stops coming under direct attack by his primary rivals, a luxury Mrs. Clinton doesn't have and may not until her party's July convention. Still, the results, though early, are troubling for the Democratic team because they may suggest how much damage the bruising primary fight has done to her, which could linger after the battle ends.""Republican voters are consolidating behind Trump. And a more united Republican Party, combined with an electorate looking for major change, has made this a too-close-to-call campaign,"" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducts the Journal/NBC News survey with Democrat Fred Yang.The two likely nominees still suffer from the worst public images in the modern history of presidential politics, with 58% viewing Mr. Trump negatively and 54% expressing similar sentiments about Mrs. Clinton. But that tally marks an improvement for Mr. Trump since April, when some 65% of voters expressed an unfavorable opinion about him.""Either one is a terrible choice,"" said Steve Swanstrom, 78, a Republican in Fort Myers, Fla., who favored Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the primary and isn't sure what he will do in November.A more favorable view of Mr. Trump among Republicans is primarily responsible for his improved image. In April, GOP voters split 42% to 42% between those who viewed him favorably and those who saw him in a negative light. This month, after Mr. Trump essentially sealed the nomination, the split was 58% positive to 25% negative.Mr. Trump also enjoys a slightly better -- if still overwhelmingly negative -- image among independent voters, with 58% viewing him negatively and 26% viewing him positively. Independents now see him slightly more positively than they do Mrs. Clinton, helping the Republican open a 5-percentage-point lead over the likely Democratic nominee among these voters.""Again, Donald Trump defies the conventional wisdom by consolidating the GOP support early, but a much steeper hill lies ahead with independents and persuadable voters,"" said Peter Hart, a Democrat who is part of the Journal/NBC News polling team.Perhaps the best news in the survey for Mr. Trump is that he outpaces Mrs. Clinton, 46% to 43%, in the 12 most competitive presidential battleground states -- states that President Barack Obama won by 1.5 percentage points in 2012. He does particularly well in the South and Midwest.But national polls such as this don't fully capture the two candidates' standing in these 12 states because they aggregate the numbers, which can vary dramatically from one state to the next.The share of Democratic primary voters who view Mrs. Clinton favorably dropped from 84% last June to 65% in the latest poll, while the share who view her negatively jumped from 7% to 21%.A chief task for any nominee is to unify his or her party ahead of the general election. In the new survey, some 83% of Democrats said they prefer Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump, down slightly from 87% in April.A remarkable 1-in-10 voters say they wouldn't vote for either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump, and 47% say they would consider an independent or third-party candidate in the fall, up from 40% in the spring of 2012.Mr. Yang, the Democratic pollster, said that ""despite a rough couple weeks and the prospect of a tough campaign ahead, the fundamentals look favorable for Hillary Clinton. Her advantage in the trial heat against Trump for the most part mirrors the Obama '12 numbers among key constituencies; in fact, Trump is doing slightly less well among white voters overall than Romney did four years ago.""The survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted May 15-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",8/1/16
Trump Is Closing Deal With Republican Elite,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790320462?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Republican leaders and donors, who for months took a frosty, hands-off view of Donald Trump, this week significantly warmed to the New York real-estate mogul as the fractured party began closing ranks behind its presumptive presidential nominee.Beginning with his visit with GOP congressional leaders on Capitol Hill late last week, Mr. Trump has made steady inroads with the party's elite as prominent skeptics have dropped or buried their objections in deference to their shared quest to defeat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November.""You're better off riding the beast than trying to ignore it,"" said Stewart Verdery, the founder of lobbying and public-affairs firm Monument Policy Group and a former Senate Republican aide.In one pivotal moment this week, social conservatives and tea-party members said that Mr. Trump's release of 11 possible candidates to fill the Supreme Court vacancy assuaged one of their biggest concerns about the businessman -- that he isn't a true conservative and abortion foe.""The list of the judges was a very good step in the right direction. We're making progress,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) told reporters.Mr. Ryan, who jolted the party by saying earlier this month that he wasn't ready to endorse Mr. Trump, still hasn't backed the candidate, some of whose stances clash with his own limited-government philosophy. But Mr. Ryan said his policy aides were now meeting regularly with Mr. Trump's staff to ""make sure that we are unifying around our commonly held principles and policies.""Significant pockets of resistance to Mr. Trump still remain within the party. Many lawmakers are mum about his candidacy and some say they won't attend the party convention in July. A few leaders who have qualms over his style, rhetoric and contentious policy stances -- including a hard line on immigration and an expansive view of presidential power -- continue a quiet effort to field an alternate independent or third-party candidate.Many high-ranking Republicans said they were caught off-guard by the speed with which Mr. Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee after his decisive May 3 Indiana primary victory prompted his rivals to end their campaigns. With a contested GOP convention no longer looming in Cleveland in late July, the ranks of holdouts to Mr. Trump's polarizing brand of politics have started to shrink.The GOP's growing acceptance of Mr. Trump coincides with a raucous week in the Democratic primary. Although she holds a commanding lead in delegates, Mrs. Clinton still faces attacks from her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who continues to win some primary contests, including in Oregon this week.But Democrats projected confidence that Mr. Trump's plans to deport all illegal immigrants and ban Muslims from entering the U.S., as well as critical comments about women, would incite a revolt against him in November.""Donald Trump is going to unite the Democratic Party in a way we haven't seen in a generation,"" Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.) said this week. ""The choice is going to be stark.""Mrs. Clinton's campaign has targeted foreign policy as a weakness of Mr. Trump, who has questioned the value of long-held international alliances and praised contentious foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump notched an important organizational victory this week, finalizing a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee that will allow donors to write checks of up to $449,400. Heading the Trump Victory committee as finance chairman will be Lew Eisenberg, a veteran fundraiser who also serves as finance chairman of the RNC.Since declaring earlier this month that he didn't plan to self-fund his general-election campaign, Mr. Trump has drawn some of his party's traditional top donors, though others are staying on the sidelines. Oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens endorsed his campaign last week and is planning to hold a fundraiser for the pro-Trump super PAC, Great America PAC, at his Texas ranch next month.Minnesota broadcasting billionaire Stanley Hubbard, who backed the presidential bids of mainstream party favorites, including Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, has also endorsed Mr. Trump and signed on to the super PAC as a co-chairman.On Capitol Hill, attendance is growing at a weekly meeting of Mr. Trump's House GOP supporters and his campaign advisers. Even some vulnerable Republicans, who have refrained from endorsing Mr. Trump, have praised some of his recent actions.GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, locked in a tight re-election fight against former state official Katie McGinty in Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania, has so far not backed Mr. Trump. But on Friday, he told a talk-radio host Mr. Trump had released a ""very good list"" of potential successors for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.Mr. Trump patted himself on the back on Friday for the list's impact in wooing conservatives.""The effect it's had is incredible,"" he said at a forum hosted by the political arm of the National Rifle Association.---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Kristina Peterson and Siobhan Hughes",8/1/16
Trump for Blow-Upper in Chief?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790317524?accountid=12768,"Correction: The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids tells me that, while it has received donations from lawyers involved in the 1998 tobacco litigation, it has an ""explicit policy"" of not taking settlement funds.Washington can't protect workers against technological and competitive obsolescence. It can't excuse Americans from adapting to an economy and updating their skills.Instead, America's salvation has been a dynamic that, over time, creates more good jobs than it destroys. As much as anything, damage to this dynamic explains this election year. It explains the coalition forming around Donald Trump, consisting of people who believe what Mr. Trump says (fans of building a wall and starting a trade war) and those who don't (hedge funds).Leading the latter contingent is fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, once a ferocious denouncer of Mr. Trump, who now says The Donald has merely been ""tweaking [the establishment] by saying this nonsense, to the great enjoyment of the middle and lower class."" Thus does Mr. Trump prove the glory of the two-party system, the powerful, centralizing ballast of American national greatness, which forces incompatibles to get in bed with each other.A Journal story that probably didn't get the notice it deserved tells of the troubles of a small-business owner in Italy.The Italian economy hasn't grown in 10 years. Consumers aren't spending. A lack of bank lending for small business makes it impossible for restaurant owner Massimiliano Masuelli to invest in modern technology. He can't lay off workers because labor regulation makes it too expensive. Politicians, rather than helping, add to his overhead with new health and safety mandates.In Italy, dying small businesses, with 10 or fewer workers, employ 46% of the workforce.Readers may tire of antiregulation screeds but nobody persists in a project if government keeps raising obstacles to it. In the U.S., the administration has now embraced a $15 minimum wage, a favorite of big labor as a way to ward off competition from lower-downs. Its new overtime rule for salaried workers will arbitrarily raise costs for thousands of employers while imposing record-keeping duties on thousands more.The administration's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to kill payday lenders because they charge high annual percentage rates. But lenders compete, prices reflect costs, and the administration offers no solution (except to go on disability) for a worker who needs $800 fast so he can fix his car, so he can keep his job, so he can pay his rent.The Obama Federal Communications Commission has been a real beauty. Through a succession of rules, orders and merger approvals, it has favored big broadband providers over small ones, rich urban communities over broadband-deprived rural areas and small towns, and consistently pressured broadband companies to keep broadband prices high for grannies and other light users in order to subsidize fixed rates and superfluous gigabit speeds for the avidly tweeting cyber elite.Why?Then the President's Council of Economic Advisers complains about a growing concentration in banking, airlines and telecommunications without noticing how the administration's own regulatory onslaught has made these industries unwelcoming to small companies lacking the requisite armies of lawyers and lobbyists.People can debate in every case where the public interest lies. Indeed, because such arguments are always possible, no area of life or decision-making is free of calls for federal intervention. But in the frantic rule-making of the late Obama administration, including its attempt to dictate state and local bathroom regulation, thoughtful consideration of the public good is absent. The administration is manufacturing talking points and wedge issues for the election, in the process creating costs for the American people that will long outlast the election. Why? Because Democrats must win, that's why.So, a former FCC staffer writes that his ex-agency is ""now in the near-exclusive business of shifting profits among corporate giants.""The Competitive Enterprise Institute finds that, last year, Congress passed a mere 114 laws and federal agencies issued a whopping 3,410 regulations. At 80,260 pages, last year's Federal Register was the third fattest in history.A Kauffman Foundation study cites a proliferation of ""incumbent protection"" rules as a reason for a decline in small-business entrepreneurship. A Brookings Institution study shows, in an unheralded change in American life, business closures exceeded business starts during much of President Obama's tenure.How many times have voters been heard saying they want Mr. Trump in Washington to ""blow the place up""? Where they get their confidence that from the smoking wreckage something useful would sprout, only heaven knows. But it is not an irrational bet when you know the alternative.Credit: By Holman W.

REVIEW --- Word on the Street: 'Goofy' as Trump's Latest Taunt,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790149749?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's litany of disparaging nicknames for his political opponents shows no sign of abating, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren his latest target.At a campaign rally in Eugene, Ore., on May 6, Mr. Trump taunted Ms. Warren in a salvo against Hillary Clinton. ""I just learned that Crooked Hillary, along with her friend -- you know, she's got this goofy friend named Elizabeth Warren, she's on a Twitter rant. She's a goofus.""Sen. Warren swiftly responded on Twitter: ""'Goofy,' @realDonaldTrump? For a guy with 'the best words' that's a pretty lame nickname. Weak!""University of Delaware English professor Ben Yagoda recently noted in a Chronicle of Higher Education blog post that Mr. Trump's penchant for nicknaming (his Twitter repertoire now includes ""Goofy Elizabeth Warren"" and ""Crazy Bernie Sanders"") could be seen as a ""single-handed revival of the Homeric epithet."" But Homer's epithets were descriptive rather than derogatory, and most were reserved for gods and heroes -- such as ""swift-footed Achilles"" or ""gray-eyed Athena.""Both ""goofy"" and ""goofus"" go back to ""goof,"" originally a word for a simpleton or clumsy fool, with a possible root in the Middle French ""goffe,"" meaning ""awkward"" or ""stupid."" In the early 20th century, ""goof"" became a popular put-down in American slang. Ring Lardner, for instance, has a character in his 1916 story ""Gullible's Travels"" say, ""It ain't the same show, you goof!""The adjective ""goofy,"" meaning silly or stupid, took off among U.S. soldiers in World War I. A 1918 article in the Idaho Daily Statesman listed the word among the slang used by young men training at Camp Lewis in Tacoma, Wash.: ""The recruit of enfeebled intellect is no longer 'nutty' or a 'feeb'; he is 'goofy.'"" A decade and a half later, Walt Disney's animated shorts would introduce the simple-minded anthropomorphic dog, Goofy.Around the same time, ""goofus"" emerged as a comical name for someone foolish. In 1916, the syndicated humor columnist Arthur ""Bugs"" Baer started using ""Goofus"" to label various silly characters, and that same year, a story in the magazine Our Navy featured a ship with a ""pet hippopotamus mascot"" named Goofus.""Goofus"" was also the title of a novelty hit for bandleader Wayne King in 1930. Gus Kahn's lyrics tell of a self-taught saxophone player from Iowa: ""I'd start to play, folks used to say, sounds a little goofus to me.""In the late 1940s, ""goofus"" got another boost of attention thanks to the children's magazine Highlights and its cartoon feature ""Goofus & Gallant."" In each installment, the behavior of a polite and respectful boy named Gallant was contrasted with his immature friend Goofus.Likely influenced by ""goofus,"" the epithet ""doofus"" first showed up in the 1950s. John Lardner (a son of Ring) used it in a 1955 New York Times story to label a dimwitted boxer: ""Doofus lost every round from the third . . . !""It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will use ""doofus"" in his next round of name-calling.Credit: By Ben Zimmer",8/1/16

""I am going to put criminals behind bars and guarantee that law-abiding Americans have the right to self-defense.""Mrs. Clinton has put gun control at the center of her campaign and has been traveling with mothers of children who died from gun violence and at the hands of law enforcement. She will speak Saturday at a Miami dinner sponsored by the Trayvon Martin Foundation, a gun-control group honoring the Florida teenager slain by neighborhood-watch volunteer George Zimmerman.Mr. Trump wasn't the top choice of some at the NRA event, in part because he backed an assault-weapons ban and a longer waiting period for gun sales in a 2000 book. But if the general election pits him against Mrs. Clinton, who has vowed to ""change the gun culture"" and ""take on the gun lobby,"" firearm owners say their choice will be an easy one.NRA leaders at the annual forum cast the election more as a referendum on Mrs. Clinton than as an opportunity to support Mr. Trump. If she is elected, ""you can kiss your guns goodbye,"" NRA Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre told the crowd.""If your preferred candidate dropped out of the race, it's time to get over it,"" said Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute of Legislative Action, who announced the endorsement of Mr. Trump. The current vacancy on the Supreme Court means ""the Second Amendment is on the ballot,"" he added.Mrs. Clinton signaled last week that she was ready to debate Mr. Trump on guns, posting on Twitter: ""FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in the office.""Mr. Trump floated a proposal earlier this year to do away with gun-free school zones. ""I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools,"" Mr. Trump said in Vermont in January. ""My first day, it gets signed, OK?""Mr. Trump would need Congress to repeal a 1990 federal law signed by former Republican President George H.W. Bush that forbids most firearms near school grounds.The candidate's previous support for an assault-weapons ban isn't the only issue some NRA members have with Mr. Trump, who switched in and out of the Republican Party before rejoining in 2012. He has challenged party orthodoxy on free trade, taxes and foreign policy, and once supported abortion rights.""I'm holding my nose,"" said Marshall Mac Euen, a 62-year-old lighting salesman from Birmingham, Ala. ""He's not a Republican. He's not a conservative. I just don't trust him.""He and other gun owners wary of Mr. Trump, however, say they would rather see just about anybody in the White House than Mrs. Clinton.""We will not vote for Hillary Clinton. We will not vote for Hillary Clinton,"" said 65-year-old Dan Bridges of Washington, D.C., who attended the conference with two fellow U.S. Naval Academy graduates.Credit: By Beth Reinhard",8/1/16

"Trump, Trade, Technology and American Jobs; Before Nafta, U.S. pork producers had virtually zero market in Mexico.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807766164?accountid=12768,"Regarding Mary Anastasia O'Grady's ""Wharton Grad Trump Fails Economics "" (Americas, July 25): I farm in Iowa and provide consulting services to agribusiness companies at home and abroad. I recall that most basic of Economics 101 lessons about ""the gains from trade."" It amazes, shocks and disappoints me (and many of us in agriculture in the Midwest who depend on exports) that so many of our politicians are ready to ""tear up trade agreements"" and erect trade barriers. Have any of these people, including Donald Trump, ever heard of the Great Depression?For the pork industry, Nafta and the Mexican market demonstrate a classic case in point. Before Nafta, U.S. pork producers had virtually zero market in Mexico. Today, the U.S. pork industry exports about one quarter of its production, around $6 billion a year, and thanks to Nafta Mexico is now our No. 1 market in volume and No. 2 market in value. The Trans-Pacific Partnership represents another exciting opportunity for U.S. agriculture to continue to grow exports of American food, feed and fiber.It's truly disheartening to hear the presidential candidates disavow the benefits of trade to the American economy. Ms. O'Grady's piece is spot-on by pointing out that it is technology that is putting people out of work, not trade agreements.Brian M. FosterHampton, IowaThe move of our company, California Cedar Products Co., to China had nothing to do with advances in technology. We are a manufacturer of slats for the subsequent manufacture of pencils. Our company (with about 1,500 employees including six sawmills) was the last slat factory to produce in the U.S. We were the last one here because we survived due to our advanced technology using very thin saws to increase the yield from wood. But the saving in wood wasn't enough to offset the cost of labor.China began selling finished pencils in the U.S. in the late 1980s at prices lower than our slats. We moved our factory to China, even after negotiating a 14.8% decrease in wages and benefits in 1998. After the move our labor costs in China decreased 90%. The problem was that by then the Chinese had taken a large share of our business.The Chinese were selling pencils below cost: therefore a tariff would have been the proper temporary solution. Perhaps the American consumer can buy pencils cheaper now that there are hardly any manufacturers left here but think of the economics and buying power of employing the 15,000 or so former U.S. pencil-making workers in our society. Luckily we're still in business, but we have only about five employees in the U.S.Before we moved we even contacted President Clinton and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The former completely ignored our petition and the latter canceled an appointment the day before she was supposed to attend a big factory meeting with our employees. So don't rely on the government to do anything except tax you to death.Philip C. BerolzheimerStockton, Calif.As one of the analysts crunching the numbers, I can absolutely assure Ms. O'Grady that the reason why the company I worked for moved over 7,500 manufacturing jobs from the U.S. to Mexico was 100% due to the ability Nafta afforded the company to take advantage of lower Mexican wages. The technology used in the U.S. plants was all shipped to the Mexican ones.Frank ViolaJenkintown, Pa.Technology has certainly made it easier for government regulators to grind out and enforce a never-ending stream of onerous rules that increase the cost of production without increasing the value of the product or service regulated. Technology-based labor is much easier to relocate to a less expensive and less restrictive job market.Technology has reduced not only the overall cost of production of most goods, but also the logistics cost associated with bringing those products to market.Yes, there is still a major international market for U.S.-produced goods, but there is also good reason to restore a more appropriate balance of ""free trade"" based on terms that are at least equally favorable to the U.S.Jack HamiltonSilverdale, Wash.What is missing is an accounting of the number of foreign companies that are building factories and setting up businesses here in America. We should be encouraging more foreign companies to come here.Tom HatfieldHilton Head Is., S.C.",8/3/16

He also said he still plans to release his tax returns, after declaring them none of the public's business.Mr. Trump again mockingly called Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is emerging as a chief Democratic protagonist, ""Pocahontas"" because of her past claim to Native American heritage.""I think she is as Native American as I am. OK? That I will tell you. But she's a woman that's been very ineffective other than she's got a big mouth,"" Mr. Trump said.When he called her Pocahontas, Nicole Robertson, a Cree Indian who works as a reporter, called out ""very offensive.""

Oh, I'm sorry about that,"" he said.Ms. Warren, who called Mr. Trump a ""small, insecure money grubber"" in a speech Tuesday, said Wednesday that he can ""fling as much mud"" as he wants but she won't back down.The exchange underscored the unprecedented nature of his first-time candidacy, and signaled that the 2016 election season is likely to remain on its uncharted course through November's general election despite calls from some Republicans for him to be more statesmanlike.Mr. Trump taunted his chief Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, for enduring a longer primary fight than he did, and reupped an invitation to her primary opponent -- Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- to debate him, but only if he or television networks produces a $10 million charitable donation.The presumptive GOP presidential nominee spoke to reporters while standing before most of the 21-member North Dakota delegation to the Republican National Convention, including John Trandem, a Fargo-area antiabortion activist who the Associated Press reported Thursday became the 1,237th GOP delegate to back his candidacy, putting him over the top.Mr. Trandem, like many of the state's delegates, had previously backed Mr. Trump's former rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. North Dakota's delegates are free to change their allegiance at any time.The GOP standard-bearer refused to back off his criticism of the job being done by New Mexico's Republican governor, Susana Martinez, who has yet to endorse him. But he did receive an olive branch from one of his other former rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.""I want to be helpful,"" Mr. Rubio said in a CNN interview, offering to make appearances for Mr. Trump. ""I don't want to be harmful because I don't want Hillary Clinton to be president.""As the party continues to coalesce around his candidacy, Mr. Trump is repositioning himself for the fall general election. He declined to repeat his past call for a ban on Muslims entering the country, a proposal he offered in December five days after a husband-and-wife team shot 14 people at a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., an act of terrorism that many believe was fueled by their interpretation of their Islamic faith.At that time, Mr. Trump called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"" -- a proposal that remains on his campaign website.But Mr. Trump called that pledge ""a suggestion"" during a Fox News interview earlier this month. On Thursday, he dodged the question. ""We're going to look at a lot of different things,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We have to be vigilant and we have to be tough and smart.""Asked a second time if he still supported the Muslim-entry ban, Mr. Trump replied: ""As of this moment I am very unhappy when I look at the world of radical Islam."" He added: ""We're going to come up with a solution.""On ethanol, Mr. Trump also hedged his once-strident support of federal protections for the corn ethanol industry. In January -- ahead of the Iowa caucuses -- he used that issue as a cudgel to attack Mr. Cruz, who called for phasing out the Renewable Fuel Standard.Mr. Trump said he would have to discuss the issue with Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a staunch supporter of the program, saying ""we're going to look at"" whether he will continue to back the federal ethanol mandate.Mr. Trump used his energy speech, delivered to attendees at an oil conference in the heart of the U.S. oil boom, to lay out an expansive policy that encourages production of fossil fuels, repeals a raft of Obama administration environmental rules and pulls the U.S. from a global agreement to address climate change.Mr. Trump didn't lay out many new policy proposals, but instead focused more on broader promises aimed at making the nation energy independent and prioritizing U.S. workers over foreign ones. Reading from a teleprompter, he also renewed his call for a wall on the Mexican border and limiting trade alliances.Environmentalists panned Mr. Trump's speech, describing it as a wish list for fossil fuels. The speech ""reads like a love letter to big corporate polluters and a Dear John letter to our future,"" said Tom Steyer, a hedge fund billionaire turned climate activist who leads NextGen Climate, an advocacy group.---Janet Hook contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

Trump Rakes the Clinton Muck,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791555681?accountid=12768,"If the political class had a theme song, it would be that old Toby Keith tune, ""I Wanna Talk About Me."" Donald Trump knows the feeling, though of late he has been focusing on others. He wants to talk about Bill. He wants to talk about Hillary. He wants to talk about the 1990s, and Vince Foster, and Juanita Broaddrick.He wants to talk about things that could help him win an election.That Hillary Clinton today has a shot at the White House comes down to one reality: People forget. This is a politician utterly defined by scandal, and with more baggage than the carousels at Dulles International. She ought to be disqualified. And yet the Clintons thrive, the beneficiaries of forgetfulness. They've spent decades bulling through their messes, blaming their woes on right-wing plots, and depending on a fickle press and a busy nation to lose interest in their wretchedness. It works every time.Yet Mr. Trump has a way of disrupting the status quo. He does this in part by behaving in ways most politicians wouldn't or couldn't. Unlike Republicans who may be wary of resurrecting the Clinton past, for instance, Mr. Trump is not afraid of being labeled ""obsessive."" But there is usually a method to his madness. And his current let's-campaign-like-it's-1999 strategy has purpose -- it's part offense, part defense.On offensive, Mr. Trump's goal is to play off the soaring distrust Americans have in Mrs. Clinton by tying the past to the present. He wants voters to realize that the Whitewater land deal and Paula Jones aren't dusty, closed chapters in the Clintons' history. They are, rather, markers on a long continuum, one that begins with young Bill's draft-dodging and continues today with mature Hillary's private-email-server deletions and Clinton Foundation money-grubbing. And those scandals would accompany the Clintons back to the White House and define the next eight years, a prospect that Mr. Trump hopes will depress the entire nation.""[W]hether it's Whitewater or whether it's Vince or whether it's Benghazi. It's always a mess with Hillary,"" said Mr. Trump in a recent interview.The Clintons will claim that nobody cares. It's also possible that younger Americans -- some of whom were in diapers during the Clinton administration -- can't figure out why people are suddenly talking about blue dresses. Still, give Mr. Trump marks for doing more than any politician in recent memory to educate. The newspapers are suddenly brimming with synopses of Filegate, Chinagate, Travelgate, cattle futures, the Marc Rich pardon, Kathleen Willey and White House looting.Which is also part of the Trump offense: Energizing GOP base voters. Older Republicans in particular remain frustrated that the Clintons have never been held to account, and that the media so easily lost interest in the scandals. So to hear a Republican nominee take it to the Clintons -- and on the sort of bare-knuckle terms that only they understand -- is exciting.Mr. Trump's hits about the 1990s are also defensive moves, against what might otherwise be Mrs. Clinton's biggest strength -- the ""women's issue."" Democrats have used the ""war on women"" theme against Republicans for more than a decade, and for the most part successfully. Mrs. Clinton is already playing the women's card, accusing Mr. Trump of insulting women. His response goes like this: ""You want to talk about women? Awesome. Let's talk about Bill.""His ad on Instagram, featuring Bill Clinton chomping on a cigar, with the voices of women describing his unwanted sexual advances in the background, along with an ominous Hillary cackle, was a study in full-throttle bluntness.You can debate whether Mr. Trump, given his colorful past, has much of a leg to stand on here. But the point is that the Clintons are, if anything, worse. What's Hillary going to do? Defend Bill? That might not go over well with women, including survivors of sexual assault, who, Mrs. Clinton said last year, ""have the right to be heard . . . the right to be believed."" So far Mrs. Clinton has been forced to sit silent, gritting her teeth as the media run fresh interviews with Mrs. Broaddrick, who says that Mr. Clinton raped her in 1978 when he was the Arkansas attorney general.Mrs. Clinton now knows that attacking Mr. Trump about women will invite a counterattack from him citing Paula Jones, another of Bill's accusers. So perhaps Mrs. Clinton will lay off that front. Which is Mr. Trump's goal. He's playing for a draw on this issue.Does Mr. Trump's Bad Bill approach risk making Mrs. Clinton look like a victim? It might, if this were the 1990s, and she were still viewed as the victim of a philandering husband. But Hillary has spent the past 16 years embracing her womanizer, using his fame and fortune to bolster her presidential run. And this is the woman who, according to her longtime friend Diane Blair, railed that Monica Lewinsky was a ""narcissistic loony-tune."" It's hard to feel sorry for a woman willing to blame her husband's dishonor on a 22-year-old intern.What matters most about this Trump strategy is that it's a marker of what's to come. The Clintons play hardball. Mr. Trump intends to play smashball. For them, that's new.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",8/3/16
Robots for Trump (and Clinton),http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791555645?accountid=12768,"No matter what happens in November, one big winner has already emerged from the ruins of America's 2016 election: the robot. Both major candidates have embraced policies that will ensure the accelerating replacement of low-wage workers with no-wage workers.Under President Donald Trump, illegal immigrants and possibly even legal migrants will have a harder time finding work, meaning the businesses that now rely on their labor will turn to machines. Under President Hillary Clinton, a big increase in the minimum wage is certainly in the cards, in which case get used to ordering your Big Mac on a touch screen.At the same time, robotics is advancing technologically by leaps and bounds. Driverless cars are looking more and more like the future of the taxi industry, thus cutting off one of the typical routes to employment for immigrants. Truck-driving, meatpacking, fast-food preparation and hotel cleaning are ripe for automation as well.The robotics industry has so far concentrated on relatively high-end work -- vehicle-assembly systems or medicine. But the combination of the minimum-wage hikes in cities and states dominated by Democrats and new pressures on immigrant workers will create a set of incentives for the world's robot-builders. They will begin to concentrate their efforts on building new categories of affordable and reliable machines to replace what used to be called entry-level jobs.Medical robots have rapidly improved over the last decade, and systems that assist surgeons in complex operations such as spinal fusion are now common. In the near future autonomous robots will be able to perform simple procedures such as biopsies at a fraction of the cost of a fully manned operating room. From there the possibilities are endless: The technology needed to replace a hotel maid or a fast-food chef should be relatively simple.Since 9/11, the U.S. military has poured billions of dollars into robotics research. The benefits from that investment are beginning to reach the civilian world. Robots that can walk on four or two legs have been built and tested, and although they have not yet been approved for use on the battlefield, no one in the military doubts that soon such systems will be widespread.The societal effects of this robotics revolution are likely to be less benign than the results of the information revolution, but just as unstoppable. Young people will find it even harder to find entry-level jobs. Will unemployable youth turn to drugs and crime, or will they simply waste away in their parents' basements playing videogames?One already troubled government program, Social Security, could be devastated by the robotics revolution. If ever-fewer human workers are paying into the system while larger and larger numbers of seniors are getting benefits, bankruptcy seems inevitable. Unless we can tax the robots?---Mr. Dinerman writes on space policy and national security.Credit: By Taylor Dinerman",8/3/16
Election 2016: Hispanic Support Eludes Trump --- Mixed responses greet recent overtures by the presumptive GOP nominee,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1791223017?accountid=12768,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Donald Trump's criticism of the nation's first Latina governor threatens to further damage his image in the Hispanic community as he turns toward a general election where those voters will be pivotal.At a rally in Albuquerque on Tuesday night, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee pointed to a rise in food stamp recipients under New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, who heads the Republican Governors Association. ""She's gotta do a better job,"" he said.On Wednesday in Southern California, Mr. Trump invoked the name of a San Francisco woman killed last year by an illegal immigrant. ""Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!"" the crowd chanted.Protesters confronted police in riot gear and on horseback outside a Trump rally in Anaheim, Calif., on Wednesday. At least eight people were arrested, according to a police spokesman.Mr. Trump's appearances in two of the three states with the largest Hispanic electorates follow a few initial overtures to Hispanic voters in recent weeks that have drawn mixed results. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates a record 27.3 million Latinos will be eligible to vote in 2016 and would make up about 12% of the electorate, up from 10% in 2012.Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to questions about whether he planned to hire campaign staffers focused on Hispanic outreach to improve his large deficit with that group in polls.""I've never liked the pandering game, but I've never seen someone do it so antagonistically,"" said Republican state Rep. Rod Montoya of Farmington, who plans to vote in New Mexico's June 7 primary for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz even though he has dropped out of the race. Mr. Trump, he added, ""is not helping his cause.""At both rallies this week, Mr. Trump said his appeal is growing as Hispanic voters learn about plans to create jobs and prosperity. ""We're going to win with Hispanics,"" Mr. Trump told the ethnically diverse crowd of thousands at the Albuquerque Convention Center. ""They don't want their homes taken away and they don't want their jobs taken away.""But some Hispanic leaders say Mr. Trump first must apologize for branding Mexican immigrants as criminals in his campaign announcement and making other inflammatory remarks before they would be open to hearing his campaign agenda.Mrs. Martinez didn't attend the rally. Her spokesman, Mike Lonergan, said Wednesday ""the governor will not be bullied"" into backing him.On the Mexican holiday of Cinco de Mayo earlier this month, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter a picture of him eating a taco bowl and wrote, ""I love Hispanics."" This past weekend, he sent a video to a gathering of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference in which he said, ""National . . . Hispanic . . . Christian . . . three great words!""These gestures ""did not help, whatsoever,"" said the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the nation's largest Hispanic Christian group, which is nonpartisan.""If Donald Trump wants to redeem himself with Hispanic voters, he has to engage in a mea culpa for the demagoguery and hyperbole.""Mr. Trump has flagged illegal immigration as a pressing problem and said he would deport millions of undocumented workers and force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border.""He's not anti-immigrant. He's anti-illegal immigrant,"" said Dahlys Hamilton, who started an Atlanta-based group called Hispanic Patriots for Trump. She also belongs to the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. The group doesn't include any of the major Hispanic surrogates for Republican nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain or former President George W. Bush.""Hillary Clinton is a seasoned politician, and it will probably be a good idea for Trump to look to who would be respected in the Hispanic community to lean on,"" said Debe Campos-Fleenor, a Mexican-American insurance agent in Tucson, Ariz., who belongs to the pro-Trump coalition.So far, Hispanic voters have a very negative view of Mr. Trump, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey conducted this month shows. Some 68% would back Mrs. Clinton and 20% would back Mr. Trump if the two faced off in the general election, the survey found. Mrs. Clinton's 48-point advantage among Hispanics is far larger than her 3-point lead among voters overall in the survey.At the same time, Mrs. Clinton is also viewed less favorably by Hispanic voters than was her party's last nominee. The share of Hispanic voters who see her in a positive light is 7 points higher than the share with a negative view. By contrast, President Barack Obama was 35 points more positive than negative among Hispanic voters at this point in 2012.---Miriam Jordan contributed to this article.Credit: By Beth Reinhard",8/3/16
Election 2016 -- The Wall Street Journal / NBC News Poll: Clinton or Trump? Voters Say No,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790561271?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump share a defining asset that is fueling support for both in the 2016 presidential race: voters' animus toward the other candidate.More than half of registered voters in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll who said they plan to cast ballots for Mrs. Clinton this fall say their decision is more about opposing Mr. Trump than supporting the likely Democratic nominee. A slightly larger share of Trump backers says the same about their vote for the Republican candidate.That finding underscores just how discouraged many voters are about the likely choices in a general-election showdown that would pit the two least-popular presidential candidates in modern history in a race already defined by frustration and anger over the status quo.The WSJ/NBC News poll found Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump, 46% to 43%, among registered voters, down from her 11 percentage-point lead a month earlier. The race has grown tighter in large measure because Republicans are rallying around Mr. Trump.Clear dividing lines have emerged between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on what comes down to energy versus experience, the poll suggests.Mr. Trump starts with a lead over Mrs. Clinton on the question of who would do a better job in handling the economy, protecting the U.S. on trade and dealing with Wall Street. His biggest advantage comes on the question of who would do a better job ""changing business as usual in Washington,"" a key attribute in a year when 53% of those polled want the next president to bring major change to government.Mr. Trump's advantage on economic issues could give him a boost at a time when half of registered voters rank job creation and economic growth among their top-two issues and 61% say they are still feeling some impact from the recession that ended in 2009, including 69% of Trump supporters and roughly half of Clinton backers.Two-thirds of voters who want to see major changes in the way government operates favor Mr. Trump.Mrs. Clinton, in turn, wins a similar share of those voters who prefer a ""steady approach.""Overall, poll participants give Mrs. Clinton the edge on which candidate is looking out for the middle class, who would appoint the best Supreme Court justices and who would deal with issues of concern to women.The former secretary of state also has big advantages when it comes to foreign policy -- a potential liability for Mr. Trump -- with voters giving her higher marks at this early stage for being able to serve as commander-in-chief and the ability to navigate the world stage.The Democratic Party's biggest advantage down the stretch may be structural. President Barack Obama is enjoying a significant uptick in public approval during his final year in the White House, with 51% approving of the job he is doing, the highest tally since his second inauguration in January 2013.More of those surveyed want a Democrat than a Republican in the White House next year, and the Democratic Party has a much better image than the GOP.While both candidates have a negative public image among voters overall, nearly half of all registered voters think the results in November will make ""a great deal of difference"" in their daily lives.""The survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted May 15-19 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.It would be hard to overstate voter unease with the two likely nominees. Asked what words best describe a Clinton presidency, ""liar"" and ""not trustworthy"" were mentioned the most, while ""scared"" and ""disappointed"" were frequently associated with the idea of a President Trump.More voters expressed very negative views about Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton than they did about Russian President Vladimir Putin.""She's the lesser of two evils,"" said Cesar Saez, 26, of Las Vegas, who favors Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary but would back Mrs. Clinton in a matchup with Mr. Trump. ""She has a much better temperament than Donald Trump.""""It's not like that I like him, I just don't like her,"" said Charles Kafami, 36, of Fairfax, Va., referring to Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. ""I would vote for a can of Coke over her.""Some 48% of voters in the survey said they dislike Mr. Trump's approach and style and disagree with him on most issues, while 45% offered similar views about Mrs. Clinton. An additional 26% said they dislike Mr. Trump's style and approach but agree with him on the issues. Some 15% said so of Mrs. Clinton.More voters in the poll (38%) are indifferent about Mrs. Clinton becoming the first female president than those who express enthusiasm about that prospect (22%), while 16% of registered voters said it makes them uncomfortable.And the survey suggests Mr. Trump may need to calm concerns about his lack of experience, with 42% saying they are ""very uncomfortable"" that he would be the first president without previous government or military service. Another 19% express some reservations about that.---The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 respondents who use only a cellphone. It was conducted from May 15-19, 2016, by the polling organizations of Bill McInturff at Public Opinion Strategies and Fred Yang at Hart Research Associates. Individuals were selected proportionate to the nation's population in accordance with a probability sample design that gives all landline telephone numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance to be included. Registered voters age 18 or older were selected by a systematic procedure to provide a balance of respondents by sex. The cellphone sample was drawn from a list of cellphone users nationally. Of the 1,000 interviews, 450 respondents were reached on a cellphone and screened to ensure their cellphone was the only phone they had. In addition, 46 respondents were reached on a cellphone but reported also having a landline. Overall, the data's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The margin of error for subgroups is larger.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",8/3/16
"Main Street: Sex, Bill Clinton and Trump",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1790560377?accountid=12768,"Those of a certain age will recall the 1990s, the good old days when James Carville warned America that only ""an abusive, privacy-invading, sex-obsessed"" hypocrite could even think a president's personal behavior toward women had anything to say about his fitness for public office.Today it seems like ancient history, now that Donald Trump's treatment of women has become a political issue. True enough, there was a day when Americans would have blanched at the thought of a candidate bragging about his adultery or using a presidential debate to boast about his genitalia. But in the 1990s we learned that only bluenoses care about these things.We had it from no less than the Big Dawg himself. On Aug. 17, 1998, just hours after a grand jury session in which he'd tussled with prosecutors asking about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, he delivered a defiant, nationally televised address admitting his earlier denials had been misleading. Still, he insisted, whatever he had done with that young intern was between him and his family.""It's nobody's business but ours,"" he said. ""Even presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on with our national life.""Even perjury didn't matter in this case, because, as New York Congressman Jerrold Nadler put it, it was ""perjury regarding sex."" All that mattered was that Mr. Clinton was good at his day job.The American people seemed to agree, with a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll on the eve of the House vote to impeach showing only a third of the public in support.Here's the kicker: Donald Trump was on the Bill Clinton side of the argument.For Mr. Trump, this was all much ado about Monica. Mr. Clinton's mistake, he said, was that he'd lied about the sex instead of sticking with the argument it was irrelevant. In a September 1998 New York Times forum that ran under the headline ""Can Clinton Find the Road Back?"" Mr. Trump gave this advice:""Accept complete responsibility for personal failures, be lucky enough to have enemies with their own shortcomings, and hold steadfast to your political agenda. After the initial shock is past, the American people are less interested in sexual transgressions than they are in public achievements.""Nearly two decades later, Mr. Trump continues to live by this reading of the American people.This past week brings more evidence it's working. For no sooner had the New York Times published an expose subtitled ""How Donald Trump Behaved with Women in Private,"" than two women featured complained the Times had twisted their words to fit the reporters' negative narrative. So scarcely a week after it appeared, it is the Times story that has now blown up, not Mr. Trump.But if Mr. Trump is winning this fight, it's not just because the Times ought to have been more careful. It appears to have escaped the Hillary faithful that Mr. Trump may be winning in good part because he has proved a more steadfast adherent of the Clinton argument of the 1990s than she has.While at Wellesley, a young Hillary Clinton famously wrote her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky, the community organizer and author of ""Rules for Radicals."" The two kept up a correspondence after she entered law school at Yale, and Alinsky is said to have been a great influence on her thought.But while Mrs. Clinton may have studied Alinsky, Mr. Trump is showing himself the better Alinskyite. Especially with his use of Rule No. 4: Force your opponents to live up to their rules and values.There's no better example than the war on women. Mrs. Clinton started out all set to run the standard playbook against what she presumed would be a standard Republican opponent. But Mr. Trump has now turned it on her, putting her in the position of running against her husband.Whenever Mrs. Clinton brings up women, Mr. Trump throws Bill Clinton right back at her. Indeed, on Monday Mr. Trump released a new attack on Instagram featuring an audio of Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick over the caption: ""Is Hillary really protecting women?""Mr. Trump is doing all this, moreover, without the slightest apology for his own playboy boorishness. Think of him as Mr. Clinton minus the credible rape and harassment allegations.The difference is that where Bill lies, The Donald boasts. ""Beautiful, famous, successful, married,"" Mr. Trump wrote about women in his 2008 book ""Think Big."" ""I've had them all.""In the 1990s, when President Clinton found himself fighting for his presidency after he was caught in a sexual relationship with an intern, he and his allies relentlessly pushed the idea that a pol's private life was just that, private, and all that mattered was his agenda.These many years later, by choosing Mr. Trump, GOP primary voters have given their answer: Message received.Credit: By William McGurn",8/3/16
Trump Taj Mahal to Shut Down After Labor Day Weekend; Atlantic City casino to close after workers went on strike over benefits lost in bankruptcy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808427907?accountid=12768,"Atlantic City's Trump Taj Mahal casino will close at the end of the Labor Day weekend amid labor strife stirred by the last in a series of bankruptcies for the former gambling empire of Donald Trump.The Republican presidential nominee hasn't been involved in the management of the casino for years, but his name remains on the facade of the boardwalk property, which is owned by billionaire Carl Icahn .Represented by Unite Here Local 54, some 1,000 Trump Taj Mahal workers went on strike July 1 , asking for the restoration of health-care benefits lost in the company's most recent bankruptcy.In a statement, Tony Rodio, president and chief executive of Tropicana Entertainment Inc., which is also controlled by Mr. Icahn, blamed striking workers for the demise of the Taj.""Our directors cannot just allow the Taj to continue burning through tens of millions of dollars when the Union has single-handedly blocked any path to profitability,"" Mr. Rodio said. He declined through a spokeswoman to answer questions.Union chief Bob McDevitt criticized Mr. Icahn in a statement, likening the billionaire investor to a ""playground bully"" who would rather pick up his ball and go home than trying to reach an agreement with the casino's workers.""The great deal-maker would rather burn the Trump Taj Mahal down just so he can control the ashes,"" Mr. McDevitt said. ""For a few million bucks, he could have had labor peace and a content workforce, but instead he'd rather slam the door shut on these long-term workers just to punish them and attempt to break their strike.""After years of decline and casino closings, the Atlantic City gambling industry has started to stabilize. Earlier this summer, the casino workers' union reached new labor contracts with four other casinos, three owned by Caesars Entertainment Corp., as well as Mr. Icahn's Tropicana. But the union was unable to reach a new deal for the Trump Taj Mahal.At an average wage of less than $12 an hour, the Trump Taj Mahal workers are among the lowest-paid in Atlantic City, having lost their health-care benefits as well as other labor contract protections in bankruptcy.Mr. Icahn pledged to invest $100 million into the Trump Taj Mahal to get it in shape to compete, but dialed down the investment after the company left bankruptcy-court supervision .A spokeswoman for Mr. Icahn said Wednesday that he was unavailable for questions about the decision to close the Trump Taj Mahal on Labor Day.For more than a year before the picket lines went up, the relationship between union workers and the billionaire was marked by marches and protests in Atlantic City and New York, where Icahn Enterprises has its headquarters. Mr. Icahn has posted open letters on his website, questioning the honesty of union leadership.Opened by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 1990, the Trump Taj Mahal was the centerpiece of his gambling operation. By 2014, he sued to get his name off the casino and others in Atlantic City that later closed, fretting their tattered state would harm his brand.Write to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.comCredit: By Peg Brickley",8/4/16

Bernie Sanders.""I'm hearing we're going to get close to 40% of his supporters,"" Mr. Trump said at a recent campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M. ""The system is rigged against Bernie, so he can't win"" in the Democratic presidential primary. ""We're going to get tremendous numbers from Bernie Sanders.""But making that prediction come true would require an extraordinary amount of persuasion, if recent opinion polls and interviews with Sanders backers are any indication.""That's absurd,"" said Frank Pringle, 32 years old, a law student in Richmond, Calif., at a Sanders rally. ""He is living in a fantasy world.""Frank Gamboa, 39, an Uber driver from Alameda, Calif., who supports Mr. Sanders, is struggling with his general-election options, but said, ""I cannot in good conscience vote for Trump.""In Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls over the first four months of 2016, just 6% of Sanders supporters felt positively about Mr. Trump, while 90% felt negatively.

The other 17% of Sanders supporters said they would vote for neither candidate, another one, or weren't sure.If Mr. Trump wants to woo Sanders supporters, he will face the formidable obstacle of the Vermont senator's own virulent opposition to Mr. Trump's candidacy and calls for his backers to resist the temptation of Mr. Trump.""Donald Trump represents a whole lot that I passionately hate,"" Mr. Sanders said in an MSNBC interview this month. ""If I'm not the candidate, I will do everything that I can to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States.""The surprising rise of these two populist candidates has been a remarkable feature of the 2016 campaign, inviting comparisons between their appeals to angry voters.But the roots and goals of the Trump and Sanders phenomena are drastically different. Trump voters' anger is closely linked to frustration with Republican elites, and they tend to want government to dial back its role in social and economic problem solving. Sanders voters tend to think government should be more, not less, active in solving those problems.""The little guy has been getting left out in the cold my entire life,"" said Joe Marshall, 35, a Sanders supporter who works at the Joshua School for autistic children in Englewood, Colo. ""I happen to have more faith in the government's power to affect positive change in the world than a Donald Trump supporter.""Mr. Trump's attitude toward Mr. Sanders has been a moving target. He has coined the nickname ""Crazy Bernie."" He jokingly agreed to debate Mr. Sanders -- and then reneged on Friday. But more often than not, he seems to be wooing the senator's voters and treats Mr. Sanders with a gentler touch than he does other rivals.The Trump message may fall on more receptive ears among Sanders supporters whose antipathy toward Mrs. Clinton runs especially deep. Jordan Honeycutt, 24, an unemployed laborer in Kannapolis, N.C., said he would reluctantly pull the lever for Mr. Trump if he is the only alternative to Mrs. Clinton.""Anything but Clinton,"" Mr. Honeycutt said.Mr. Trump predicted that he would get ""tremendous"" support from millennials, the young voters who are a major bastion of Sanders voters. But the latest Journal/NBC News poll casts doubt on that prediction. Just 20% of voters aged 18 to 34 expressed positive feelings about Mr. Trump, while 71% felt unfavorably. In a head-to-head contest between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, he draws 32% of 18- to 34-year-olds, while she gets 55%.Mr. Sanders, who wasn't available for an interview, has rejected any comparison with Mr. Trump, and his stump speech includes a resolute slap at the New York businessman.Credit: By Janet Hook",8/4/16
Romney's Lonely Challenge to Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792507653?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsIn March, the Boston Globe published an interview in which Mitt Romney discussed his decision to publicly oppose Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. A Page One article Saturday about Mr. Romney said The Wall Street Journal's interview with him was his first in-depth discussion of the subject.(WSJ June 2, 2016)SAN DIEGO -- Mitt Romney's advisers begged him not to go to war with Donald Trump. After he decided to go ahead, Mr. Trump dismissed him as ""lightweight"" and ""failed candidate."" This week, Newt Gingrich called him ""pathetic.""Mr. Romney, sticking to his guns, has become a rare figure in American history -- a former presidential nominee openly defying the man succeeding him as his party's standard-bearer.Sitting at his home on the Pacific Ocean last week, Mr. Romney reflected on the waves he created by attacking Mr. Trump, how his family helped persuade him it was the right thing to do, and how he increasingly finds himself a voice in the wilderness.""Friends warned me, 'Don't speak out, stay out of the fray,' because criticizing Mr. Trump will only help him by giving him someone else to attack,"" Mr. Romney said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal -- the first time the 2012 GOP nominee discussed in depth his reasons for going after Mr. Trump.""They were right. I became his next target, and the incoming attacks have been constant and brutal."" He said he had no illusions he would alter Mr. Trump's progress toward the nomination or spark a meaningful independent candidacy.His motivation: ""I wanted my grandkids to see that I simply couldn't ignore what Mr. Trump was saying and doing, which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world.""Today, the GOP anti-Trump chorus is dwindling, leaving Mr. Romney among the few making the case publicly.Mr. Trump, in an interview on Wednesday, said of Mr. Romney: ""Once a choker, always a choker. I've got a store worth more than he is."" He said Mr. Romney's attack ""has nothing to do with his country. It has to do with me. I'm the one who forced him out"" of running in 2016.Former House Speaker Gingrich, referring to Mr. Romney in a Journal interview this week said: ""Having a guy like that go berserk in public makes you wonder what his problems are.""""He feels like the last lion,"" one Romney confidant said.Mr. Romney said he is acting on his own behalf and acknowledged many Republicans think his Trump attacks could help the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Still, he said, ""others, including myself, believe our first priority should be to stand by our principles and if those are in conflict with the nominee, the principles come first.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. Chief Executive Meg Whitman, who has known Mr. Romney for 25 years, said: ""Mitt's clarity about his position is helping others thinking about their patriotism and their country.""After losing in 2012 to President Barack Obama, the former Massachusetts governor and businessman moved on to what he called a ""balanced and full life."" He and his wife, Ann, who has multiple sclerosis, started the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases. For the 2014 midterm elections, he stumped for GOP candidates in 27 states.Mr. Romney, 69, wasn't worried when Mr. Trump joined the race in June, believing the 16 other Republicans made up a ""very capable, well-experienced, very deep field."" Along with other politicians, he expected the businessman to implode after he attacked illegal immigrants.On July 18, Mr. Trump said he wouldn't call Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee and a Vietnam prisoner of war, a ""war hero."" Mr. Romney and many of his 2012 staff, who were attending a pre-wedding event in Massachusetts for two staffers, saw their phones light up with Mr. Trump's comment: ""I like people who weren't captured.""Mr. Romney tweeted on the spot: ""Trump shot himself down. McCain and American veterans are true heroes.""As Mr. Trump surged ahead in debates, touting positions including a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the U.S., Mr. Romney held back in public. Instead, he called an adviser to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Lanhee Chen, and recommended Mr. Rubio hit Mr. Trump for not releasing his tax returns, Mr. Chen said. Mr. Rubio didn't oblige.After Mr. Trump's January second-place finish in Iowa to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Mr. Romney saw a chance to publicly confront the front-runner heading into the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary, said Stuart Stevens, his longtime political strategist.Political aides advised against it. ""Look at the imbalance of the volume of the microphone,"" Mr. Stevens said he told him. ""Trump can say something crazy and inflammatory against you and get nonstop coverage.""Another's advice, Mr. Romney recalled: ""It could hurt you and help him. Don't do it.""In early March, Mr. Romney said, he and his wife were getting ready for church when their son Tagg told them about Mr. Trump's refusal to disavow the endorsement of David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader. (Mr. Trump later attributed his ambiguous answer to a defective earpiece.)Mr. Romney tweeted: ""His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America.""Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's communications director, said: ""Mr. Trump has disavowed David Duke on every occasion.""Days later, Mr. Romney recalled, his son Josh, driving him to the Salt Lake City airport, inquired: ""When the grandkids ask 'What did you do to stop Donald Trump?' what are you going to say?'"" Tagg and Josh Romney, through a family spokeswoman, confirmed their father's accounts.On the plane, he began drafting a speech that he delivered March 3 to nationwide live coverage. He said Mr. Trump's policies could lead to recession and ""make America and the world less safe."" He tallied what he saw as the candidate's sins: dishonesty, bullying, greed, misogyny, ""absurd third-grade theatrics.""Mr. Trump fired back that day, contending Mr. Romney had begged for his endorsement for 2012. On Wednesday, he said: ""He shouldn't have accepted my money if he felt that way about me.""Mr. Romney's speech may have helped Trump rivals win in Utah and Wisconsin. Mr. Trump recovered and essentially locked up the nomination with his Indiana victory.Conservative stalwarts revived a push for a third-party candidate, with interest in Mr. Romney. ""I made it clear I'm not running,"" he said.On May 11, he again criticized Mr. Trump's failure to release his returns, calling his position ""disqualifying"" and implying his returns could have ""hidden inappropriate associations with foreign entities, criminal organizations, or other unsavory groups.""Ms. Hicks said: ""Mr. Trump is undergoing a routine audit. He will release his tax returns when the audit is complete.""Other anti-Trump forces were losing momentum. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Mr. Romney's 2012 running mate, pointedly hasn't endorsed Mr. Trump. After Mr. Ryan's May 12 meeting with the candidate, the Speaker said he was ""encouraged"" about their many agreed-upon principles.Mr. Trump revived his attack at an Anaheim, Calif., rally Wednesday, saying Mr. Romney ""chokes like a dog"" and ""walks like a penguin.""At his oceanfront home, Mr. Romney said he didn't expect to criticize Mr. Trump further but wouldn't rule it out.""I know that some people are offended that someone who lost and is the former nominee continues to speak, but that's how I can sleep at night,"" he said. ""And there are some people, though it's a small number, who still value my opinion.""Mr. Romney said he won't vote for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. ""Hopefully, I will find a name I can support,"" he said. ""If not, I will write in a name.""(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Is Romney's Criticism of Trump on Target?"" -- WSJ June 4, 2016)Credit: By Monica Langley",8/4/16
"Election 2016 -- Analysis: Trump, Clinton Both In Popularity Pickle",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792119334?accountid=12768,"By now, it is broadly accepted that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump generate a lot of negative vibes among voters. Less appreciated, perhaps, is how broad those bad vibes are, and how much they extend into segments of the electorate that normally would be more enthused.A look deeper into the sentiments of key electoral groups in the latestWall Street Journal/NBC News pollgives a fuller picture of just how unusual the public's views of the two parties' presumptive nominees really are. Mr. Trump generates more negative than positive feelings among groups usually sympathetic toward a Republican presidential contender, and Mrs. Clinton does the same among groups normally upbeat about a Democratic presidential front-runner.""I have never seen anything like this,"" says Bill McInturff, a veteran Republican pollster who conducts the Journal/NBC News survey with Democrat Fred Yang.In each Journal/NBC News poll, Americans are asked to rate their feelings toward a group of prominent figures as positive, negative or neutral. A lot of attention has been focused on the fact that, overall, those surveyed report net negative feelings toward each candidate, and by a wide margin. For Mrs. Clinton, 34% of respondents overall said they had positive feelings, while 54% said they had negative feelings. For Mr. Trump, the reading was even worse: 29% positive, 58% negative.Such readings might not be so bad for each candidate if the negative sentiment were all coming from groups that you would expect to be hostile to a Republican or a Democrat. The problem each has right now is that the bad vibes are coming in part from some groups that ought to be more positive.Mr. Trump, for example, has net positive ratings among Republicans by a 33-point margin -- though that is well below the 52-point net positive reading Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, had at this point. Mr. Trump also has a net 13-point positive rating among self-described conservatives, though again, that is almost 20 points lower than Mr. Romney had.The problem lies in the sentiments found in some groups that have been key for Republican contenders in recent cycles. His rating is a net negative of 28 points among suburban voters, 29 points among those in households with more than $75,000 in annual income, and a whopping 36 points among whites with a college education.For her part, Mrs. Clinton isnet positive among a handful of core groups: Democrats generally, self-described liberals, Latinos and black voters. Among African-Americans, her net positive is a healthy 63 points, though the same group gave President Barack Obama a net 89-point reading at this point in 2012.The problems for Mrs. Clinton lie elsewhere. Young voters aged 18 through 34, with whom she has struggled to gain ground against Sen. Bernie Sanders, give her a net negative rating of 21 points. Women age 50 or older are negative by 15 points, a reflection of the fact that Mrs. Clinton, though on her way to becoming the first female nominee of a major party, lags among married women. And self-described independent voters give her a net negative rating of 40 points. Mr. Obama had a net positive rating of 11 points in 2012.Still, there may be a silver lining in all those clouds for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. Their standing with such groups may be low now, but those also are audiences that should be open to revising their views toward the Democratic or Republican standard-bearer. And the two presumptive nominees have more than five months remaining before Election Day to make that happen.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",8/4/16
The Senate GOP's Trump Survival Plan,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792119283?accountid=12768,"Perhaps the only reason Donald Trump has a shot to win the White House is that his opponent is Hillary Clinton -- and vice versa. Both are viewed unfavorably by about three of five Americans, but voters must compare the two and select one. In the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 52% of Mrs. Clinton's supporters say their decision is more about defeating Mr. Trump than backing her, while some 54% of the businessman's voters say they mainly prefer for Mrs. Clinton to lose. America, in hoc anno Domini 2016.Now this dynamic is emerging as another unpredictable variable for the down-ballot candidates who share a ticket with the most-loathed presidential candidates in modern U.S. history. For Republican senators, the Trump-Clinton binary means their prospects in November aren't as dismal as many expected a couple months ago.This year always posed formidable challenges for the Senate GOP, and especially for the young and unusually talented freshman class of 2010. These incumbents were elected in swing states in the tea-party wave, and seven seats are up this year in states President Obama carried twice -- Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Iowa and Florida. Republicans are defending 24 seats versus 10 for the Democrats, and if Democrats add five they'll retake the majority -- four if Mrs. Clinton's vice president is the Senate tiebreaker.Earlier this year, endangered Republican incumbents feared a ""Trump effect."" The businessman trailed so badly in general-election polls that the GOP worried about another wave election that annihilated their Senate and even House majority. Democrats are proceeding on that assumption and assembling a ""Party of Trump"" campaign that will plaster the New Yorker's personal unpopularity and his more divisive eruptions onto every Republican.But at least so far, the Trump effect hasn't shown up in the polls. Mr. Trump has gained on Mrs. Clinton since securing the nomination in early May, though the Democratic nomination is still being contested. Most of the competitive Senate races have also tightened to a statistical dead heat.The most vulnerable Republican senators initially ducked and dodged when Mr. Trump won, almost as if they were in shock. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin tried to draw a semantic distinction between ""supporting"" the nominee and ""endorsing"" him, whatever that is supposed to mean. They've since settled on a more coherent strategy whose themes are self-reliance and independence. They'll run on their own political identities and try to showcase the interests of their states.As for Mr. Trump, these vulnerable GOP senators will try to distance themselves without alienating either the voters who like him or the ones who despise him. They need both groups to win. So: Criticize him on the merits when appropriate, issue by issue; try not to wander into the shrapnel of his day-to-day improvisations; and otherwise attempt to channel some of his energy to appeal to his voters without becoming a Chris Christie-like subsidiary of the Trump Organization.""Republican senators are talking to voters like they're running for sheriff. Every message is highly targeted and purposefully local,"" National Republican Senatorial Committee Director Ward Baker wrote in an essay on Medium this week. ""We want to make sure voters are casting votes for Senate candidates based solely on issues related to that Senate race -- not up, down or adjacent on the ticket.""Thus Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania has been spotlighting safety and public-order issues that resonate in the counties around Philadelphia, like law enforcement under attack and sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. Ms. Ayotte talks about heroin and opiate abuse, and Mr. Johnson features regulatory reforms that could help Wisconsin's manufacturers and increase incomes.Sometimes they stake out turf on Trump topics consistent with their principles, as Rob Portman has in Ohio on trade and Chinese currency manipulation. The Veterans Affairs crisis is a no-brainer for everybody.In a political year dominated by Mr. Trump, parochializing Senate races won't be easy. Mr. Toomey wrote in a May 9 op-ed for the Philadelphia Inquirer that Mr. Trump's ""vulgarity, particularly toward women, is appalling. His lack of appreciation for Constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning,"" and his list kept going. But Mr. Toomey later said he was impressed by Mr. Trump's roster of potential Supreme Court nominees to replace Antonin Scalia. His Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, has continued to invoke the ""Toomey-Trump team.""The Trump campaign has blessed the GOP independence strategy, though given Mr. Trump's volatility this safe space may be perishable. But will voters credit the senators for their differences with Mr. Trump? Voters didn't extend that courtesy to centrist Democrats in conservative states in 2014, when nine seats flipped, despite their attempts to separate themselves from President Obama's policies and record.Another problem for the Republicans this year could be the trend away from split-ticket voting, when people cast ballots for one party for president and another for Congress. Among the states holding Senate races in 2012, one in five split their ticket, according to the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. In 1984 and 1988, the figure was one in two.Campaign operatives point to 1996 as a model, when the GOP picked up two seats despite the landslide against Bob Dole: In the last month of the campaign when hope was lost, the GOP prioritized congressional triage. Mr. Trump could perform better than Mr. Dole, and in that case polarization could work to the benefit of the down-ballot candidate. Straight party-line voting helps explain why Mr. Trump's numbers among Republicans have recovered so quickly.The contradiction is that as the senators minimize national politics, they could forfeit an equivalent claim on voter support. Presumably more is at stake politically this year than picking a sheriff.But if Mr. Trump's polls do crash, the senators hope that their states give them the benefit of the doubt. The sui generis nature of his candidacy, with no real precedent, could inspire discrete decisions at the ballot box that would be less likely with a more conventional Republican nominee.Republicans can also claim to be genuinely independent actors in a way that Democrats couldn't in 2014. In the 113th Congress, Majority Leader Harry Reid ruthlessly enforced party discipline and blocked amendments to prevent Republicans from forcing Democrats to take difficult votes. The problem was that he denied members of his caucus the opportunity to define their own political character.Mitch McConnell, the current majority leader, is calculating but he isn't a central planner. Opening up the Senate to debate has allowed Republicans to show how they're different. Ms. Ayotte, for example, can point to the addiction-treatment and child-care block-grant bills she worked with Democrats to help pass. Such coalition-building never happened in Mr. Reid's Senate.The Supreme Court may be another advantage. People who recoil from Mr. Trump may not be inclined to hand Mrs. Clinton liberal control of the bench for a generation. Divided government could result in more moderate judicial picks, and a firewall against Mrs. Clinton's liberal excesses.The vulnerable Republicans are also well-liked in their state parties, winning their primaries with more than 60% of the vote. No Republican incumbent in the Senate or House has lost a primary this year.Mr. Trump is also generating a financial windfall for GOP senators. Traditional donors are warming to him, but some are refusing and others haven't been approached. They'll invest instead in the Senate as an insurance policy. The candidates in the five costliest races have raised about $120 million through April, almost twice as much as the five costliest races in 2012 at the same point.The most vulnerable incumbent is Mark Kirk of Illinois, which Mr. Obama carried by 16 points in 2012. Mr. Kirk is stressing his social moderation more than his fiscal conservatism, but like other Senate Republicans he faces a flawed opponent. Rep. Tammy Duckworth has an August court date in a civil lawsuit over workplace retaliation when she ran the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs.Ms. McGinty of Pennsylvania, a former environmental adviser to Al Gore and aide to Gov. Tom Wolf, has never held elective office. Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland's 2007-11 economic record includes the loss of 350,000 jobs and depleting the state's rainy-day fund to 89 cents -- despite a big tax increase.Wisconsin's Mr. Johnson once trailed former Sen. Russ Feingold by double digits, but this spring he closed the gap. Though he is about five points down, he will benefit from the support of Gov. Scott Walker's machine and arguably the strongest state Republican Party in the country.The one Senate race where a Trump effect may be materializing is in Arizona, which GOP presidential candidates have carried in 15 of the 16 cycles since 1952. The Real Clear Politics polling average gives Mrs. Clinton a one-point lead. John McCain, standing for his sixth term, is only 2.4 points ahead of his likely challenger, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. Mr. McCain -- who ran for president twice -- has taken to calling 2016 ""the race of my life.""Ward Baker's National Republican Senatorial Committee will try to overcome such challenges with get-out-the-vote targeting and analytics, and his outfit is tech-savvy and sophisticated. Yet the reality is that wave elections always overwhelm such campaign basics, however well-planned, and as early as September 2015 Mr. Baker wrote a clear-eyed memo telling candidates to start preparing for the possibility of a Trump effect that upends ""the established political order.""But another possibility is the flip side of the Trump effect: the Clinton effect. If the businessman does turn out to be an albatross for Republicans, Mrs. Clinton could be some other species of large sea bird for Democrats.Mrs. Clinton isn't as much of a liability as Mr. Trump so far, but all the Democratic Senate candidates are uncritical Hillary disciples. Republicans who are more circumspect about their nominee will try to exploit this asymmetry and connect her negative image to their opponents. Especially if Mrs. Clinton runs a generic and complacent anti-Trump campaign that takes his presidential unfitness for granted, the GOP hope is that the presidential unpopularity contest becomes self-cancelling.And if it doesn't? The irony will be that Mr. Trump, the political outsider, will have obliterated the Senate's most effective outsiders. No senator more dedicated to free markets will be elected from Pennsylvania than Mr. Toomey, no sturdier voice on national security from New Hampshire than Ms. Ayotte, no greater foe of government dysfunction from Wisconsin than Mr. Johnson. The Senate races expose the risks the GOP took in nominating Mr. Trump, but also why the senators aren't ready to start panicking -- yet.---Mr. Rago is a member of the Journal's editorial board.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Voting or Not Voting Based On One's Moral Principles"" -- WSJ June 4, 2016)Credit: By Joseph Rago",8/4/16

Mr. Trump's campaign has said it plans to raise a similar amount.Only a fraction of the $6 million will be deposited directly into Mr. Trump's campaign, in accordance with federal campaign-finance donation limits and a joint fundraising agreement he finalized with the RNC last week.Mr. Trump's campaign can accept up to $5,400 per donor for his primary and general elections. The joint committee, called Trump Victory, can accept up to $449,400 per donor, most of which will be transferred to the RNC. The fundraiser also garnered another $4 million in pledges to donate in the future, the person said.Mr. Trump largely self-funded his primary campaign, but he said earlier this month that he wouldn't do so for the general election. On top of his self-funding, he raised nearly $14 million through April, according to his Federal Election Commission filing. Mrs. Clinton raised $213 million over that period.While presidential candidates have often raised money jointly with the party, those funds usually come on top of money raised directly for the campaign. In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney raised nearly $493 million for his joint fundraising committee with the RNC, on top of $336 million directly for his campaign.The Trump fundraiser was held Wednesday evening at the Santa Monica home of Rachelle and Tom Barrack, the founder and chief executive of Colony Capital Inc., a Los Angeles-based investment firm with holdings across real estate and entertainment, and a longtime friend and business partner of Mr. Trump. More than 100 donors gathered to hear Mr. Trump and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus speak.Attending the dinner and reception and taking a photo with Mr. Trump cost $25,000 a person, according to a copy of the invitation viewed by The Wall Street Journal. To be a member of the event's host committee and attend the dinner and reception -- among other perks -- donors paid $100,000. Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's national finance chairman, said the event had 18 hosts. Several donors at the event gave the maximum $449,400.Attendees at the fundraiser represented various industries, including finance, real estate, entertainment and Silicon Valley, according to one person who attended. Actor Jon Voight, who has said in interviews he supports Mr. Trump's candidacy, also attended.Mr. Trump struck a casual tone that departed from his more aggressive style at massive campaign rallies, an attendee said. He mingled with guests, delivered a speech and answered questions about topics that included trade and immigration. Mr. Trump arrived at 7 p.m. and stayed until about 10:30 p.m.The candidate didn't discuss political strategy in the election at the fundraiser, but instead he talked about campaign issues and told personal stories, the attendee said.On Tuesday, the Trump campaign held a reception in Albuquerque, N.M., attended by about 20 people, said one donor who was there.Earlier this week, the campaign and the RNC rolled out a list of donors who will work on behalf of a joint fundraising committee.The list included Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets football team and former finance chairman for Jeb Bush's presidential campaign; Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks; and Florida developer and former Bush backer Mel Sembler.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus and Erich Schwartzel",8/4/16

Median real household income has dived by 17% since 2000 to $22,962, and two-thirds of local kids live in poverty.Mr. Owens notes these are the familiar ""challenges you see in urban America"" that nonetheless stand out ""for a city and a population that's so small."" Across the street from the Greater Praise sanctuary is a vacant lot and a boarded-up building that used to house several businesses.The paradox, or the tragedy, is that there are tens of thousands of unfilled manufacturing and other entry-level positions in Wisconsin. Seven of 10 state CEOs had trouble finding enough qualified workers, the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce trade group found in a July survey, and demand is rising.To try to resolve this mismatch between potential workers and the businesses that want to hire them, Mr. Owens and Pastor Smith last year started a partnership called the Joseph Project that has already seen some early notable successes. They've also got an unlikely partner--Ron Johnson, Wisconsin's Republican senator.Pastor Smith first met Mr. Owens when Mr. Owens was with the state GOP, which he left to join Mr. Johnson's staff. ""I get a call, and I'm like, OK, who's Ron Johnson? Well, you know, he's a U.S. senator. I said, oh, you mean Tammy Baldwin?"" Pastor Smith recalled, laughing, in an interview this week at Greater Praise.If humanitarianism to mitigate concentrated poverty is unusual for a conventional Republican--at least according to the political caricature--then Mr. Johnson's party affiliation may also be a liability as he runs for a second term in the era of Donald Trump. The Wisconsin Senate campaign spotlights the larger importance of 2016, and Mr. Johnson could be caught in an anti-Trump downdraft.The senator and former plastics-making executive isn't one to put an extra brush of varnish on a situation. Yet in an interview at his campaign headquarters in Waukesha, he says the Joseph Project is far more meaningful than mere politics: ""It is a joy, being able to participate in that, seeing people's lives be turned around. That's true conservative values and they work. You outsource compassion to the federal government, that doesn't work so good. You show your compassion here in your community, one person at a time.""The Joseph Project began amid a confluence: Mr. Johnson was traveling around Wisconsin, and, he says, ""not one manufacturer could hire enough people. But we've got all this inner-city unemployment, guys, how can you make that connection?"" Meanwhile, Pastor Smith and Mr. Owens heard an appeal from the Sheboygan County Economic Development Corp., which was trying to fill 4,000 factory jobs. They made a tour of companies like Nemak (auto parts), Pace (aluminum die casting), Kohler (bathroom fixtures) and Johnsonville (sausage).Sheboygan County is more than an hour's drive north of Milwaukee, and already on the ride back Mr. Owens and Pastor Smith were formulating a plan. They drew on the insights of the black conservative intellectual Bob Woodson, who in his 2007 book ""The Triumphs of Joseph"" chronicled ""local people finding local solutions to their local needs in their communities. These were not big-name organizations and big-name foundations; these were small ministries, small nonprofits started in someone's church, started in someone's attic, and they went out and did the work,"" Mr. Owens says.The duo figured they could connect unemployed or underemployed Milwaukeeans with the Sheboygan companies and use church vans that were unused during the workweek for transportation. They devised a week-long curriculum of workshops, taught by church members and Mr. Johnson's Senate staff as a constituent service. The workshops focused on ""soft skills,"" like how to interview, the work ethic, financial and time management, and conflict resolution, Mr. Owens says. ""We're not teaching them how to weld, how to type--""""The simple things,"" says Pastor Smith.Admittance to the Joseph Project is competitive, and Mr. Owens and Pastor Smith set high expectations and vet candidates. Those who persevere are promised an interview with an HR department on Friday, nothing more.Fifteen people took part in the first class in October 2015, and 13 were offered a job and began work. Of the 130 people who have completed the program, 77 are now working with another 28 offers pending. Wages are well above the minimum, running between $12.80 and $18.50 an hour, and the vans run five shifts a day and average 12,000 miles a month.Economically speaking, the Joseph Project removes friction from the labor market and solves a human-capital problem for employers. Since the best type of skills training happens on the job, for workers the program helps break ""the cycle of poverty and despair,"" as Mr. Johnson puts it.The project also has better recruiting and retention outcomes than the notorious archipelago of federal job training. Before a modest 2014 reform, there were 47 overlapping such programs. The Government Accountability Office found that only five could show any positive effects, and even those were ""small, inconclusive or restricted to short-term impacts.""""Some of them go as far as giving you a really nice certificate of completion and attached to that pretty certificate is a piece of paper with a bunch of companies' names on it,"" says Pastor Smith. ""You can get that out of the Yellow Pages. That has no value, you know what I mean?""Relationships--that's where the value is, and that's what we do, and that's what sets us apart,"" he says. Companies over time are coming to trust applicants with the Joseph Project imprimatur. Mr. Johnson's involvement includes helping to broker these relationships--17 companies now participate.Mr. Johnson's endorsement, in turn, has encouraged companies to show case-by-case flexibility on criminal backgrounds. A 2007 University of Wisconsin study found that by age 30-34 only 38% of men in 53206 had not spent time in a state correctional facility. ""Are the owners of these companies willing to say, let's give this guy another shot?"" Mr. Owens asks. ""He said he wants to work. He has the same probationary period like everybody else. . . . He may have some bumps and some bruises. But what you've got are some tough-minded, gritty people who will not give up, who will not tap out easily. They've been through challenges before, they see the opportunity and go for it.""""Almost all these individuals are in a position where they've got to put their pasts behind them and move forward,"" explains Mr. Johnson. ""Probably for the first time in his life not only does he have the dignity of earning his own success, but he has that added dignity and joy of doing something that's going to benefit somebody he doesn't even know.""Because success builds on success, the faith-based program teaches a sense of spiritual solidarity. ""The Joseph Project is really bigger than just you,"" Mr. Owens says. ""It's really about the next person behind you, keeping the door open for the next person behind you.""Pastor Smith adds: ""The Joseph Project is making impacts on people's lives. Because there is a thing called the Joseph Project, because of all the hard work that the senator is putting in, because of the people behind the scenes, that the church does, guess what: Somebody is going to eat tonight.""***""Of all the stuff I've done in six years, if nothing else, this was worth it,"" Mr. Johnson says of the Joseph Project. ""I'm telling you, this [running for re-election] is such a negative process. It is: the frustration and not being able to get stuff done and the negative campaigning, the way they try to destroy your character. This was worth it.""This election may test Mr. Johnson's proposition, and among Republican political analysts the race inspires ambient dread. He's probably the most vulnerable GOP senator after Illinois's Mark Kirk. Democrats need to retake four seats to control the now 54-46 chamber if Hillary Clinton wins the White House.Mr. Johnson was elected in the 2010 tea-party wave, defeating 18-year incumbent Russ Feingold in one of that year's biggest upsets. Now Mr. Feingold is back, and presidential election years tend to bring out Democrat-leaning voters in Wisconsin. The last Republican to win the state was Ronald Reagan in 1984. Then again, no ousted senator has won a direct re-match since 1934.Democrats are trying to wrap Mr. Trump around Mr. Johnson like a boa constrictor, and the New Yorker is exceptionally unpopular in the Badger State. In the Marquette University poll released this week, he's viewed favorably by 27% of registered voters. In the same poll, Mr. Feingold is beating Mr. Johnson, 49% to 43%.But the race has narrowed in recent months, and Mr. Johnson is running as an independent, pragmatic outsider keyed in on solving problems particular to Wisconsinites. He supports Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton. ""Some people you disagree with more than others, but my approach really throughout my life, throughout my business career: I concentrate on the areas of agreement. It's far more productive,"" Mr. Johnson says.He raised $2.8 million in the most recent quarter, which puts him in a top-three league with the GOP fundraising powerhouses Rob Portman and Pat Toomey, and he portrays Mr. Feingold as a career politician whose ambition to return to Washington is a little unseemly. ""This is no different from 2010. I knew I was down. Ended up winning by five,"" Mr. Johnson notes.""When I get in front of people, I can convince them. I think they see my true intentions here, which is to solve these problems. I'm not doing this because I want to be a U.S. senator . . . Truth of the matter, I'd rather go home. Who wouldn't? Well, Russ Feingold. What normal person? I miss my old life. This is a grind, but it's an important grind. I know there aren't enough people in Washington, D.C., who aren't worried about their re-election.""Standing in the Greater Praise parking lot, Orlando Owens loops his forefinger around in the air and notes that, whatever you say about Republicans, Ron Johnson isn't the author of this. The first-term senator didn't board up the businesses, or cause the bad schools, the violence or the lack of economic opportunity. But he's trying to work his way to a better answer than the liberal Milwaukee status quo of Russ Feingold and all the Democratic aldermen and county executives. He deserves more time, Mr. Owens says.The greatest political misfortune of 2016 may have nothing to do with the White House. It will be if Mr. Trump takes decent men like Mr. Johnson down with him as collateral damage.Mr. Rago is a member of the Journal's editorial board.Related Articles* Trump Can't Break the Republican Party* Trump by Those Who Know Him Best* The Senate GOP's Trump Survival PlanCredit: By Joseph Rago",8/15/16
Trump and Clinton Will Go Down in History--For a While; Politicians think the White House brings immortality. But the world has already forgotten President Hayes.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810982091?accountid=12768,"Somewhere in America, just after 2 o'clock on a steamy summer afternoon, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were out making their rounds, seeking to become a permanent part of the nation's history. On East William Street in Delaware, Ohio, I was the only person in front of the BP gas station, looking toward a small patch of dirt and sparse foliage.Near the gas pumps, a Bud Light delivery truck had just parked. Its driver, on foot, noisily wheeled some silver-colored kegs of beer past where I stood. Traffic on William Street was fairly heavy, but as far as I could tell not a single motorist glanced over toward the object that had caught my eye.""Very few people even realize it's here,"" the owner of the gas station, Jean Khanjian, told me. ""I don't think it has any effect on our business, either way.""What I was looking at was a weathered plaque declaring that the spot where the pumps stand ($2.05 a gallon on this Midwestern day) was the birthplace of Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States. It has been almost a hundred years since the house where his mother gave birth to him--his father had died during her pregnancy--was torn down.All the frenzied striving by a different crop of candidates every four years for the enduring eminence that comes with the presidency, all the time and hope put into overcoming the odds that will keep all but one from making it to the White House--all of it, as we're seeing this summer, is so perpetually present-tense and seemingly urgent. And yet. . .The Upper Cut barber shop was next door, a pizza place called Amato's diagonally across the street. There was a black rubber hose snaked around the base of the plaque, which has been here since 1926 through a succession of different gas-station proprietors. No water emerged from the mouth of the hose, and some of the dirt had cracked in the heat.Only 400 or so people lived in Delaware in 1822, when the baby was born to his just-widowed mother. Hayes is not a president about whom many people give much thought these days. He served a single term, from 1877 to 1881, preceded by Ulysses S. Grant and succeeded by James A. Garfield. But still, when a president comes from a small town, you might think his birthplace would be commemorated in grander fashion.""Indeed,"" the head of the Delaware County Historical Society, Brent Carson, told me when I sought him out. ""It's not really befitting of a president of the United States. There's not even a place on the street for a car to park so a driver can get out."" Is there any presidential birthplace in the U.S. marked as modestly as this one at the gas station? ""I can't imagine,"" Mr. Carson said.The cable newscasts on this afternoon were wall-to-wall with reports about Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton and their parallel quests to become the 45th president. One day the place where one of them was born will become a draw for sightseers, part of the immortality that automatically accompanies victory.""We're proud that a president was born here,"" said R. Thomas Homan, the city manager of Delaware. ""But is that gas station a destination for tourists? I would have to say no.""Not that the town is indifferent. Last year a committee was set up to devise a more proper tribute to President Hayes. The chairman of the committee was an 18-year-old senior at Rutherford B. Hayes High School, Cory Beam, who told me that he gave up playing varsity baseball this spring--he was a starting pitcher--to work on the project.""The plaque's not even legible anymore,"" he said. ""You can hardly read it. People walk by like it's not even there. That's not the way a president from your town should be remembered.""Mr. Beam--he's leaving Delaware to go to college this fall--and his committee recently presented a plan to the city's leaders. If funding can be found, a statue of Rutherford B. Hayes would be erected in a plaza that would be designed nearby, with a fountain and a place for visitors to sit. Although the plaza would not be on the precise site where Hayes was born, the statue's eyes would be looking directly at the BP station where the house once stood.On this afternoon a woman gassed up her gray Toyota Camry. With a dog in her back seat she turned left onto William Street. She accelerated first past the plaque and then past St. Mark's Lutheran Church, and there is, in the end, an unexpected sort of grandeur to this place. It is the indisputable affirmation of an American truth. The old promise is real:From a spot like this one, all the way to the White House. You can get there from here.Mr. Greene's books include ""Chevrolet Summers, Dairy Queen Nights"" (Harper Perennial, 2001).Related Articles* Trump Runs Against Both Parties* Hillary's Latest 'Old News'* The Glass-Steagall-Trump-Clinton ActCredit: By Bob Greene",8/15/16

Trump's MAD,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793066375?accountid=12768,"Is Donald Trump trapped inside his persona?Keeping up with Mr. Trump's statements takes some doing, but one thing he said last week, after he had attacked Republican Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, stood out.""If I was nice to everybody,"" he told a crowd later that day in Anaheim, Calif., ""I wouldn't be here today. I'd be watching television right now.""Mr. Trump believes, correctly, that this persona brought him from his entry into the race last June to the GOP nomination now. It gave him one good year.But his assertions this week that he won't change, that he will continue to attack any Republican ""that is not on my side,"" sounded oddly inadequate to the magnitude of the contest ahead. His public persona is starting to look like a comfortable but self-limiting security blanket.Last week began very well for Donald Trump, if by ""well"" one means something bad happening to the myriad individuals and forces presumably arrayed against him. The State Department's Inspector General released a scathing report on Hillary Clinton and the private email system she devised as secretary of state.This being the year that God sentenced us to live with compulsive candidates, Mrs. Clinton's was to offer preposterous defenses, such as, she wasn't used to checking her emails on a PC. Even the liberal punditocracy was merciless.Lucky also for Mr. Trump, the polls hit Hillary in her bad week with the news that she and her Republican opponent are now in a statistical dead heat among national voters.Anywhere else in political history, back to Julius Caesar, 99.9% of political candidates would have stood back and let their opponent bleed in public. Instead, Mr. Trump, the outlier of all time, stanched the bleeding of Mrs. Clinton's week on Friday by attacking, with extraordinary and extended virulence, the federal judge presiding over the formerly obscure Trump University lawsuit.He called Indiana-born Judge Gonzalo Curiel ""Mexican"" and ""a hater of Donald Trump,"" adding that ""I think Judge Curiel should be ashamed of himself.""And so at the low point so far in Mrs. Clinton's campaign, Mr. Trump redirected the media's pitiless glare away from her and back to him.Politically, this is madness. But I think it is worth distinguishing between two Trump personas: the mad Trump and the MAD Trump.MAD is an acronym for mutually assured destruction, a Cold War strategic theory which held that if the Soviet Union launched a thermonuclear ballistic-missile attack on the United States, the U.S. would reply in kind, assuring mutual annihilation.MAD Trump is the shrewd, ruthless politician who threatens Hillary and Bill Clinton and everyone inside the Clinton tong with destruction if they or their surrogates attack him personally.Mr. Trump launched his MAD strategy after Mrs. Clinton's stump speech started to say that he isn't ""fit"" to be president and that he abuses womanhood. Translation: The Clintons' famous opposition-research trolls would dump more mud on Mr. Trump after the conventions.Mr. Trump escalated immediately with an ad resurrecting Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of rape, and, after that, the murk of the Clintons' much-investigated Arkansas land deal known as Whitewater.At this, the white-shoe press began to gag. How dare Donald Trump revive all these awful, ""settled"" memories of the Clinton presidency?He dares because his opponent is Hillary Clinton. Of all the Democrats the party could have put forward, she is the only one with political, financial and personal baggage -- going back 30 years -- equal to whatever vulnerabilities Donald Trump has in his past. Mutually assured destruction.Voters, however, may find it hard to distinguish between that Trump and the mad Trump who used his appearance in Albuquerque, N.M., to mock the state's widely admired governor, Ms. Martinez (""Hey! Maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico"").Mr. Trump argues that if he didn't do this sort of thing, he'd be home watching television. But if he keeps doing it, he still may get his chance to watch a lot of television.It isn't just Mr. Trump's compulsive urge to attack Republicans Jeb Bush, Nikki Haley, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and the rest of them. It's what comes after. Politics is about large networks. When Donald Trump attacks one of these individuals so publicly, the aftershocks radiate outward across connected webs of loyalists and fundraisers.Susana Martinez is chairwoman of the Republican Governors Association. Its members include GOP governors in at least seven important battleground states. Mr. Trump needs their states' political machinery. Holding a Susana Martinez up to public ridicule is fun for him but increasingly dangerous. In politics, payback can come from innumerable places, and in ways you will never see.Against this, Donald Trump seems to be betting that he's the first truly realized media-age candidate.

Election 2016: Proposed Trump Rival Fails To Appeal,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793065932?accountid=12768,"Republican political donors and strategists seeking a conservative alternative to Donald Trump in the presidential race aren't rallying to the latest proposed candidate, Tennessee lawyer David French, according to people familiar with talks to recruit another contender.Conservative activist Erick Erickson, a Trump critic, said on his radio show Wednesday that Mr. French -- so unknown he didn't have a Wikipedia page until Tuesday -- isn't the answer because he can't raise enough money to be competitive and would give Mr. Trump a scapegoat if he loses the general election.""If there is a viable third-party candidate on the ballot in a handful of states, it gives [Mr. Trump] somebody to blame"" if he loses, Mr. Erickson said.Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman who backed the Jeb Bush and John Kasich campaigns for the nomination, also said Mr. French doesn't measure up to the other candidates whom Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, has tried to recruit, including 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse.""By putting out the names Sasse and Romney, [Mr. Kristol] set the bar a little higher,"" said Mr. Weber. ""So David French, who is a perfectly fine, distinguished guy, looks pretty small compared to what he had thought was coming.""Mr. French, an Iraq war veteran who serves as the treasurer of his three children's Christian school and has written scathing commentary about Mr. Trump in National Review, hasn't committed to run. He didn't respond to messages Wednesday.Mr. Kristol, according to his social-media posts, is traveling in Israel this week. He also didn't respond to messages Wednesday.Mr. Romney, on Twitter, praised Mr. French. ""I know David French to be an honorable, intelligent and patriotic person. I look forward to following what he has to say,"" Mr. Romney said.The barriers to any third-party candidate at this stage in the campaign are significant. The deadline to appear on the ballot in Texas, which will award 38 electoral votes, has already passed. North Carolina has a June 9 deadline, and a candidate would need to 89,366 signatures to get on the ballot there. In California, the most populous state, and Florida, a battleground, over 100,000 signatures are needed.June deadlines also are approaching in Illinois, Indiana, New Mexico and North Carolina, and campaigns usually invest thousands of hours in gathering signatures. A candidate entering the race this late would need millions of dollars just to play catch-up.Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg considered an independent run but pulled the plug in March, when his aides determined he would have needed to start by then to ensure ballot access.""Like everything else conservatives have tried to stop Trump, this latest iteration is about two steps behind,"" said Josh Putnam, a lecturer at the University of Georgia who runs Frontloading HQ, a website covering campaign deadlines and election rules. ""Ideally, the groundwork for something like this would have been laid in late 2015.""While the hurdles are high, there is some appetite for an independent or third-party candidate. Some 47% of registered voters said they would consider such a candidate, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in May, compared with 50% who wouldn't consider one.Credit: By Reid J.

Election 2016: Labor Fears Partisan Defections --- Union leaders mobilize to try to counteract Trump's appeal to the white working class,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793064864?accountid=12768,"Labor leaders are nervous about Donald Trump's appeal to unions' many white, working-class members, and they are working to head off partisan defections.Unions spend heavily to support Democrats in elections and wield great influence over whether their members support those candidates. But labor leaders fear many of their members could be drawn to Mr. Trump. Merged Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling data from the first four months of the year show that among white union households, support is split evenly between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, at 44% each, in a potential general-election matchup.""Everybody recognizes the enormous threat Trump poses"" whether their unions have backed either Democratic candidate, Bernie Sanders or Mrs. Clinton, said Robert Master, the Eastern region political director for the Communications Workers of America, which has endorsed Mr. Sanders. ""There's an element in that right-wing populism that is appealing to some of our members, there's no question about that,"" Mr. Master said.The AFL-CIO is preparing an education campaign to highlight some of Mr. Trump's statements -- such as that wages are too high -- and lesser-known things about how he has run his businesses and treated employees, said Mike Podhorzer, political director of the nation's largest federation of labor unions.Last week, the AFL-CIO began its on-the-ground program in battleground states including Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada. It is distributing fliers at members' workplaces and homes and is making them available to its affiliate unions and local chapters in every state.Part of the campaign is rooted in a round of focus groups the AFL-CIO conducted in recent weeks in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati -- both cities in states where the percentage of workers in unions outstrips the national rate of 11.1%. The groups consisted of union members who weren't strongly for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton but were considering voting for the Republican. Most participants were registered as independents.When the participants learned things about Mr. Trump, such as his support for so-called right-to-work laws that can weaken unions, ""it changed the prism that they were looking at the election through, from being this popular entertainment game show to 'this is really going to affect my life,'"" Mr. Podhorzer said.Mr. Trump has more recently voiced support for raising the minimum wage, and Corey Lewandowski, his campaign manager, said Mrs. Clinton and her labor supporters are out of step with working-class voters. Mrs. Clinton ""is 100% owned by Wall Street special interests, meaning she won't do anything to help union workers,"" Mr. Lewandowski said.More than half of the collective membership in AFL-CIO unions identify as Democrat, while about one-third identify as Republican and the rest as independent. The latter group is the one organized labor is most concerned about.""Trump appeals to union membership like the Teamsters and should be able to put together a modern-day Reagan Democrat coalition,"" said Scott Reed, a Republican campaign strategist.Union leaders say they are concerned that Mrs. Clinton's lead in national polls over Mr. Trump has been narrowing, but they note that she hasn't had a chance to consolidate Democrats. While she has won the vast majority of union endorsements, Mr. Sanders has ardent support from some of the more left-leaning unions, giving Mr. Trump an opening.""Trump has somewhat outflanked Hillary by making a case that he is the one who is for the true Democratic base,"" said Larry Hanley, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which has endorsed Mr. Sanders.Other labor officials play down the ultimate threat of Mr. Trump.""The union vote will be as strong as it's ever been,"" said Steve Rosenthal, a political strategist for unions. ""Fear is a mighty powerful motivator.""So far, the AFL-CIO and its president, Richard Trumka, have been the main forces taking jabs at Mr. Trump. The federation was running anti-Trump digital ads, sending anti-Trump texts to members and speaking out against Mr. Trump months ago.The AFL-CIO's community affiliate group, Working America, an organization for non-union people, has conducted what it calls ""front porch focus groups"" about Mr. Trump with some of its members and others. For five weeks through mid-January, canvassers visited nearly 1,700 likely voters with household incomes of $75,000 or less in white, working-class areas near Cleveland and Pittsburgh.While many Republicans who had decided on a candidate told canvassers they were behind Mr. Trump, one in four Democrats who had decided showed a preference for him, too.The canvassers were encouraged, however, that personality was far more important than issues among Trump supporters, with nearly halfsaying they liked him because he ""speaks his mind,"" the group said in a report.""What we found is if we had longer conversations with them that layered on different approaches, we could move people"" away from him, said Karen Nussbaum, Working America's executive director.Credit: By Melanie Trottman and Brody Mullins",8/16/16
Election 2016: Clinton Hits Trump Over His Defunct School,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793063304?accountid=12768,"NEWARK, N.J. -- Hillary Clinton seized on Donald Trump's legal troubles over a defunct real estate school on Wednesday, calling him a ""fraud"" who is ""trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U.""""Trump and his employees took advantage of vulnerable Americans, encouraging them to max out their credit cards, empty their retirement savings, destroy their financial futures -- all while making promises they knew were false from the beginning,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said at a rally ahead of New Jersey's primary on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton's comments -- some her sharpest rebukes to date of the presumptive Republican nominee -- came a day after documents were made public by Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California that disclosed some of the aggressive sales tactics the school used to entice prospective students.The documents relate to a California lawsuit brought by ex-students that accuses Mr. Trump and his former Trump University of tricking people into spending thousands of dollars on seminars with false promises of access to Mr. Trump and his real estate secrets.Mr. Trump also faces a separate case in New York, where state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's civil lawsuit alleges Trump University lacked proper licensing and defrauded thousands of students.Mr. Trump has denied the allegations, saying Trump University students got their money's worth. ""She's got it wrong,"" he said in a statement Wednesday, in response to Mrs. Clinton's comments. ""I will win my case in court. Thousands of people signed student evaluations saying the courses were excellent.""Mrs. Clinton, referring to the New York case, told the crowd: ""I want you to hear this: His own employees testified that Trump U -- you can't make this up -- that Trump U was a fraudulent scheme where Donald Trump enriched himself at the expense of hardworking people.""Mrs. Clinton, who made no mention of her Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, attacked Mr. Trump on other fronts Wednesday, including foreign policy and what she described as his sensitivity to media coverage.Referring to a news conference the New York businessman held Tuesday in which he excoriated reporters for examining his record of charitable donations, among other matters, Mrs. Clinton said: ""If you're in public life you're not always going to like what the press says about you. I have some experience with that. But part of the genius of our democracy, our system, is we have a free press.""Meanwhile, President Barack Obama stepped into the 2016 campaign Wednesday, offering voters an optimistic vision of the country's economic future and delivering a harsh critique of Mr. Trump, though he didn't mention him by name.Mr. Obama, speaking in Elkhart, Ind., said the GOP agenda is ""antigovernment, anti-immigrant, antitrade"" and serves as cover for policies that benefit the wealthy over the middle class while preying on Americans' lingering economic anxiety to win votes.---Carol E.

Clinton Launches Broadside At Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793509429?accountid=12768,"SAN DIEGO -- Hillary Clinton delivered an opening salvo in her expected November showdown with Donald Trump, a withering portrait of his foreign-policy positions as uninformed, unsophisticated and ""dangerous.""In an address Thursday before a crowd of supporters here, the Democratic presidential front-runner used humor, contempt and the presumptive Republican nominee's own words to make her case that America would make a ""historic mistake"" by electing Mr. Trump president and making him the commander in chief.""Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different,"" she said. ""They are dangerously incoherent. They are not even really ideas -- just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.""Mr. Trump -- who has argued that America's standing in the world has declined under President Barack Obama and would continue to slide if Mrs. Clinton is elected -- slammed Mrs. Clinton's speech in an interview on Thursday. ""It wasn't a foreign-policy speech, it was a hate speech,"" he said. ""She can't talk about foreign policy because she's made so many mistakes.""Mr. Trump, speaking Thursday evening in San Jose, echoed those points later and called Mrs. Clinton's speech ""pathetic.""Mrs. Clinton's address likely marks the beginning of a general-election debate that will be bruising. Mr. Trump already has begun portraying Mrs. Clinton as untrustworthy, a tack designed to play on her biggest vulnerability with voters.Mr. Trump also has highlighted the attack on a U.S. compound in Libya that led to the death of a U.S. ambassador and others while Mrs. Clinton was head of the State Department. In a March debate, he accused her of failing to intervene to save those who were killed in Benghazi. ""Guess what, when the phone rang, she wasn't there,"" he said.The speech came as Mrs. Clinton is locked in a tough race with Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of California's primary on Tuesday. Mr. Trump was scheduled to speak Thursday night at a campaign rally in San Jose, Calif.Mrs. Clinton made clear on Thursday her principal line of attack will be on Mr. Trump's temperament and unpredictability. ""He is not just unprepared -- he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,"" she said. Noting that the president has the power to launch nuclear weapons, she added: ""Do we want him making those calls -- someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?""In his interview, Mr. Trump dismissed Mrs. Clinton's questions about his temperament. ""If people want to win, they need a temperament like mine,"" he said. ""If people want to stagnate and go down, they need a temperament like Crooked Hillary.""Polls show that foreign policy is one of Mrs. Clinton's biggest advantages over Mr. Trump. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last month found 56% of voters said Mrs. Clinton would be better able to handle foreign policy, compared with 29% who picked Mr. Trump. The survey gave her a 10-point advantage on who would be the better commander in chief.The two candidates' approaches to foreign policy are markedly different. Mrs. Clinton is considered a hawk of the left, willing to take risks and engage in overseas skirmishes in order to project U.S. power and protect key alliances. She has spent more than two decades criticizing China's human-rights record and has referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""bully.""But she has faced criticism for not anticipating the chaotic results of the Arab spring that began in late 2010, which toppled several governments and continues to fuel Mideast wars. Republicans will also highlight Mrs. Clinton's support for the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump called a disaster on Thursday, and the scandal over her use of a private email server as secretary of state.Mr. Trump has characterized his foreign-policy vision as ""America First."" He has called for increasing the size of the U.S. military, but using it more sparingly. He would pull back from global conflicts that he believes don't serve any U.S. interest, and let foreign countries defend themselves.Mrs. Clinton questioned Mr. Trump's seemingly admiring comments about Mr. Putin, which Mr. Trump has said were taken out of context; his dismissal of the threat posed by North Korea leader Kim Jong Un; and his statement that the Chinese government acted with strength in ending protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. She added that she would ""leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.""Mrs. Clinton's speech was equal parts talking up her own record and trying to shred her GOP rival's. She mentioned twice that she was in the White House's Situation Room when Mr. Obama gave the order to kill Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and she contrasted this with Mr. Trump's business career, which has included the development of golf courses and casinos.""There's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf course deal, but it doesn't work like that in world affairs,"" she said.Just a few hours before Mrs. Clinton's broadside, Mr. Obama offered a more subtle critique of Mr. Trump's foreign-policy approach. ""We cannot turn inward, we cannot give in to isolationism,"" Mr. Obama told graduates at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. ""That's a false comfort.""Mr. Trump has, at times, backtracked on some of his more controversial statements. He had insisted that he would direct the U.S. military to torture terror suspects, but reversed course and said he would instead seek to change the Geneva Conventions to allow more aggressive interrogation techniques.Mr. Trump has said his readiness to challenge existing U.S. policy is what is needed to reassert global leadership and prevent other countries from ""laughing at us.""""When you rattle someone, that's good,"" Mr. Trump said recently in North Dakota. ""If they're rattled in a friendly way, that's a good thing.""He has also said that Mexico and China fleece the U.S. with dodgy trade practices, and that terror groups have exploited weak immigration laws to infiltrate European and U.S. cities. He has demanded that countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia pay the U.S. for military protection, or he will withdraw military support.Credit: By Damian Paletta and Rebecca Ballhaus",8/17/16
"Election 2016: Ryan Backs Trump, Ending Uncertainty --- The House speaker had hesitated to endorse the GOP's presumptive nominee",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793508875?accountid=12768,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) on Thursday endorsed Donald Trump for president, ending the highest-ranking elected Republican's public hesitation over the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee.Mr. Ryan's decision to back Mr. Trump flattened one of the last remaining hurdles the New York businessman faced in winning over the party's top leaders and donors. Though other prominent Republicans have refused to endorse Mr. Trump, the House speaker's acceptance of the contentious real-estate mogul effectively blunted any remaining momentum in the wing of the GOP that had once sought to stop Mr. Trump's ascent.In an opinion piece in his hometown newspaper, Mr. Ryan said he would vote for Mr. Trump after having spoken with him about policy issues. In early May, the speaker had said he was ""not ready"" to back the candidate, launching an awkward dance between the two.""It's no secret that he and I have our differences . . . And when I feel the need to, I'll continue to speak my mind,"" Mr. Ryan wrote in the Janesville Gazette. ""But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.""Mr. Trump in a tweet Thursday said it was ""great"" to have the speaker's support. ""We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!"" he added.GOP leaders and donors had already been coalescing behind Mr. Trump, who last week secured the delegates he needs to become the Republican presidential nominee and take on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November. The op-ed piece in the Wisconsin paper was published just as Mrs. Clinton delivered a major foreign-policy address in which she called Mr. Trump's positions ""dangerously incoherent.""Democrats welcomed the Ryan endorsement, saying Republicans now couldn't avoid being linked to Mr. Trump, which they hope would weigh down GOP lawmakers in swing states.""Speaker Ryan's abject surrender makes it official: the GOP is Trump's party now,"" said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid.Mr. Ryan has been under pressure from many Trump allies on Capitol Hill to help the GOP unify well ahead of its July convention in Cleveland, where Mr. Ryan is slated to serve as the chairman. Mr. Trump and a coterie of advisers visited Capitol Hill last month to meet with Mr. Ryan and other congressional GOP leaders, and the two leaders spoke on the phone last week.""I was confident that he would find Donald Trump to be a listener; someone who shares our basic policy issues,"" said Rep. Chris Collins of New York, the first House Republican to endorse Mr. Trump.Mr. Ryan was becoming one of the last remaining holdouts in his party, as even some Trump skeptics had acknowledged that he had won the national votes needed to make him the GOP nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) backed Mr. Trump as soon as his final rivals dropped out after the Indiana primary in early May.Rep. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) said both Messrs. Ryan and Trump told him they were encouraged by the phone conversation they had last Wednesday. Mr. Ryan took away from the talk ""that House Republicans were helping shape that agenda not only for ourselves, but also for Mr. Trump's campaign,"" said Mr. Cramer.Mr. Ryan said he had been encouraged when Mr. Trump last month released a list of 11 possible candidates to fill the Supreme Court vacancy.Some Republicans are concerned that many of Mr. Trump's positions -- including proposals to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border and deport all illegal immigrants -- would alienate groups of voters. Mr. Ryan has said he couldn't condone some of Mr. Trump's comments, and the two have split over trade, immigration policy and the size of federal safety-net programs. But House Republicans said Mr. Ryan thought their agenda has a better shot of getting enacted with Mr. Trump as president.""They'll never see eye to eye on free trade; they probably won't see eye to eye on the border either,"" said Rep. Duncan Hunter (R., Calif.), an early congressional endorser of Mr. Trump. ""But Paul Ryan's not a national elected figure -- Donald Trump is. I don't see why Donald Trump would move sideways or backwards or forwards to accommodate anyone's agenda.""Credit: By Kristina Peterson and Siobhan Hughes",8/17/16
Election 2016: Trump Keeps Heat on Judge --- Charge of a 'conflict' in case over university draws criticism from some legal observers,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793508697?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his attacks on the federal judge presiding over civil fraud lawsuits against Trump University, amid criticism from legal observers who say the presumptive GOP presidential nominee's comments are an unusual affront on an independent judiciary.In an interview, Mr. Trump said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had ""an absolute conflict"" in presiding over the litigation given that he was ""of Mexican heritage"" and a member of a Latino lawyers' association. Mr. Trump said the background of the judge, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants, was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern U.S. border. ""I'm building a wall. It's an inherent conflict of interest,"" Mr. Trump said.The New York businessman also alleged the judge was a former colleague and friend of one of the Trump University plaintiffs' lawyers. The judge and the lawyer once worked together as federal prosecutors, but the lawyer, Jason Forge, said he had never seen the judge socially.""Neither Judge Curiel's ethnicity nor the fact that we crossed paths as prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office well over a decade ago is to blame"" for Mr. Trump's actions, said Mr. Forge, who is with the law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.An assistant in Judge Curiel's chambers said he wasn't commenting on the matter. An aide to the judge has previously said the judicial code of conduct prevents him from responding to Mr. Trump. Judge Curiel is an Obama nominee who has served on the district court in San Diego since the Senate confirmed him in 2012.For judges, being criticized for rulings comes with the territory, but court watchers say it is far different when the critic could win the nation's highest office, is involved in a pending case and references the judge's ethnicity.University of Pennsylvania law professor Stephen Burbank said it was ""absolute nonsense"" that the judge shouldn't be able to preside over the case because of his ethnicity.Ronald Rotunda, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in Orange, Calif., noted that whatever Mr. Trump's grievances, his lawyers haven't filed for the case to be reassigned. If Mr. Trump has a problem with the judge, ""that's the legitimate way"" to register a complaint, he said.Mr. Trump in the interview said that he may do so. Other judges, he said, would have thrown out the plaintiffs' case against the school, he said.The GOP candidate's comments follow a San Diego speech last week in which he called the judge ""a hater of Donald Trump"" and ""a total disgrace,"" while referencing the judge's ethnicity.Mr. Trump also criticized the judge Thursday on Twitter, saying he would win the litigation and reopen the now-defunct Trump University when the cases were done.While Mr. Trump's comments prompted criticism, he said he believed the bigger threat is to be treated unfairly by the courts. ""It's called freedom of speech,"" he said.Legal experts agreed that defendants have the First Amendment freedom to express opinions about a judge hearing their case -- as long as they aren't disruptive in the courtroom.Judge Curiel is presiding over a pair of cases in which the plaintiffs alleged Trump University duped them into paying tens of thousands of dollars on the belief they would be trained to learn Mr. Trump's real-estate strategies. Mr. Trump denies the allegations, saying the students got their money's worth, with many offering positive evaluations of the program.The judge has issued pre-trial rulings against Mr. Trump and has unsealed documents offering a detailed look at the business's operations and scathing assessments from some former workers.During the 1996 presidential campaign, both President Bill Clinton and Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, criticized a Clinton-appointed New York federal judge, Harold Baer, who excluded prosecutors' evidence in a high-profile narcotics case. In response, four judges on the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a statement in defense of Judge Baer, saying the officials' remarks had gone ""too far"" and could intimidate other judges.Judge Baer later reversed his ruling, though he said it wasn't because of political pressure. He eventually took himself off the case.---Jacob Gershman contributed to this article.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Use the First Amendment to Condemn Trump"" -- WSJ June 20, 2016)Credit: By Brent Kendall",8/17/16
Politics & Ideas: Sex and the Citizens: Trump Edition,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792700038?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump doesn't speak the truth so much as reveal it. His campaign has ruthlessly exposed the illusions of well-educated middle-class professionals -- people like me.We believed that changes in law and public norms had gradually brought about changes in private attitudes across partisan and ideological lines. We thought that longstanding racial and ethnic prejudices had been marginalized. We hoped that the most religious population in any Western democracy would deal compassionately with the suffering of refugees from war-torn nations, whatever their religion. We assumed that some beliefs had moved so far beyond the pale that those who continued to hold them would not dare to say so publicly.Mr. Trump has proved us wrong. His critique of political correctness has destroyed many taboos and has given his followers license to say what they really think. Beliefs we mocked now command a majority in one of the world's oldest political parties, and sometimes in the electorate as a whole.Nowhere is that truer than in gender relations. Mr. Trump's attitudes toward women are a throwback to the Rat Pack. His past on-air conversations with shock-jock Howard Stern make Don Draper of ""Mad Men"" sound like a feminist. His response to the familiar critique that these attitudes ""objectify"" women is, in effect: That's what men do. The difference is that I don't hide it. You've tried to make us feel guilty, and we're not going to take it anymore. In my America, men will be free once again to be men, and the country will be better off.Surprising numbers of Americans seem to agree with him.In April, survey researchers at the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) asked a blunt question: Do you agree or disagree with the statement that ""Society as a whole has become too soft and feminine."" Fifty percent of men agreed, as did 34% of women. Whites and Hispanics gave the statement identical 42% support, with African-Americans a few points lower. Whites had the largest gap between men and women (20 points), with the African-American gap close behind at 17 points. The Hispanic gap stood at only six points -- Hispanic women were significantly more likely to agree with the sentiment than were their white and African-American counterparts.Forty-five percent of respondents with a high-school education or less agreed with the ""too soft and feminine"" proposition; so did 48% of those with some college education, compared with only 31% for those with a bachelor's degree or more.Age made less difference than might have been expected. In fact, Americans in the 30-49 age range were somewhat more likely to agree than were those 50 and older, with only the youngest adults registering a significantly different view.By contrast, partisanship and ideology made a big difference. Sixty percent of Republicans felt that American society has become ""too soft and feminine,"" compared with 43% of independents and only 29% of Democrats. Support among conservatives, moderates and liberals stood at 58%, 44% and 24%, respectively.Gender and partisanship interact. Seventy-two percent of Republican men endorsed the statement, compared with 46% of Republican women. Although Democratic men were less than half as likely as their Republican counterparts to agree, they were 10 points more likely to do so than were Democratic women.As one might expect, Mr. Trump has mobilized the most passionate opponents of America's current gender regime: 68% of his supporters believe that society has become ""too soft and feminine"" -- 74% of men backing him, and 59% of the women. (Females in the Trump camp are 25 points more likely to express this sentiment than are women as a whole.)So Mr. Trump's supporters want a tougher, more masculine America. But what does this mean, exactly? The PRRI survey, conducted in partnership with the Atlantic magazine, offers some clues. Although only 39% of Americans believe that society is better off when men and women hew to traditional gender roles, the figure rises to 50% among Mr. Trump's backers.Women are often seen as more compliant with established rules than are men, and more inclined to pursue progress through compromise within these rules. But large majorities of Americans think the country is on the wrong track, and in the PRRI poll nearly half -- 45% -- have concluded that to set things right, we need a leader who is willing to break the rules on their behalf.Among Mr. Trump's supporters, 65% endorse this view. My interpretation: They think it will take a ""real man,"" indifferent to respectable opinion and procedural niceties, to blow up the entire corrupt system and get the country back on track.The general-election contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will bring gender to the center of American politics, with consequences that are no more predictable than any other dimension of this astounding year.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Donald Trump Exploits Progressive Morality"" -- WSJ June 10, 2016)Credit: By William A.

Trump's Politics of Grievance,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792699946?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump laid out his energy policy last week, and it drew a sharp and welcome contrast with Hillary Clinton on developing U.S. oil and natural gas. Too bad few Americans will have noticed because the presumptive GOP presidential nominee spent the days before and since denouncing all and sundry who haven't embraced his candidacy. This politics of personal grievance may be the businessman's biggest obstacle to the White House.For a candidate who claims we should all be less easily offended, Mr. Trump may have the thinnest skin in politics. He seems to think all politics is personal and that his looming nomination means that every Republican should line up, Chris Christie-like, in political deference. His demand for obeisance is alienating more people than it attracts.Start with his now famous attack in New Mexico on that state's Republican Governor Susana Martinez. ""She's got to do a better job. She's not doing the job,"" he declared at a rally in the state last week. His calculation is that Republican Governors need to rally behind his candidacy, so he wanted to make a public example of a holdout.""She was not nice. And I was fine -- just a little bit of a jab,"" Mr. Trump said at his Tuesday veterans event this week. ""But she wasn't nice, and you think I'm going to change? I'm not changing, including with her.""This politics of pique is more likely to achieve the opposite. Mr. Trump's challenge, if he wants to win in November, includes persuading millions of Republicans who believe he's too crude and thuggish to build a political majority. The way to convince them is not to trash a two-term Republican Governor in a swing state with a 67% approval rating who, by the way, is an Hispanic American.Mr. Trump followed up later in the week with a rhetorical assault on Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over one of the lawsuits alleging fraud by Trump University. The candidate said the judge is ""a hater,"" is ""negative, negative, negative,"" was ""appointed by Barack Obama"" and ""happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that's fine.""Judge Curiel is a native Hoosier, and last we heard even Mr. Trump doesn't want to build a wall around Indiana. Mr. Trump managed to combine an ethnic slight with an un-presidential attack on an independent judiciary. This is a private civil suit and Mr. Trump isn't yet able to nominate judges, but a presumptive nominee ought to adhere to a higher standard -- if only in his own political self-interest.Millions of Americans who might support Mr. Trump in order to shake up Washington are also asking if he has the temperament and character to be a good President. This means showing respect for the institutions of self-government, such as the judiciary. It also means not continuing a politics of racial polarization that equates ethnicity with judicial unfairness.For all of his marketing genius, Mr. Trump is also remarkably sensitive to media criticism. He attacks reporters at seemingly every chance, turning his press conference Tuesday into a media struggle session. He called the press corps ""dishonest"" and libelous, singled out ABC's Tom Llamas as ""a sleaze"" and mocked another reporter as ""a real beauty.""Many Americans who loathe the press will cheer him on, but down this road lies tears. An adversarial relationship with the press is inevitable for a Republican candidate, and for all Presidents, even Democrats. Mr. Trump ought to learn from Ronald Reagan and roll with it -- rather than heed the Nixon model of letting it consume him until it induces an overreaction that takes him down.Mr. Trump and his partisans are highlighting the polls that show he's caught up to Hillary Clinton in November matchups. But he's running against one of the worst Democratic candidates in the last 50 years in a year when voters are eager for change. A John Kasich or Marco Rubio would be 10 points ahead.Mr. Trump still faces a difficult path to victory given his dreadful approval ratings among women and especially minorities. Mrs. Clinton will probably be able to consolidate Democratic support even if she doesn't inspire it -- thanks, in part, to the fear of Mr. Trump. She is far ahead in fund-raising, campaign organization and voter targeting. Mr. Trump needs to convince millions of skeptical voters that he's more than an impulsive bully who poses too big a risk in the Oval Office.",8/17/16
Trump Makes Sense on Energy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1792699860?accountid=12768,"Political markets are weird: They cry out for something and yet politicians, with their enslavement to conventional wisdom and careerist caution, are unwilling to supply it.Then along comes Donald Trump.Mr. Trump, in his set-piece energy speech on Thursday, did something that might outlast his presidential hopes. In his anti-intellectual way, he made an intellectual contribution. For decades, poorly justified scientific fears of future warming have hovered as an incubus over U.S. energy development. These fears, you'll notice, have not actually blocked much of anything: Fracking happened. The U.S. continues to export coal to China. But these fears fill America's leadership class with guilt and cognitive dissonance.Give Mr. Trump credit for trying to break the spell.In a speech the media has done its best to ignore or debunk, he said, ""From an environmental standpoint, my priorities are very simple: clean air and clean water."" With these words, he relegated back to the land of abstraction the abstraction known as climate change.His was a model political speech, one that Hillary Clinton might learn from. It set an agenda, with a minimum of windy rationalization, that voters can assess. Mr. Trump, as all politicians do, offered a prayer to the false deity of energy independence but he also offered a perfectly serviceable vision of Americans freely competing in global energy markets based on our own natural and (note) renewable resources and technology.Mr. Trump hit the climate moment squarely.By now, it should be obvious that a succession of ""fraudulent"" (to borrow a word used by out-of-school climate activist James Hansen) agreements like Kyoto, Copenhagen and Paris are not paving the way for a non-fraudulent agreement to impose costly climate actions the public would never support.The climate policy that actually gets enacted by now has a track record: It consists of ludicrous gestures and policies of cost-without-benefit like Tesla subsidies, whose driving force is the desire of influential pre-Trumpian elites for handouts.As for the $100 billion spent on climate research, it has yielded one certainty: A human impact is hard to disentangle from a welter of natural variables.What's more, science can't deny its nature forever. New information, based on actually measuring and understanding things like temperatures, emissions and cloud formation, is increasingly rewriting our hazy understanding of atmospheric processes. This data suggests our computer models have overstated the warming risk.Also ripe to be revisited are the ""business as usual"" scenarios presumed by the climate alarmists, in which patterns of energy production and consumption don't change in the absence of heroic government central planning efforts.The emergence of fracking, which has played the major role in upending the U.S. coal industry, was not the product of climate policy.The rise of the lithium-ion battery and explosion of battery-powered devices in our lives, of which even Tesla is but a flamboyant and overrated derivative, was not the product of climate policy.Climate movement types, meanwhile, have increasingly turned to vilifying nonbelievers as a substitute for dealing sensibly with a possible human impact on climate. A minority movement is on its way to becoming a cult, increasingly anti-science. Know them by their talk of ""saving"" the planet: Even under the worst scenarios, global warming does not endanger the planet. It poses an inconvenience to human communities that have become accustomed to stacking their wealth at the water's edge.Perhaps it took Donald Trump fully to exploit the fish-in-a-barrel vulnerability of Democrats on climate. Democrats love citing a pending climate catastrophe but want to live in the land of the real politically, never taking ownership of policies actually commensurate with the alleged crisis. Al Gore, when he was running for president in 2000, wanted Bill Clinton to open the strategic reserve to keep gas prices low.In his speech, Mr. Trump tweaked Hillary Clinton for promoting U.S fracking technology to China as secretary of state, then proposing to regulate fracking out of existence at home. He tweaked President Obama for seeking to block Canada's energy exports by killing the Keystone pipeline even while enabling Iran to open its spigots.Mr. Obama, proving again that he makes a better representative of the countries he visits than the one he comes from, said from Japan on Thursday that foreign leaders are ""rattled"" by the rise of Donald Trump.Good grief. What endorsement could carry less weight with the American people? These are the same foreign leaders who've been marching America's major allies into permanent decline, not least with massive renewable-energy subsidies that have produced no benefit for their societies. If anything survives as a monument to the great Trump boom of 2016, let's hope it's a turn toward realism on energy and climate.Credit: By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.",8/17/16
Trump Tower Climber Arraigned in New York; Stephen Rogata charged with trespassing and reckless endangerment after attempting to scale the Midtown Manhattan building,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811946176?accountid=12768,"Corrections & Amplifications:Trump Tower climber Stephen Rogata was apprehended by the New York Police Department's Emergency Service Unit.

(Aug. 17)The Virginia man facing trespassing and reckless-endangerment charges after attempting to scale Trump Tower appeared on Wednesday before a judge, who ordered him held on $10,000 cash or $5,000 bond.Stephen Rogata, 19 years old, was arraigned from Bellevue Hospital Center via satellite, appearing before Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Kevin McGrath in a blue jumpsuit with his hands cuffed behind his back. He didn't enter a plea.Mr. Rogata, of Great Falls, Va., was charged with reckless endangerment in the second degree, one count of base jumping, criminal trespass and trespass. He was pulled off the exterior of Trump Tower last Wednesday in an incident that captivated onlookers for hours.Mr. Rogata used suction cups and other equipment to climb to the 21st floor before the New York Police Department's Emergency Service Unit apprehended him.""I did it for the publicity, as I thought it was the best way to meet Donald Trump,"" he allegedly told authorities after he was caught, according to court officials.Mr. Rogata later told investigators that he purchased the climbing equipment from Amazon two weeks before the incident and waited until his parents went out of Great Falls to perform the stunt, officials said.During his climb, a laptop fell from his possession and crashed onto an atrium five floors below, according to court records. As authorities attempted to catch him by knocking out windows, using scaffolding to block his path and extending a safety line, Mr. Rogata temporarily evaded them by moving sideways and refusing efforts to retrieve him.""I'm not taking the rope. I'm going to see Trump,"" he allegedly told authorities. ""I know you're looking out for me, but I'm going to see Trump. Please don't grab me.""After police took him into custody, Mr. Rogata was transported for examination to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he remains.""At best he was doing something particularly stupid with the hopes of meeting someone he will never get to meet in this lifetime,"" said his attorney, Tara Collins.Mr. Rogata spoke only once during his arraignment, answering ""yes, I can"" when Judge McGrath asked whether he could hear him via the video connection.Mr. Rogata is due back in court on Oct. 13.We Want to Hear From YouHave something to say about an article in Greater New York?

Trump Misses the Point on Tech Visas; Employers hire high-skill immigrants for the same reason they hire low-skill ones: out of necessity.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811629379?accountid=12768,"It was an example of what Rush Limbaugh calls ""drive-by media"" coverage--the sensational and superficial reporting of a story while skimping on context.In June of last year, the New York Times wrote on its front page that the Disney World resort in Orlando, Fla., had furloughed about 250 tech workers. The employees were offered severance packages and bonuses if they remained for a few months to train their replacements. One hundred and sixty of the displaced workers retired or were rehired in new jobs by Disney. About 90 took the severance.No one likes to read about someone losing his job, but Disney employs more than 70,000 people in Orlando alone. The fact that 90 of them ultimately were pushed out is free-market economic churn and wouldn't normally be news. The reason the Times highlighted the story is because some of the replacement hires were high-skill immigrants. The layoffs at Disney and other companies, such as Southern California Edison, said the Times, ""are raising new questions about how businesses and outsourcing companies are using the temporary visas, known as H-1B, to place immigrants in technology jobs in the United States.""The suggestion here is that U.S. companies are gaming the visa system by using foreign-based outsourcing firms to replace more-expensive Americans with less-expensive immigrants. It's what those who see labor markets in zero-sum terms--an immigrant worker's gain is a U.S. worker's loss--would have us believe. Donald Trump invited the laid-off Disney workers to a rally in Alabama in February, showing once again that the Republican presidential nominee's opposition to immigration isn't limited to the illegal variety.But a report released last week by the National Foundation for American Policy challenges some of the basic assumptions in the outsourcing debate. For starters, both government and academic research shows that H-1B visa-holders, on balance, are not paid less than comparable U.S. workers. In fact, the data show the opposite. ""After comparing the median reported salaries of U.S. workers and H-1B professionals in the same fields and age groups, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found H-1B professionals generally earn the same or more than their U.S. counterparts,"" says the new report.Nor is it clear that eliminating these visas would stop or even reduce the likelihood that a company would outsource. Typically, companies outsource so that they can focus more on their core activities, and handling accounting or IT functions in-house no longer makes sense. ""Companies are not replacing long-time employees with new workers doing the exact same jobs,"" according the study, ""but rather replacing the employees with new systems in an attempt to perform the function in a more efficient way.""The study's author, Stuart Anderson, told me that scapegoating immigrants for these layoffs assumes that immigration law is driving the decision to outsource. In reality, hiring a contractor is often done through a competitive bidding process, and the company doesn't know beforehand whether or to what extent the winning bidder will use H-1B visa holders.But the bigger oversight is the assumption that these U.S. workers would have retained their jobs if Disney and other companies that outsource had chosen firms that employ only U.S. workers. Mr. Anderson found no evidence to support that. Once the contracting decision was made, some employees unfortunately were going to lose their jobs, either to a visa-holder or another U.S. worker.U.S. employers turn to high-skill immigrants for the same reason they turn to low-skill immigrants--out of necessity. Foreign nationals, who tend to be either more skilled or less skilled than the typical U.S. worker, fill niches in our labor markets and make them more efficient and productive. Between 2006 and 2012, immigrants started one-third of U.S. venture-backed companies that became publicly traded. In recent years, more than half of the billion-dollar startups based in the U.S., including Uber and SpaceX, had at least one immigrant founder.The technology revolution that began in the 1990s has dramatically increased the demand for workers in the fields of math and science. But more than 70% of full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and computer science at American universities are international students. Over the past three decades, college-degree holders outside of the U.S. have more than doubled, while the U.S. share of those with college degrees has declined by 30%. Employers want access to this international pool of talent because that's where the people with desirable skill sets are concentrated.Hillary Clinton (on trade) and Donald Trump (on trade and immigration) are too busy scaring voters to be bothered with a sober discussion on the causes and effects of outsourcing. But the winner in November will have to produce faster economic growth if he or she wants a second term. And that won't happen if U.S. companies can't hire and retain the workers they need to stay competitive in a global economy.Mr. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Journal contributor, is the author of ""Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed"" (Encounter Books, 2014).Credit: By Jason L.

Therefore, when we run massive and chronic trade deficits, it weakens our economy. This relationship is often reported on your news pages, along with the negative stock-market reactions typically associated with such reports of widening trade deficits.Mr. Trump's free-trading policy is intended to boost our economy by increasing exports and overall trade while reducing our trade deficit through tougher and smarter trade negotiations. That is in sharp contrast to his opponent Hillary Clinton who has supported three of the worst trade deficit-inducing deals in the last 23 years: 1993's Nafta, China's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization and a 2012 South Korean deal which has more than doubled our trade deficit with that country and hammered our auto industry.Wilbur RossNew York(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Wilbur Ross Is Wrong About the Trade Deficit"" -- WSJ Aug. 19, 2016)",8/18/16

"The College Republicans Divide Over Trump; For the GOP, campus is occupied territory. But this year it's hard to see where the battle lines are drawn.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812800599?accountid=12768,"This past spring, ""Feel the Bern"" laptop stickers and T-shirts proliferated at colleges across the nation as Bernie Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Students heading back to campus for the new school year, however, are not likely to see many ""Make America Great Again"" caps--even among self-avowed Republicans.At left-of-center universities College Republicans have always been working in occupied territory. But this year they have splintered over Donald Trump. Their responses, which range from enthusiastic to antipathetic, mirror divisions in the national GOP.The Harvard Republican Club will not be supporting this year's nominee. ""Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic,"" the club announced in an Aug. 4 statement. President Declan Garvey says that in a recent survey of club members only 10% backed the party's nominee.At Hillsdale College, Republicans do not traditionally endorse candidates. This year is no different, says president Brant Cohen. ""We desire our members to think and choose for themselves using the foundation of a conservative worldview.""The Princeton Republicans are new to the Hillsdale approach. On Aug. 8 the club declined to take a position on Mr. Trump's candidacy. In a sign of the times, its statement says ""we encourage people to vote for candidates who have demonstrated a commitment to Republican policies.""Like their Princeton counterparts, Ohio University Republicans plan to focus on down-ballot races this year. The club's president, David Parkhill, calls himself ""very pro-Trump,"" but adds, ""there are members that aren't on the 'Trump Train' yet, so it makes things a little tricky."" The cover photo on the club's Facebook page promotes the re-election of incumbent Sen. Rob Portman.The College Republican National Committee takes a forgiving tone. Chairman Alexandra Smith says ""there is more than one way to be a College Republican."" She further notes the ""nearly universal"" opposition to Hillary Clinton among College Republican chapters, as well as their strong support for down-ballot Republicans.Still, not every campus chapter is reticent about the GOP nominee. The 600-member Citadel Republican Society ""enthusiastically supports Donald Trump,"" according to president Zac Rutherford. Ditto for Liberty University, where chairman Jonah Athey says his College Republicans are ""proud to stand behind Donald Trump."" The University of Alabama College Republicans president Drew Mansell agreed, noting, ""the choice in this election could not be more clear.""Perhaps the most comprehensive endorsement of Mr. Trump comes from the Notre Dame College Republicans, which took the form of a 900-word statement assessing the New Yorker's policies. ""We can and must support our party's nominee,"" the Fighting Irish Republicans concluded. ""While his personality may be brash, it is important to remember that we are not electing a neighbor or a friend.""At Yale, my own university, the College Republicans affirmed their support for Mr. Trump earlier this month. ""Our party, of which we are an official branch and to which we remain loyal,"" read the statement, ""has nominated Donald Trump for president.""Well, not everyone was loyal. In response to this endorsement, several club leaders immediately resigned to establish the ""Yale New Republicans""--who pledge to ""put national interests above partisan ones.""So what does it matter whether or not College Republicans endorse Mr. Trump? Millennial.gop--a project of the College Republican National Committee--notes the high price of ignoring young voters.""If young voters had voted like other age groups,"" it points out, ""Mitt Romney would have won the popular vote and the electoral college, with significant gains for Republicans down ballot."" As the schism among College Republican chapters underscores, Mr. Trump is having a hard time even among young people who are already Republican. What does that say about his prospects for the larger youth vote come November?Mr. Young, a Robert L.

"Election 2016: Trump Defends Stance as Ryan Is Critical --- As GOP anxiety rises, candidate says words on Mexican heritage were 'misconstrued'",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794819197?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump defended his attacks on the federal judge handling a lawsuit Tuesday in an effort to fend off an avalanche of criticism from congressional Republicans worried the GOP presumptive nominee's remarks could wreak havoc on the party's political prospects across the country in 2016.In a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump took back none of his criticisms of U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing cases against the Trump University real-estate program, or the questions the candidate has raised about the judge's ability to be impartial because he is of Mexican heritage.""It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent.""Mr. Trump said in the statement that he would no longer discuss the topic.Addressing supporters on Tuesday night as the polls were closing on the last day of the GOP primary, he avoided any mention of the controversy. He turned instead to the subject that was most likely to unify his GOP colleagues: an attack on Hillary Clinton.But then, after his speech, Mr. Trump went on Fox News's ""Hannity,"" where he again addressed the case against Trump University -- though he refrained from discussing the judge's heritage.Meanwhile on Tuesday, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for re-election this year, became the first GOP lawmaker to rescind his endorsement of Mr. Trump.Earlier in the day, the furor over Mr. Trump's comments overshadowed the rollout of the first component of House Speaker Paul Ryan's GOP agenda. Instead of discussing his plan to combat poverty, the Wisconsin Republican worked to publicly square his continued support for Mr. Trump, whom he endorsed last week, with Mr. Trump's comments on the judge, which Mr. Ryan disavowed as racist.""Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,"" said Mr. Ryan. ""I'm not even going to pretend to try to defend them."" However, Mr. Ryan said Mr. Trump would still be preferable to likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as president.Across the Capitol, senior Republicans worried publicly Mr. Trump's comments could hurt their ability to retake the White House and retain control of the Senate majority.""My advice to the nominee would be to start talking about the issues that the American people care about and to start doing it now,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told reporters. ""It's time to quit attacking various people that you've competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message.""GOP anxiety extended far beyond the Capitol. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Trump for president this year, said in a Twitter message, ""Donald Trump should retract his comments, not defend them. There is no place for racism in the GOP, or this country.""In his statement, Mr. Trump said that ""I do not feel that one's heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.""While Republicans nearly universally condemned Mr. Trump's attacks on the judge, many said they would still prefer him to be the one nominating Supreme Court judges or working with a GOP-controlled Congress to roll back regulations.Senate Republicans up for re-election this year in swing states need to win over independent voters, who may disagree with Mr. Trump, without angering the GOP voters who backed Mr. Trump in the primary contests.Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's comments were making it harder for vulnerable Senate Republicans to win re-election.""If he's your standard-bearer, making the kind of statements that he's making, that's damaging,"" said Mr. Flake, noting that he struggled in his 2012 Senate race with controversial rape comments from GOP Senate candidates Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.Mr. Kirk cited concerns over several recent Trump comments. ""While I oppose the Democratic nominee, Donald Trump's latest statements, in context with past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that I cannot and will not support my party's nominee for president regardless of the political impact on my candidacy or the Republican Party,"" Mr. Kirk said in a statement.Democrats criticized Republicans who condemned Mr. Trump's comments without rescinding their endorsement, saying that put politics ahead of principle.""We've seen our Senate Republicans squirming and twisting, trying to find their way out of the Trump straitjacket that's handcuffing their party this year,"" Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a member of Senate Democratic leadership, told reporters.Credit: By Kristina Peterson, Janet Hook and Siobhan Hughes",8/22/16
Trump U Redefines the 'Brand',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794307512?accountid=12768,"If Donald Trump's tirade against Judge Gonzalo Curiel arises from his sense that Trump University has become a threat to his presidential hopes, he may be right.Poetic justice has taken a hand. The failure of Trump U, and its resulting lawsuits, would not be a national story in the first place, subject of withering investigations by major press organs, if Mr. Trump weren't running for president.Secondly, the lawsuits themselves portray a scam that precisely reflects the arc of Mr. Trump's career, from tyro real-estate developer to peddler of his personal ""brand."" Could there be a more apt example of the Peter Principle than if Mr. Trump's latest brand extension -- into presidential politics -- ends up destroying his brand?His private interests, his public interests -- Mr. Trump does not make distinctions. It's all about one thing, Mr. Trump's unhealthy love affair with an image of himself. That said, doesn't his latest eruption seem like something more: if not a cry for help, an unconscious rebellion against the situation he made for himself?His improper remarks about the judge follow his improper threats against Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post. There's a connection: A petition from the Post brought last week's release of embarrassing trial documents, featuring testimony by former Trump U employees who came to regard his real-estate school as a swindle, that brought Mr. Trump's furious charges that Judge Curiel was biased and a hater of Donald Trump.The Trump explosion comes just in time to humiliate Paul Ryan, after the House speaker's reluctant endorsement of Mr. Trump. It comes just in time to humiliate John McCain (again), who faintly praised Mr. Trump as a candidate he could live with because America's constitutional protections mean we won't become ""Romania.""Nowhere to be seen is Paul Manafort, the Republican wise man who was supposed to set the Trump campaign on a path to November electability. As a Washington Post headline put it: ""GOP can stop waiting for the 'new' Trump to emerge.""Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is still obsessing over the growth in his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram followings. In an interview with media provocateur Michael Wolff in the Hollywood Reporter, he can't get beyond wonder at the phenomenon that has swept him up. ""Middle of the pack,"" he recently admitted, is where he expected to rank in the GOP field.We come again to the Trump-as-democratic-accident problem. Mr. Trump has always been an interesting American specimen, enriching our national pageant, but he has left his natural sphere. He lacks the qualities to rise to the occasion in which he finds himself.Happily, there's still time for Republicans, at their convention, to replace Mr. Trump with someone else, though this will require continued help from Mr. Trump. But he's working on it. On Monday, he ordered his staff to double-down on vilifying Judge Curiel. He said on TV that a hypothetical Muslim judge might also be unfit to preside. And when and if the Trump U cases proceed to trial before a jury, whole voting blocs (women) will be on the edge of their seats to find out if they're disqualified because Mr. Trump previously insulted them.All this offers a second chance for those prominent Republicans who, from party loyalty, misborn hopes for Mr. Trump's transformation or a mistaken idea of their own populist bona fides, clambered aboard the Trump express.Q: So to be clear, if Donald Trump gets to 1,237 delegates, all the fighting over delegate selection and convention rules probably goes away.A: That is not guaranteed, but it would make it all the harder for opponents to summon the political will to alter the rules in a way that produces a nominee other than someone who won the popular vote and the bound-delegate tally heading into the convention.That comes from a late April Q&A between New York Magazine's Ed Kilgore and University of Georgia elections expert Josh Putnam. Roger Stone, the Igor who appears to think himself the Dr. Frankenstein of the Trump phenomenon, has begun blogging about a conspiracy of the Republican National Lawyers Association to ""steal"" the nomination in Cleveland. A few convention delegates already have called for a vote on Day One to free themselves from any obligation to support a particular candidate on the first ballot.Let's hope so, because Mr. Trump could yet be on his way to the presidency. Hillary Clinton last week gave a speech widely praised for its listing of Mr. Trump's improprieties. A campaign of ""Ha, ha, you're stuck with me because Trump is awful"" may not be the winner her strategists imagine.Though the AP curiously awarded the Democratic nomination to Mrs. Clinton on Monday based on her superdelegate commitments, superdelegates aren't bound. They can change their allegiances as many times as they want. Just conceivably, victory this year might end up going to whichever party is ruthless enough to dump its current nominee-apparent.Credit: By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.",8/22/16
High Trump Anxiety,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794307379?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump throttled back his racial attacks on a federal judge on Tuesday, and presumably he'll now follow his normal M.O. of displacing one self-created controversy by creating another. But the episode has renewed Republican doubts about his candidacy, and the presumptive presidential nominee is in more political peril than he thinks.Mr. Trump said in statement that it is ""unfortunate"" that his claims about Judge Gonzalo Curiel -- an American, Indiana-born -- have been ""misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage."" He said he merely meant that he wasn't getting a fair trial in the civil-fraud case over Trump University, and his statement included a lengthy defense of the now-defunct real-estate seminars.---Before this welcome turnabout, Mr. Trump tripled down on his comments, suggesting that maybe Muslim and female judges would be prejudiced against him too. As recently as Monday afternoon, Bloomberg reported, Mr. Trump told his cast of cable-TV surrogates to assail Judge Curiel's integrity as well. He repudiated a campaign memo, which he learned about on the call, telling supporters to downplay Trump U.""Take that order and throw it the hell out,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Are there any other stupid letters that were sent to you folks? That's one of the reasons I want to have this call, because you guys are getting sometimes stupid information from people that aren't so smart.""Mr. Trump's campaign was always going to be a daily adventure, but this particular detour reflects poorly on his political and strategic judgment -- deplorable as his comments were on the merits. He provoked the irruption with a diatribe against Judge Curiel during an ad-libbed rally in San Diego. Since Mr. Trump brought it up, the press served a round of stories about life on Trump campus, such as the ""playbooks"" that told sales personnel to encourage students to max out credit cards to pay the fees.The polls show the economy is Mr. Trump's chief advantage over Hillary Clinton, but he was too busy claiming Hispanics can't be fair judges to showcase Friday's dispiriting jobs report. He also allowed the State Department investigation of Mrs. Clinton's private email practices to tumble down the memory hole, and he made little effort to counterpunch her speech on his temperament and foreign policy -- aside from tweets about her appearance. Unanswered attacks usually succeed.Mr. Trump has been the presumptive GOP nominee for five weeks, and he made progress in two or perhaps three of them. His Capitol Hill get-to-know-you tour started to form relationships with elected GOP officials, and he secured endorsements like House Speaker Paul Ryan's. His energy speech was substantive, and his list of potential Supreme Court nominees showed someone had consulted with the legal right's smarter thinkers. Mr. Trump gained on Mrs. Clinton in the national polls.No one ever expected Mr. Trump to change his personality -- but they did figure he would adopt the methods necessary to win a modern election. Instead, Mr. Trump continues to deride fundraising, polling, data analytics, voter targeting and staffers like field organizers. He has built no communications team as far as we can tell beyond press secretary Hope Hicks and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.Mrs. Clinton has 21 press aides including a communications director, a lead press secretary, a day-to-day spokesman, a travelling press secretary, a rapid-response director, a rapid-response spokesperson and a variety of handlers dedicated to regional and specialized outlets. This is what it takes to drive a coherent national message.Mr. Trump may believe a similar apparatus is a waste of money, and that he can run his campaign out of his hip pocket like the Trump Organization: shoestring, centralized and ad hoc, with nearly every decision made at the top. He may think, too, that the political professionals are dummies and he'll keep winning like he did in the primaries.But the pros know that competing in a general election, and appealing to a voting-age population of some 240 million, is different than winning 40% of the Republican primary vote. It also doesn't inspire confidence that Mr. Trump's political and business operations are so fungible: Many Republicans will conclude that he chose the self-interest of his personal brand in a petty Trump U lawsuit over increasing his odds of winning the White House.Mr. Trump said in his statement that he does ""not intend to comment on this matter any further,"" and maybe someone staged an intervention, or he finally came to appreciate the panic he is generating among Republicans.If Mr. Trump doesn't start to act like a political leader, and his poll numbers collapse between now and the July convention, he may start to hear rumblings that delegates are looking for someone else to nominate. As traumatic as that would be, the Republican desire to avoid a landslide defeat that costs the House and Senate might be stronger.",8/22/16
Trump vs. Clinton on Gun Rights,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793166382?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is famous for his flights of political exaggeration, but every so often he lands on the truth. Witness his claim to the National Rifle Association on Friday that ""the Second Amendment is on the ballot in November"" and that Hillary Clinton ""wants to abolish the Second Amendment.""This has offended Mrs. Clinton's media bodyguards who claim she merely favors background checks and minor regulation. Mrs. Clinton took to Twitter to claim that Mr. Trump is ""wrong,"" and ""We can uphold Second Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence.""Let's go to the audiotape. If Mrs. Clinton ""gets to appoint her judges, she will as part of it abolish the Second Amendment,"" Mr. Trump told the NRA. He added that Mrs. Clinton had rebuked the Supreme Court for its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller establishing that the Second Amendment included an individual right to bear arms.At a private fundraiser last year Mrs. Clinton did criticize the Supreme Court for being ""wrong on the Second Amendment."" One of her policy advisers, Maya Harris, tried to muddy that position this weekend by telling Bloomberg Politics that Mrs. Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.""But that is a fudge. Heller explicitly allowed that the ""right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited."" Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion did not sort through every possible regulation, but it did say that the individual right covers guns that are ""in common use for lawful purposes."" And it overturned the District of Columbia's handgun ban. By implication Heller would also disallow the Clinton Administration's ban on semi-automatic rifles used for hunting. That ban has since expired, though Mrs. Clinton supports reinstating it.The question Mrs. Clinton is ducking is whether she agrees with Heller's ruling that individuals can bear arms. The political left has long held that such a right under the Second Amendment belongs only to a ""well regulated Militia.""This distinction matters because Mrs. Clinton knows that four liberal Justices dissented from Heller on precisely this point about an individual right. And apparently they still do. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the dissenters, told a luncheon of the Harvard Club in 2009 that their dissent was crafted with an eye to helping a ""future, wiser court"" overturn Heller.Sonia Sotomayor replaced David Souter in 2009, but she joined the liberal bloc on guns. The Supreme Court has over the years applied the Bill of Rights to the states as relevant cases presented themselves. Once Heller established an individual right to bear arms, every Court precedent called for applying it to the states in McDonald v. Chicago in 2010. The vote should have been 9-0. Yet the four liberals still dissented in McDonald -- confirming Justice Ginsburg's Harvard boast that they are waiting to overturn Heller.Justice Elena Kagan (who replaced John Paul Stevens) hasn't had a chance to rule on the individual right to bear arms, but don't expect her to be different. If Mrs. Clinton selects Antonin Scalia's replacement, she knows the Court's liberals will get their opportunity to overturn Heller. The Second Amendment really is on the ballot this November.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Hillary, Donald and the Second Amendment"" -- WSJ June 2, 2016)",8/22/16
"Election 2016: Republican Anxiety Lingers --- Trump's statement on judge is welcomed, but party leaders fear new controversies",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794728112?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsSen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of Senate Republicans' campaign arm, said he meant his comment ""keep walking"" as advice to presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump to keep backing away from his controversial comments about a federal judge who is presiding over lawsuits against Trump University. An Election 2016 article Thursday about Mr. Trump omitted the context of Sen. Wicker's remark.(WSJ June 10, 2016)Donald Trump's effort to defuse controversy over his criticism of a Latino federal judge was welcomed by fellow Republicans on Wednesday, but their relief was tempered by a recognition that their presumptive nominee might be always just one tweet away from another political eruption.Most Republicans view Mr. Trump's place at the top of the ticket as inevitable, but the latest controversy has revived questions among those who wish there were a way to install an alternative nominee.""Five more weeks of what we have seen in the last two weeks is going to end up in an uproar in the Republican convention and a public-relations debacle for Republicans,"" said Steve Lonegan, former New Jersey chairman of Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign.Mr. Trump tried on Tuesday to quell the firestorm over his comments that Indiana-born Judge GonzaloCuriel couldn't impartially oversee lawsuits against Trump University because he is of Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump issued a statement saying his criticism had been ""misconstrued"" as racist, but he didn't apologize. In a primary-night appearance, Mr. Trump avoided the issue, reading a scripted speech from a teleprompter.""It was a good speech and well-delivered and right on the content,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. But he added there were no guarantees Mr. Trump would stick to that tone. ""It's just one speech, one time. There's a long way between now and the election,"" he said.Whether or not the judge controversy fades, it has already kept the Trump campaign from taking advantage of a valuable political opportunity. Having cleared the GOP field in early May, Mr. Trump had a full month's head start over Democrat Hillary Clinton, who finally wrapped up her party's nomination this week.That gave Mr. Trump a lot of room to unify the party, organize his campaign and build a fundraising operation, but all three remain works in progress, and the party remains nearly as divided as it was when the New Yorker emerged as its front-runner.Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signaled Tuesday that his endorsement was contingent on Mr. Trump renouncing what he said about Judge Curiel. People like Mr. Lonegan are still rumbling about blocking his nomination at the July convention in Cleveland. Meanwhile, the Florida GOP has seen fit to put a big banner on his home page: ""IT'S TIME TO UNITE THE PARTY.""The Trump campaign staff has been split over strategic and personality issues. His fundraising operation is still getting started. Mr. Trump and his team will meet Thursday for the first time with all of the Republican National Committee's top fundraisers.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said on Wednesday, ""It is amazing how quickly the party has come together in support of Mr. Trump,"" given how long and contentious the primary season was. ""He will continue to unify Republican leadership leading up to the convention.""Some Republicans see the Trump campaign as having missed important opportunities to counter Mrs. Clinton recently: when a tough report came out about Mrs. Clinton's email practices as secretary of state; when job creation in May turned out to be much weaker than expected; and when Mrs. Clinton delivered a scathing speech against Mr. Trump's fitness for the presidency, which went largely unanswered by him and his allies.Most GOP officials see Mr. Trump's nomination as set in stone and are focusing on how to juggle the demands of keeping a distance from his controversial statements while not alienating his supporters and hurting their re-election bids.For many Republicans up for re-election, the goal in recent days has been to say as little as possible, quickening their pace when approached by reporters asking about the judge controversy.""Keep walking!"" advised Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of Senate Republicans' campaign arm.""Most Republicans understand that the less they talk about Donald Trump and the less news they make, the better it is for their campaign,"" said Josh Holmes, a former political adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Credit: By Janet Hook and Kristina Peterson",8/23/16
"Clinton Grooves a Pitch, Trump Whiffs",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794723670?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have pivoted to the general election -- and their attacks on each other so far suggest that the next 152 days will be ugly.Start with Mrs. Clinton. Last week in San Diego she gave what was billed as a major speech on foreign affairs. Yet in about 4,000 words she devoted only 714 to defending her record as secretary of state and 961 to articulating future policies. She spent 2,115 words -- 51% -- bashing Mr. Trump.Mrs. Clinton lacerated him for holding ""dangerously incoherent"" ideas and described him as ""temperamentally unfit"" for the presidency, ""not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes."" Her speech was focused, well constructed and (for her) adequately delivered. But in this era of social networks, voters collect information in diffuse ways; it will take more than one speech to firmly plant these impressions with voters.In turn, Mr. Trump must answer attacks more effectively. His response was surprisingly weak for someone who prides himself on being a counterpuncher. Mrs. Clinton's speech provided a treasure trove of subjects for him to punch back on: He could have attacked her for failing to reset U.S.-Russia relations, to end North Korea's nuclear program, to stop Libya from descending into chaos after Moammar Gadhafi's removal, or to keep ISIS from establishing a Middle East caliphate.Mr. Trump could have criticized her for backing the Iranian nuclear deal. He could have undermined her claim that she fought for ""better services for our veterans"" by quoting her statement last year that problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs weren't ""as widespread as it has been made out to be.""He could have offered voters a simple choice: If you like America's standing in the world today and believe in the Obama administration's foreign policy, vote for Hillary; if not, vote for Trump.Instead, Mr. Trump raged that her ""pathetic"" speech ""had nothing to do with foreign policy."" He then offered the press his chin. In her speech, Mrs. Clinton said that he would encourage Japan to acquire nuclear weapons. This, Mr. Trump, replied, was a lie. But in an April 3 interview on Fox News Sunday, he said that Japan might be better off defending itself, ""including with nukes.""Mr. Trump also attacked Mrs. Clinton for voting in favor of the Iraq war, boasting, ""I'm the one who didn't want to go in Iraq."" The record shows otherwise. After supporting the Iraq war before its 2003 start, Mr. Trump publicly opposed it only in the late summer of 2004.These missed opportunities suggest that Mr. Trump doesn't have advisers who look at Mrs. Clinton's utterances and suggest ways to go after her -- or who track his utterances and tell him to stop contradicting himself. His campaign badly needs discipline, a plan of attack, loads of research and robust rapid-response capability.In the months ahead, Mrs. Clinton will say that she is experienced and qualified, while Mr. Trump is risky, dangerous and repulsive. He will say that he represents the change voters crave, while she would be a third term for President Obama. They can't make these points only once or even episodically: Winning presidential candidates methodically and relentlessly prosecute their campaign's narrative, freshening and extending it every week.Both may find it difficult to mitigate their weaknesses. Mrs. Clinton must demonstrate that she understands and has something to say about the angst of voters who are concerned the country is rapidly going in the wrong direction. Mr. Trump must reassure Americans that he will bring change responsibly and safely, and will surround himself with qualified, experienced advisers.The candidates' speeches Tuesday showed they understand there's work to do. Mrs. Clinton's emphasized national unity, saying that America can move forward only if all its people prosper. Mr. Trump was modest and humble, inviting like-minded Americans to join his movement.This was welcome after a perfectly awful stretch in which the Republican obsessed about a ""Mexican"" judge (who was actually born in Indiana) that he claimed was treating him badly in the case against Trump University. (If that's true, protest in court: otherwise shut up.) Mr. Trump's reprehensible talk could have crippled him, and the next time it might. No more playing Lone Ranger: He must recruit truth-tellers and pros to his team.Mr. Trump has promised to give a major speech about Hillary on Monday, and the quality of his attack will speak volumes. Focusing on Vince Foster's death, Bill Clinton's adultery and a judge's ethnicity won't do it. Substantive attacks on her record, however, could keep the race close going into the conventions.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",8/23/16
Clinton Swipes at Trump on Economy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794723184?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- With the Democratic primary behind her, Hillary Clinton said she now plans to put Republican Donald Trump's business record and economic agenda at the center of her campaign, calling his ideas ""deeply misguided"" and ""dangerously incoherent.""In an interview Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said she would deliver an economic speech soon contrasting Mr. Trump's record and policies with her own. It will be modeled after a foreign-policy speech she gave last week where she used sometimes identical language to offer a biting critique of the presumptive Republican nominee, charging he was unfit to serve as commander-in-chief.""While he may have some catchy sound bites, his statements on the economy are dangerously incoherent,"" she said in the interview. ""They are deeply misguided, and they reflect an individual who is temperamentally unfit to manage the American economy.""Mr. Trump is hardly shrinking from the fight. He promised Tuesday night to deliver a ""major speech"" as early as Monday laying out the case for how Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have perfected what he called the ""politics of personal enrichment.""With the general election in effect now under way, the exchanges left no doubt that the next five months will be particularly bitter and divisive as both candidates strive to patch up divisions within their own parties while asserting the other shouldn't be president.For her own part, Mrs. Clinton promised in the interview to put forth a middle-class tax-cut plan, which she said would be a critical part of the case she makes to voters. She wouldn't say whether she supports bipartisan efforts to overhaul the corporate tax code by lowering rates and eliminating some tax breaks, but she promised more details in the weeks ahead.The interview came a day after the former first lady, senator and secretary of state made history as the first woman to claim the nomination of a major political party. She plans to travel to Ohio and Pennsylvania next week, two states where some analysts have predicted that Mr. Trump's brand of economic populism will resonate, particularly with white, working-class men.Mrs. Clinton said she was also working to unify Democrats. She spoke to rival Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator, on Tuesday evening and said she would continue making the case to his supporters that there is more that unites than divides them.While Mr. Sanders lost the contest, he succeeded in helping to push Mrs. Clinton to the left on some issues, including her stance on possible changes to the Social Security program, though she was also responding to a changing Democratic Party.During the long primary campaign, Mr. Sanders repeatedly hit Mrs. Clinton for her ties to Wall Street, including donations from employees of big banks and paid speeches.Asked if she would consider including people who have worked on Wall Street in her economic team, she said the question was premature but that she was ""not ruling in, not ruling out"" such an appointment.""I will always look for the best people when and if that opportunity arises, and I think there's a lot of people around the country, not just in one place in our country, with the kind of experience that would be useful,"" she said.Her economic address will come later this month, an aide said, but the candidate offered an unsparing preview on Wednesday, pointing to Mr. Trump's plan for large tax cuts, threats made to trading partners and his suggestion, later rescinded, that the U.S. might seek to renegotiate the national debt.""It's not hard to see how a Trump presidency couldactually lead to a serious global economic crisis,"" she said.A Trump spokeswoman said Mr. Trump, in his speech next week, would respond to ""the many inaccurate statements"" made by Mrs. Clinton.Polling suggests the Democrat has a tough task on the economy. While she is seen by voters as better able to handle foreign policy, on economic issues, Mr. Trump opens the general election with the edge, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling last month found.Asked about four economic issues, voters rated Mr. Trump as better equipped to handle three: dealing with Wall Street, trade and the economy overall. Mrs. Clinton drew the stronger marks only on which candidate could best look out for the middle class.Running for a third-straight Democratic term, Mrs. Clinton regularly says that President Barack Obama doesn't get the credit he deserves for rescuing the economy from the brink of collapse. But economic headwinds remain, and Mr. Trump has aimed his campaign squarely at voters who feel deep anxiety.""We are going to have fantastic trade deals,"" he said Tuesday evening. ""We're going to start making money and bringing in jobs.""Mrs. Clinton's style could hardly be more different. Over the course of the primary, she announced 53 different policy proposals totaling 201 pages, an aide said. She would use the tax code to deter short-term investing, encourage companies to share profits with their workers and ease burdens on the middle class through targeted credits.The open question is whether this raft of ideas is sufficiently blunt for the large chunk of voters who have lost confidence in the political system's ability to improve their lives. Facing an unconventional opponent in an unpredictable year, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that her approach might require deeper explanation. But she suggested the fact that she garnered more primary votes than either Mr. Trump or Mr. Sanders means Americans may be drawn to her wonkier approach.""I think it's clear we've got a lot of work to do, we're going to have a lot of explaining to do,"" she said. ""But it's important that voters know that, No. 1, I am listening, and I'm also learning about what will work . . . to make the economy stronger.""Credit: By Laura Meckler",8/23/16
Election 2016: Trump Brings New Voices to Bitter Debate --- The Republican cites support from families of victims of crime by illegal immigrants,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793855209?accountid=12768,"Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump is giving a national platform to parents of victims of crimes by illegal immigrants, inviting them to rallies and telling their tragic stories to boost support for hard-line immigration policies.Mr. Trump is drawing intense media attention to what he says is a public-safety issue caused by illegal immigration. But the families also help put a sympathetic face on Mr. Trump's attacks on some Mexican immigrants as criminals and his plans to build a wall along the southern border and deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally.Two weeks ago, Sabine Durden told thousands of people at a Trump rally in Anaheim, Calif., about her 30-year-old son, Dominic, a sheriff's dispatcher who was killed in a 2012 motorcycle accident by an illegal immigrant truck driver convicted twice of driving under the influence.Choking back tears, she recalled: ""I heard Donald Trump on the television as I walked by talking about illegal immigration and about the cost of American lives and I screamed. Donald Trump became my life savior that day, my hero.""In an interview, Mr. Trump said meeting the parents of children killed by illegal immigrants ""reinforced even more"" his support for stringent immigration laws.""Even I didn't realize how bad it was,"" he said. ""The only way people can understand how severe this crisis is is to see the families, and then they see the horror of it.""Mr. Trump's kinship with these grieving parents parallels Hillary Clinton's ties to several mothers of African-Americans killed in gun violence or in confrontations with police, including Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Michael Brown.The ""mothers of the movement"" have campaigned with Mrs. Clinton to push tougher gun-control laws and raise awareness about racial profiling.Two weeks after he flagged crime by illegal immigrants in his June 16, 2015,campaign announcement, 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle was slain in San Francisco, allegedly by a felon who had been deported five times. Mr. Trump seized on the murder as proof his focus on border security was on track.Ms. Steinle's brother, Brad, told CNN in July that Mr. Trump was ""sensationalizing"" her death. The Steinle family last week declined a request for comment on Mr. Trump through an attorney.Mr. Trump did find an ally in Jamiel Shaw, whose 17-year-old son was gunned down in 2008 by a gang member living illegally in the U.S. ""Donald Trump was right on,"" Mr. Shaw told Fox News last July. ""Donald Trump is like speaking for us, speaking for our dead.""Mr. Trump saw the Fox interview and called him. Days later, he met Mr. Shaw and other parents of children killed by illegal immigrants at a Beverly Hills, Calif., hotel.""He told me my son's death would not be in vain,"" said Mr. Shaw, a Democrat-turned-independent voter who owns a gym-equipment repair firm.Among the parents Mr. Trump is giving voice to are blacks and Hispanics, who bring a diverse face to a candidate facing allegations of racial and ethnic prejudice, most recently for accusing a Mexican-American judge of being biased against him. Mr. Shaw is African-American.Last year's Beverly Hills gathering was organized by Maria Espinoza, founder of the Remembrance Project, which advocates on behalf of such families. The Anti-Defamation League, which opposes discrimination, said in a 2014 report that the Remembrance Project ""demonizes immigrants."" Ms. Espinoza didn't respond to interview requests.Another parent who met Mr. Trump in Beverly Hills was Don Rosenberg, whose 25-year-old son was riding his motorcycle in San Francisco when he was struck and killed by an illegal immigrant driver in 2010.Mr. Rosenberg is grateful Mr. Trump is drawing attention to illegal immigration but said his inflammatory references to Mexicans as ""rapists"" muddles his message. The self-described liberal Democrat has pressed campaign advisers to offer more detailed policy plans.""Every speech can't be, 'We're going to build a wall and Mexico will pay for it. And Kate,'"" said Mr. Rosenberg, referring to Ms. Steinle in San Francisco.In the Journal interview, Mr. Trump attributed a ""staggering"" amount of crime to illegal immigration. But data is scarce. The federal government reports the ethnicity and race of offenders but not their legal status or country of origin.""On the question of whether illegal immigrants commit crimes out of proportion to their share of the population, it's very hard to say,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors curbs on legal immigration and stricter border enforcement.Mr. Camarota and other proponents of reduced immigration often point to a Government Accountability Office report in 2011 that found an estimated 296,000 immigrants here illegally or with unknown legal status in state and local jails. That count, which includes multiple incarcerations of the same person in different jurisdictions, covers violent and nonviolent offenses. There are estimated to be 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.Deportations remain at record-setting numbers under President Barack Obama, and more Mexicans are leaving the U.S. than entering it, according to the Pew Research Center. Mr. Trump's critics say his emphasis on crime tied to immigration is misguided.""Trump's attacks on immigrants and immigration are divisive, racist, and quite frankly, hearken back to some of the darkest periods in our nation's history,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum Action Fund, which backs citizenship for illegal immigrants.Credit: By Beth Reinhard",8/23/16
Election 2016: Trump's Tactic On Funding Puts RNC in Control,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795408885?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK -- Donald Trump is pursuing a financial strategy that would leave him largely reliant on party spending that he won't be able to fully control.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee convened his and the Republican National Committee's top fundraisers from each state Thursday at the Four Seasons hotel here. Collectively, they will raise money for the RNC, 11 state parties and the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump is set to attend several fundraisers for the committee in the coming weeks.Yet in raising money primarily for a committee that will transfer most of the money to the RNC, Mr. Trump is leaving himself largely dependent on the spending choices of others, since federal law limits coordination. The businessman, after mostly self-funding his primary, hasn't assembled his own finance operation that would raise money solely for his campaign.""Ideally what you want is a common theme and common message going across all your advertising,"" said Kevin Madden, an adviser to Republican Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign. ""When you cede some of that control or you don't have a direct command over it, then you can have messages or factions of the campaign competing against each other.""Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump's general-election rival, raised $60 million through March for a joint fundraising vehicle she set up with the Democratic National Committee and 32 state parties last August. Of that, just $12 million has been transferred to her campaign, the most allowed under campaign finance laws.But Mrs. Clinton has plenty of cash under her direct control: Her campaign raised $240 million through May.Mr. Trump through April lent his campaign $43 million and raised another $14 million.Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's campaign chairman, said after Thursday's meeting with fundraisers that he expected the campaign to have plenty of cash to finance the general-election battle, and that Mr. Trump wouldn't need to raise ""as much as people think.""RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer said using a joint fundraising committee is the quickest way for a candidate to raise money under current campaign-finance rules to benefit both the campaign and the party. ""It's more efficient and raises more net dollars,"" he said. Mr. Trump has also held some smaller fundraising events solely for his campaign.Still, the New Yorker will be the first nominee in recent history to outsource several core campaign functions to the RNC.That may carry some advantages for Mr. Trump: The party, unlike his campaign, has an established voter-contact operation and a field organization in battleground states, although it is small in comparison to the Democrats and nonexistent in several blue states, such as California, that Mr. Trump says he wants to make an effort to win.But it also means that the notoriously strong-willed candidate will have little input in many of the efforts to promote his candidacy.The RNC can spend up to $23.8 million on activities that it coordinates with the Trump campaign, according to FEC rules. The party doesn't need to include payments to field staff in that category, as long as the Trump campaign doesn't have a role in managing or directing the staff.Beyond that sum, the party can make independent expenditures that it doesn't coordinate with the campaign. In 2012, the party spent about $370 million in non-coordinated expenditures, including about $41 million in ads targeting President Barack Obama.Mr. Trump could continue to write checks to his campaign. But he has said he's not inclined to do so, and a Wall Street Journal analysis found that he doesn't have the ready cash available to finance a full general-election campaign.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",8/24/16
Election 2016: Trump's Business Plan Left Unpaid Bills,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795408861?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump often boasts on the presidential campaign trail that hardball tactics helped make him a successful businessman. His methods have also left behind bitter tales among business owners who say he shortchanged them.A review of court filings from jurisdictions in 33 states, along with interviews with business people, real-estate executives and others, shows a pattern over Mr. Trump's 40-year career of his sometimes refusing to pay what some business owners said Trump companies owed them.Larry Walters, whose Las Vegas drapery factory supplied Mr. Trump's hotel there eight years ago, said the developer, Trump Ruffin, wouldn't pay for additional work it demanded beyond the original contract. When Mr. Walters then refused to turn over some fabric, sheriff's deputies burst into his factory after Trump Ruffin sued him. Trucks took the fabric away.Mr. Walters said he never had payment problems with other casino or hotel clients. A review of Las Vegas court records showed no other legal disputes over payments involving him. Mr. Walters agreed to a settlement with Trump Ruffin that was about $380,000 short of what he said he was owed, court records show. He settled, he said, because ""they were going to drag it on for many, many years.""Mr. Trump, in interviews with The Wall Street Journal in May, said ""I love to hold back and negotiate when people don't do good work."" He said of Mr. Walters that the developers ""were unhappy with his work.""""If they do a good job, I won't cut them at all,"" Mr. Trump said of businesses he contracts with, saying ""it's probably 1,000 to one where I pay.""""I pay thousands of bills on time,"" he said, adding that suggesting otherwise is ""disgusting.""Mr. Trump's withholding of payments stood out as particularly aggressive in the industry and in the broader business world, said some vendors who had trouble getting paid.Mr. Trump pushed the approach into day-to-day casino operations, said Jack O'Donnell, president of Mr. Trump's Plaza casino in Atlantic City in the late 1980s. ""Part of how he did business as a philosophy was to negotiate the best price he could. And then when it came time to pay the bills,"" he said, Mr. Trump would say that "" 'I'm going to pay you but I'm going to pay you 75% of what we agreed to.' ""Executives at the casino paid vendors fully despite Mr. Trump's directives, he said, and ""it used to infuriate him.""Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, said he didn't know Mr. O'Donnell and that his account ""is certainly not a company philosophy."" He declined to discuss specifics of cases the Journal brought to his attention.Mr. Trump said the only unusual thing about his approach was that he pays bills faster than normal businesses. He said he sometimes gives bonuses for great work, and he agreed to provide names of such vendors.One, Lou Rinaldi, owns a Westchester, N.Y., pavement business and said he has worked on projects for about 15 years for Mr. Trump, who he says is a long-time golfing buddy. Mr. Trump has sometimes given him bonuses and handed cash to job-site workers, he said.Mr. Trump has written frequently about playing hardball. ""You have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors or they'll take the shirt right off your back,"" he wrote in his 1987 book ""The Art of the Deal.""Among Mr. Trump's satisfied suppliers is Bart Halpern Inc., a Manhattan fabric company that sold upholstery, drapery and pillow material to Trump projects. Bozena Dziewit, its director of hospitality sales, said it has always collected full payments promptly from Trump companies. ""We always have a very good experience.""Vendors with legal muscle have sometimes had better luck collecting, including several that sued Trump University, the now-defunct real-estate school. The MGM Grand in Las Vegas sued Trump University in Clark County, Nev., court in 2009 for allegedly failing to pay a $12,359.51 fee for a canceled event. The casino was paid and dropped the suit, an MGM spokesman said.Mr. Trump said of Trump University's bills: ""Everybody has been paid in full. I didn't have to do that either.""Some small businesses, such as Classic Chandeliers in West Palm Beach, Fla., decided they couldn't afford to fight. In 2004, Mr. Trump chose chandeliers from the store, said Judith Jacobson, who said she worked there with her ex-husband, Nicolas Jacobson, the owner.Mr. Trump's representatives negotiated to buy three chandeliers for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for $34,000 total with a 50% down payment, according to court records.Mr. Trump later sued Classic Chandeliers in Palm Beach County, Fla., court saying he shouldn't have to pay in full because the company didn't install the chandeliers properly. Mr. Jacobson, whose last name was spelled Jacobsen in the lawsuit, denied the claim.Court records show the suit was dropped in 2006 after a planned mediation. Ms. Jacobson said Mr. Jacobson agreed not to be paid in full rather than accumulate legal fees. The shop later closed. Mr. Jacobson died in 2015.Mr. Trump said of Mr. Jacobson: ""He was terrible, that guy . . . He didn't do the job properly.""New York real-estate broker Barbara Corcoran wrote in a 2003 book that Mr. Trump refused to pay her and associates a commission on a $100 million investment in a New York City real-estate project she helped secure in 1994. Of monthly payments he agreed to make over three years, she wrote, he paid two.Mr. Trump sued in New York County to cancel remaining payments and recover alleged damages after Ms. Corcoran's associates were quoted in a profile of him in New York magazine, court records show. The judge ruled against him.Ms. Corcoran's then-lawyer, Richard Seltzer, said: ""He took advantage of the legal system to try to avoid debts.""Mr. Trump said he sued Ms. Corcoran because her firm violated a confidentiality agreement and ""it wasn't a big deal.""Some vendors who did collect said Trump companies delayed payments beyond reason. Ted Sargetakis finally got paid 61 days late after many phone calls to collect a balance of more than $50,000 on fabric his Utah company, Silver State, sold to Mr. Trump's Las Vegas hotel. ""Typically for the larger customers, plus or minus a few days is not unusual,"" he said, ""but to be 30, 60, 70 days late, that's out of the norm.""Mr. Trump said he hadn't heard of Silver State. ""Is that a long time?"" he asked of a 70-day delay, adding that ""I pay thousands of bills on time.""Mr. Walters's drapery dispute took a bizarre turn when the sheriff's deputies presented a court order demanding he hand over fabric his company was using to make curtains, bedspreads and pillow covers for Trump International Hotel & Tower.The original order in 2007 had been for $702,958, court records show. Trump Ruffin, managed by Mr. Trump, pressed Mr. Walters to hurry, repeatedly asking for extra work, Mr. Walters said in court testimony and other court records.With the project mostly finished, the company paid Mr. Walters around $553,000 for a job he said had grown to $1.2 million. In March 2008, Trump Ruffin rejected his invoices for the extras, Mr. Walters told the Journal this year. He stopped the work and kept the fabrics as collateral.The company sued him to obtain the fabrics. Trump lawyers said in legal filings Mr. Walters didn't have proper paperwork to prove he was owed much of the money.Mr. Walters told the Journal he had complied with demands for extras, even without formal documentation, because he trusted the Trump company.Bill Langmade, CEO of Purchasing Management International, the agent that worked on behalf of Trump Ruffin on Mr. Walters's billing, said the onus is on vendors to have proper paperwork.Mr. Walters settled in 2008 for $185,000, court records show, collecting $823,000 in total before legal fees. In 2011, he closed the business, blaming the economic slump and Mr. Trump.---James Oberman, Melissa Korn, Peter Grant and Brody Mullins contributed to this article.Credit: By Alexandra Berzon",8/24/16
"Trump, the Judiciary and Identity Politics",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795404290?accountid=12768,"Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was born in Indiana to parents of Mexican origin and belongs to an association of lawyers of Mexican origin, is sitting on a case in the Southern District of California that charges fraud against Trump University. Donald Trump in recent days has attracted much attention by suggesting that Judge Curiel should be disqualified for bias because the judge's rulings are adverse to Mr. Trump and because, in campaigning for the presidency, the candidate has criticized Mexicans and proposed building a wall on the southwest U.S. border.Mr. Trump's claim against Judge Curiel is both baseless and squalid, but some in the chorus of critics are not themselves entirely without fault.First, let's dispose of the recusal question. Two statutes bear on recusal of a federal judge; neither remotely supports Mr. Trump's argument. One, and part of the other, treat recusal for bias in fact. To justify such a finding, the complainant must show that a judge has a financial interest in a case, or that the judge has a relationship with parties or lawyers in it. Sworn evidence of the judge's personal bias or prejudice is another justification for recusal. No evidence of such bias -- indeed no evidence at all -- has been submitted to the court by Mr. Trump or his lawyers.The remaining provision requires a judge to disqualify himself ""in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" The provision doesn't require a formal motion, but directs the judge to act, if necessary, on his own, as he would if he had a financial interest of which he was aware.There is case law on what circumstances suggest that a judge's impartiality ""might reasonably be questioned"" -- the key word of course being ""reasonably."" A judge is enjoined to weigh the importance of public confidence in the courts against the distinct possibility that someone questioning his impartiality might simply be seeking to avoid anticipated adverse consequences of his presiding over the case.That is, parties shouldn't use recusal as a device to judge-shop. Because the job of a judge is to rule, and rulings necessarily favor one party or the other, adverse rulings -- even a disproportionate number -- generally are not considered evidence of partiality.Race, religion and even gender have been used as suggested bases for ""reasonably"" questioning a judge's impartiality. Thus black judges, particularly those with professional histories before they took the bench that included civil-rights work, have been asked to recuse themselves in civil-rights cases. A female judge in the Southern District of New York in 1975 was challenged in a sex-discrimination case, as was a Mormon judge in a 1984 case that allegedly involved the ""theocratic power structure of Utah."" These challenges were rejected.I had the experience myself, when I was a federal judge, of being challenged by one defendant in a multidefendant case against Islamist terrorists who were eventually convicted of plotting a wave of violence in New York that included one (successful) murder, the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and plans to bomb several other landmarks. The defendant argued that I was a Jew and a Zionist; he sought information relating to my and my wife's ties to Israel; and he claimed that such information would show I could not be impartial.Like other judges before me, I had not much difficulty -- and no little satisfaction -- swatting away the claim, as Judge Curiel likely would if Mr. Trump's claim were ever put before him for decision. Whether or not Judge Curiel would use the ""r"" word -- racist -- it would certainly simmer just below the surface. After all, suggesting that a judge would allow his ethnic ancestry to govern his rulings is simply unacceptable in America.Or is it?Following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. When some on the left questioned the nomination of a man in his 60s who is of the Jewish faith, the president conceded that Judge Garland is indeed ""a white guy, but he's a really outstanding jurist."" Note the ""but,"" which may well have been inserted for the benefit of the questioner, and perhaps in a mild jest, but it is nonetheless there, whether meant to represent the president's values or those of his interlocutor.Before her 2009 elevation to the Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor once gave a speech saying that she hoped ""a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" The president who appointed her said he was seeking judges who have ""empathy"" with those who appear before them.Such pronouncements reflect how identity politics have become, increasingly and inappropriately, a part of the conversation surrounding courts and judges.Whether they know it or not, judges demonstrate symbolically every time they mount the bench that personal considerations have no place in deciding cases. Their black robes are supposed to suggest that judges are all the same, that it doesn't matter -- or shouldn't -- whose head is popping up from beneath the black crepe. It matters, of course, but the symbolism inherent in the robe marks at least an aspiration. Donald Trump's claims may be the dirty underside of what we get when we abandon that aspiration, but they are by no means the whole of it.---Mr. Mukasey served as U.S. attorney general (2007-09) and as a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York (1988-2006).Credit: By Michael B.

Trump Can't Wing It Forever,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795403495?accountid=12768,"The problem with accomplishing the impossible is that it leaves the impression doing so can be routine. In that mind-set may rest the question of whether Donald Trump has a shot at the presidency.Give the man credit: He broke every law of political physics and still won the primary. He rambled; he barely spent a dime on TV; he skipped entire states; he ignored delegate math; his focus group was himself. An entire generation of political consultants is debating checking in to a psych ward.His impossible victory in hand, Mr. Trump is proceeding as if he can win the general election the same way. Fundraising and advertising? Mr. Trump told Bloomberg that he had no plans to raise the $1 billion his campaign initially estimated, since ""I get so much publicity"" and free airtime. He wrapped up the nomination more than a month ago, yet only this week did his national finance team hold its first official meeting.A data operation? The real-estate mogul last month said the whole know-who-your-voters-are thing is ""overrated."" After all, he says he can reach nearly 20 million people on social media. How about a fully staffed campaign operation? No need. Mr. Trump is running a bare-bones effort -- reported to be about 80 people in total -- and he told the New York Times that such leanness is ""smart.""In short, he's winging it. He continues to operate on the assumption that he will bask in free airtime forever, that the masses will flock to him come November, that he can tweet his way to the Oval Office. And perhaps, given his primary achievement, he gets the benefit of the doubt.Save one thing: It isn't working. Mr. Trump's past rule-breaking succeeded because of a crowded primary field, in which Mr. Trump was the most entertaining figure, and in which the press didn't have a stake. It succeeded because a decade of specific frustrations had made conservatives unusually open to his style and message.That's all over now. Mr. Trump is in a race against a seasoned politician who commands a machine and is already savaging him daily. The mainstream media are in the tank for her, and their airtime will be devoted to skewering him. Mr. Trump's supporters remain the minority in a fractured party that he has yet to unify.There's no need to guess whether Mr. Trump's lack of a campaign is hurting him. It's proven by two irrefutable weeks of negative press coverage, missed opportunities and eroding poll numbers.Campaigns exist to keep the candidate focused and ready to exploit rare opportunities. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump wasted three such golden moments: the report by the State Department's inspector general on Mrs. Clinton's email practices; Hillary's foreign policy speech; and last week's dismal jobs report.Mr. Trump could have hammered the Clinton ethical morass and wrapped Barack Obama's failed foreign and economic policies around Mrs. Clinton's neck. Instead he confined himself to random tweets, calling the email report ""devastating,"" the jobs report a ""bombshell,"" and Hillary's teleprompter skills unpresidential.Campaigns exist to stop the candidate from digging himself into a hole, as Mr. Trump has with highly personal attacks on the judiciary. They exist to tee up a regular series of addresses on key issues, much like Mr. Trump did (admirably) on energy policy several weeks ago. (The mogul reportedly will give a major address next week on the Clintons' ""politics of personal enrichment,"" which is at least a start.)Campaigns exist to counter negative advertising. But the blitz that the Clinton camp commenced against Mr. Trump as far back as April has largely gone unanswered. The super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton has spent millions and vowed another $130 million. Her campaign, with an estimated $60 million in hand, had an ad up within days of the judge controversy. The Trump campaign has run one Web ad -- weeks ago -- about the Clintons, which hit Bill for his sexual past.Campaigns exist to shore up the party, yet there are renewed rumblings about ditching Mr. Trump at the convention. They exist to work hand in hand with party leaders: The Republican National Committee has invested years and millions preparing for this race, but it can be of little help in the absence of an all-cylinders Trump campaign.Mr. Trump boasts that he is a business success, and so he surely understands the necessity of a well-oiled operation. Were he to spend the next weeks focused on gearing up one, he'd even the odds against Hillary and make inroads among many Republicans who need reasons to feel confident.What could it hurt? If Mr. Trump is as skilled as his supporters believe, imagine him also backed by a fabulous campaign.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",8/24/16
New Trump Hotels Skip the Name,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794311424?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has put his name on everything from bottled water and fragrances to airlines and vineyards -- but don't look for it on his new chain of hotels.The new brand will cater to the technologically savvy younger generation, a group among which Mr. Trump hasn't polled well as a Republican presidential candidate. It also won't be quite as high-end as Trump Hotels' luxury properties.The company hasn't yet unveiled what it will be called, but does say it will avoid using the Trump name to head off any possible confusion.""We want to reserve the name Trump only for luxury and never want to confuse customers or owners of the difference in a four- and five-star property,"" Trump Hotels Chief Executive Eric Danziger said.The move is a departure for the New York businessman and presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who has long delighted in plastering his personal brand on hotels, casinos, golf courses and condominiums.Of the 564 entities Mr. Trump listed in his latest financial-disclosure form, around 426 carried the Trump name or his initials. Many of these are relatively obscure limited liability companies attached to his real-estate holdings.Mr. Trump also has launched a range of lifestyle and consumer products, all branded with the same five letters. There is Trump Natural Spring Water, served at Trump hotels and restaurants. There is Success by Trump, an eau de toilette spray that captures ""the spirit of the driven man."" Trump Steaks were once sold through the retailer Sharper Image's catalog.Trump Vodka debuted in 2006 with the slogan ""Success Distilled,"" but the brand was discontinued. And for more than a decade until it dropped the partnership last year, Macy's Inc. carried items from the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection, including cuff links, ties and dress shirts.Mr. Trump's hotel business has special status, however. While many of his other ventures are primarily licensing agreements that require little or no cash from the Trumps, the family has put its own money into the hotel company. It owns some of its hotels, including those in Miami and Washington, and has stakes in others.Trump Hotels also represents the next generation of the family business, called the Trump Organization. It has been run by three of his children: Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, who each hold the title of executive vice president. Last year, the company hired Mr. Danziger, a hospitality veteran, as its first CEO of its luxury-hotel-management company, Trump Hotels.The hotel business itself is facing a generational and technological shift in the form of increased competition from Airbnb, the room-rental service favored by younger Americans. That is a group for whom the Trump brand doesn't resonate, and the contentious presidential campaign is widening the gap.""Traditionally, the Trump brand has been associated with luxury and glamour and privilege, but in a very aspirational sense,"" said Susan Federspiel, strategy director at brand consulting firm Landor.Mr. Trump's remarks on immigration and other issues have made the brand ""more polarizing,"" Ms. Federspiel said, and ""in some cases less likable.""Mr. Trump is having trouble getting younger people on board to vote for him in the campaign. A poll this spring by Harvard University's Institute of Politics found that among likely voters between the ages of 18 and 29, 61% would vote for Hillary Clinton and 25% would vote for Mr. Trump. The remainder said they were unsure how they would vote.Landor's research suggests that millennials put high value on their brands being responsible and inclusive. They like to hold their brands accountable, and that would go for a lodging chain targeting their youthful cohort as well, Ms. Federspiel said.""If his company or business is thinking about a hotel chain, it's not the best idea to put his name on it,"" she said.Credit: By Craig Karmin and Anupreeta Das",8/24/16

After one layoff, the Hickory machinist studied architecture at a community college but then couldn't find a job and returned to the furniture industry. He makes $45,000 a year, the same as he did nearly 20 years ago and $14,000 a year poorer after adjusting for inflation.Mr. Shoun's son, Steven, a trained furniture upholsterer, manages a junkyard and discourages his own son, now in college, from working in the industry that gave North Carolina the nickname ""Furniture Capital of the World."" Steven Shoun says he blames ""the people who run our country and who run our companies"" for Hickory's economic turmoil.Mr. Shoun and his father say they favor Donald Trump for president, even though they don't plan to vote. ""I don't think one vote will make any difference,"" says Stuart Shoun.When import booms from Japan, Mexico and Asian ""tiger"" economies such as Taiwan arrived in the U.S., many cities and towns were able to adapt.China was different. Its emergence as a trade powerhouse rattled the American economy more violently than economists and policy makers anticipated at the time or realized for years later. The U.S. workforce adapted more slowly than expected.What happened with Chinese imports is an example of how much of the conventional wisdom about economics that held sway in the late 1990s, including the role of trade, technology and central banking, has since slowly unraveled.The aftershocks are sowing deep-seated political discontent this election year. Disillusionment with globalization has fed one of the most unconventional political seasons in modern history, with Bernie Sanders and especially Donald Trump tapping into potent anti-free-trade sentiment.Both presidential candidates aimed much of their criticism at 1994's North American Free Trade Agreement, which boosted imports from Mexico. Even then, though, the real culprit was China, economists now say.Many U.S. factories that moved to Mexico did so to match prices from China. Some of the new Mexican factories helped support U.S. jobs. For example, fabrics made in the U.S. are turned into clothing in Mexico for sale globally by U.S. companies.David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who has studied trade, labor markets and technological change, calls China's economy a ""500-ton boulder perched on a ledge."" At some point, it would tumble and splatter what was below, but ""you just didn't know when,"" he says.Economists have long argued that while free trade creates winners and losers, the net results are beneficial. Americans gained from inexpensive imports and filled their homes with low-price bicycles, jewelry and kitchenware. U.S. companies won access to overseas markets.Workers in industries exposed to imports were expected to upgrade their job skills or move somewhere offering fresh opportunities.Japan's invasion in the 1970s largely hit industries in cities with broad manufacturing bases on which to fall back. In Akron, Ohio, long the center of the U.S. tire industry , chemists trained at the University of Akron helped create a local polymer industry that employs tens of thousands of workers, said David Lieberth, a former Akron deputy mayor who chronicles the city's history.China upended many of those assumptions. No other country came close to its combination of a vast working-age population, super-low wages, government support, cheap currency and productivity gains.Imports from China as a percentage of U.S. economic output doubled within four years of China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. Mexico took 12 years to do the same thing after Nafta. Japan took just as long after becoming a major U.S. supplier in 1974.By last year, imports from China equaled 2.7% of U.S. gross domestic product, a percentage point larger than Japan or Mexico ever won.Japan's import wave also challenged a limited group of advanced manufacturing industries, largely autos, steel and consumer electronics. China's low-cost imports swept the entire U.S., squeezing producers of electronics in San Jose, Calif., sporting goods in Orange County, Calif., jewelry in Providence, R.I., shoes in West Plains, Mo., toys in Murray, Ky., and lounge chairs in Tupelo, Miss., among many other industries and communities.""If we encouraged China to trade, we needed domestic policies in place that would minimize the impact that would follow,"" says Gordon Hanson, a University of California, San Diego economics professor. He calls the lack of such policies ""a catastrophic mistake.""A group of economists that includes Messrs. Hanson and Autor estimates that Chinese competition was responsible for 2.4 million jobs lost in the U.S. between 1999 and 2011. Total U.S. employment rose 2.1 million to 132.9 million in the same period.In the 2000s, congressional districts where competition from Chinese imports was rapidly increasing became more politically polarized, the two researchers and two coauthors concluded from examining vote totals. ""Ideologically strident"" candidates replaced moderates, they wrote in a paper.In this year's Republican presidential primary races, Mr. Trump won 89 of the 100 counties most affected by competition from China, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. Those counties include Hickory's Catawba County, where Mr. Trump got 44% of the Republican vote in the March primary against 11 other candidates.Mr. Sanders won Democratic primaries in 64 of the 100 most-exposed counties in northern and Midwestern states. That pattern didn't hold in the South, where Hillary Clinton was strong among black voters.Hickory, a quiet city of about 40,000 people, used to have a smell redolent of wood lacquer. It was a boomtown in the late 1990s. Foreign competition challenged the local apparel industry, but furniture thrived.Furniture makers figured they were relatively safe from imports because their products were bulky, expensive to ship and often involved hand-craftsmanship. Then shipping costs fell, and many Americans chose low prices above all else.Manufacturing employment in Catawba County and surrounding areas shrank to 38,000 in 2014 from 79,000 in 2000. Nearly half the decline was caused by lost furniture jobs.Last year, total U.S. imports of furniture and fixtures from China reached $20.4 billion, up from $4.4 billion in 2000, the Census Bureau estimates. Especially hard hit were communities in North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Iowa and Wisconsin.The U.S. now imports 73.5% of all furniture it consumes, according to Jerry Epperson, an analyst at investment bank Mann, Armistead & Epperson Ltd. in Richmond, Va. More than half of that percentage comes from China.""We were all pretty surprised by the speed,"" says Alex Bernhardt Jr., chief executive of Bernhardt Furniture Co., a family-owned manufacturer based in Lenoir, N.C., about 17 miles from Hickory.Mr. Bernhardt and other furniture makers say they inadvertently helped China by dispatching technicians to its factories to offer guidance. American furniture companies also sent tools, parts and instructions to China to build intricate, machine-made products there.Alex Shuford, 42, the CEO of family-owned RHF Inc., which owns Century Furniture and is based in Hickory, says the help U.S. manufacturers gave China ""was like Ford helping Toyota.""Century and Bernhardt survived by focusing their U.S. production on made-to-order goods, especially upholstered furniture. Bernhardt now has 1,600 employees in North Carolina, down from 2,800 in 2000, while Century has shrunk to 845 workers in the state from 1,323 in 2003.U.S. policies to deal with Chinese trade failed, including efforts to collect import duties. In 2004, a coalition of furniture makers won a trade case against China and collected $309 million in tariffs.Stanley Furniture Co., of High Point, N.C., received the biggest payout, which totaled $83.5 million, but had just 71 workers left in the U.S. as of last year, compared with 2,600 a decade earlier. Stanley spent heavily on a U.S.-made line of children's furniture, but it flopped .""We invested millions in the effort to save jobs,"" says Stanley President and Chief Executive Glenn Prillaman.Stuart Shoun, the Hickory machinist, says he was a 20-year-old ""hillbilly"" in search of steady work when he moved to Hickory from Mountain City, Tenn., in 1977. Roads to jobs in Hickory were called the Hillbilly Highway.When layoffs hit, Mr. Shoun was surprised some coworkers asked for help deciphering instructions because they couldn't read or write. ""How would they even go and fill out [job] applications?"" he recalls thinking.He was recruited to run a furniture plant in China and could have doubled his salary to about $100,000. ""The offer said to me: 'You might want to get out of North Carolina and go to China because that's where the industry is going,' "" he says. He didn't want to leave his family and turned down the job.During earlier import surges, American cities and workers remade themselves. Detroit rebounded from Japanese competition in the 1980s, with auto maker Chrysler and leader Lee Iacocca emerging as symbols of American revival. Chrysler is now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.Laid-off workers adjusted more slowly to the China shock. In Hickory and across the U.S., fewer uprooted themselves in search of job opportunities elsewhere, migration data show. Economists cite the increase in two-income families, the aging population, housing bust and skyrocketing housing costs in places such as San Francisco and Austin, Texas.Government efforts for laid-off workers haven't helped much. Washington's formal program to retrain workers hurt by import competition, called Trade Adjustment Assistance, pays for two years of college tuition and extends unemployment-insurance payouts.A 2012 evaluation ordered by the Labor Department found that program participants, especially those older than 50, generally made less money four years after starting the program than those who didn't sign up. The others went back to work more quickly.Mr. Shuford, Century's chief executive, calls the job-relief program a ""Band-Aid for an economy that has a sliced artery.""In Hickory, laid-off workers went to community college but often came away without jobs in other industries. After losing his job in 2006, Mr. Shoun figured that learning architectural design would help him get a better job. The housing market collapsed by the time he finished his training in 2008. He went back to the furniture business.His ex-wife, Michelle Surratt, an eighth-grade dropout who lost her job in 2006, used Trade Adjustment Assistance to start earning a high-school diploma but never took the required math test because she was ""scared about numbers,"" she says.Ms. Surratt, 58, earns $9.69 an hour repairing furniture fabric. About 15 years ago, she made about $1 an hour more as a machine operator.Many workers figure they aren't cut out for college and turn to Social Security Disability after years of grinding factory work. Between 2000 and 2013, the number of Catawba County residents on disability rose 86%, compared with increases of 61% in North Carolina and 65% in the U.S.Anthony ""Tony"" Crawford, an upholsterer, tore a knee and hurt his back tripping over wooden frames on a furniture-factory floor in 2009. During the boom, he made $29 an hour and worked overtime shifts for more money.Mr. Crawford, 45, now lives on a fraction of his old income. ""I made my money with my hands,"" he says. ""Back to school wasn't an option.""In recent years, Hickory has shown signs of revival. The jobless rate was 5% in June, slightly higher than the U.S. Much of the improvement in Hickory's unemployment rate is due to the area's labor force shrinking by about 25,000 jobs, or 13%, since 2001. That means there are fewer people to count as unemployed.Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. have set up data centers, some on a stretch of U.S. 321 long called Furniture Row. Those operations don't employ many people. Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc.'s 48,000-square-foot data center has 10 workers.Bernhardt, facing a shortage of skilled labor, now advertises for upholsterers at movie theaters and offers signing bonuses of $1,000.Mr. Autor, the MIT economist, says the worst is probably over now that wages in China are rising and production has begun shifting to lower-cost countries , including Vietnam. That makes little difference to Hickory's furniture-industry casualties, few of whom are likely to regain the economic ground they lost.""What we heard was China, China, China,"" says Lonnie Joiner, Mr. Shoun's former boss. ""I blamed the large corporations and their greed.""Mr. Joiner says he supports Mr. Trump, who won him over with ""raw honesty and brashness"" and his tough talk on trade.Write to Bob Davis at bob.davis@wsj.com and Jon Hilsenrath at jon.hilsenrath@wsj.comCredit: By Bob Davis and Jon Hilsenrath",8/25/16
"Clinton, Trump Duel on Abortion",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795833917?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton plunged into general-election combat on Friday, and immediately showed voters the starkly different choices they represent in their views of abortion, women's issues and the Supreme Court's future.Speaking in Washington, D.C., to core political constituencies at almost the same time, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton tried to energize their supporters with a fearsome vision of what would happen if their opponent wins the presidential election in the fall.The Republican Mr. Trump, speaking to a conference of evangelical conservatives, warned Mrs. Clinton would ""appoint radical judges"" to the Supreme Court -- the top concern for many of the antiabortion activists in the audience.""She will push for federal funding for abortion on demand,"" he said at a conference organized by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a group of religious conservatives.Mrs. Clinton, delivering her first campaign speech since wrapping up the Democratic contest this week, warned that abortion rights and other women's priorities would be imperiled under a Trump presidency.""When Donald Trump says, 'Let's make America great again,' that is code for 'Let's take America backward,'"" she said in a speech to Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the political arm of the women's health organization. ""Well, Donald, those days are over.""The split-screen day of campaign events was the first clear-cut round of general-election sparring, now that the two parties have their presumptive nominees. Mr. Trump cleared his field of rivals a month ago, whereas Mrs. Clinton conducted a two-front battle until this week against the New York businessman and her primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.The dueling events underscore how a central issue for mobilizing voters in both parties will be concern about the future composition of the Supreme Court, which has been short one member since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this year.President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, a U.S. appeals court judge, to succeed Justice Scalia. Republicans have said they won't hold a vote to confirm him, because they believe the next president should fill the vacancy that could shift the court toward a progressive stance or restore its previous conservative majority. Democrats say that the GOP refusal to act is politically motivated obstructionism.Mr. Trump spoke to the evangelical group as part of a broader effort to win over a sometimes-wary core constituency that is important to GOP grass-roots mobilization.Although Mr. Trump, the thrice-married billionaire who used to support abortion rights, isn't a natural fit for many social conservatives, he gained leverage from the fact that many in the audience cared more than anything about who will pick the next justices on the Supreme Court.""It's down to two choices now, and he has to be our choice,"" said Debbie Lawrence, a 64-year-old from Arkansas. ""I'm not going to be on his campaign, but I will encourage conservative evangelicals to vote for him, even if we're not sure he's in the same camp with us.""In his speech, Mr. Trump pointed to what was perhaps his most important step of his campaign toward easing concerns on the religious right: the list he released last month of judges with conservative credentials whom he would consider for the vacancy.Mr. Trump made no mention of the controversy that has been dogging his campaign for weeks, the allegations of racism in response to his claim that the federal judge overseeing litigation about Trump University cannot be impartial because of the judge's Mexican heritage.Mr. Trump read his speech almost entirely from a teleprompter -- the latest sign that he is taking seriously Republicans who have urged him to rein in his freewheeling speaking style.For Mrs. Clinton, opening her face-off with Mr. Trump at a Planned Parenthood event drew attention to her historic status as the first female nominee of a major party.The speech is part of a concerted effort by Mrs. Clinton and her campaign to rally support among women, where she enjoys an advantage, and in particular to win over Republican-leaning, suburban women who might otherwise not support a Democrat for president.The former secretary of state and New York senator pointed to past comments where Mr. Trump insulted women as ""pigs,"" ""dogs"" and ""disgusting animals"" and called pregnant women an inconvenience for employers.""Donald assures us as president he will be 'the best' for women,"" she said. ""Anyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood and wipe out safe and legal abortion has no idea what's best for women. It's kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights.""Her remarks were a full-throated endorsement for her host, Planned Parenthood, which has come under attack from Republicans in Washington and many state capitals, because it is the nation's largest abortion provider, though most of its services are for other women's health issues. Eleven states have cut funding for the organization.Democrats are counting on that becoming a winning issue, as it was in 2012, when the president made backing for the group central to his pitch to women. Many women associate Planned Parenthood with contraception, not abortion, and many have personally used its services at one time.""I've been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time. And as president, I will always have your back,"" Mrs. Clinton said.In pointing to the importance of the Supreme Court, Mrs. Clinton noted that a Texas law imposing strict requirements on abortion providers is now under review. She also criticized Mr. Trump's comments, later retracted, that women who have abortions should be penalized.""Anyone who would so casually agree to the idea of punishing women . . . that is someone who doesn't hold women in high regard,"" she said. ""Because if he did, he'd trust women to make the right decisions for ourselves.""Enlarge this image.Credit: By Janet Hook, Laura Meckler and Beth Reinhard",8/25/16
Trump and the 'Mexican' Judge,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1793856122?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump keeps giving his political opponents ammunition, most recently with his continuing attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over lawsuits against Trump University. But it's important to distinguish between what is merely obnoxious and the truly odious in his remarks.Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the judge as ""unfair"" and ""a hater."" He has also threatened a civil case against the judge if he becomes President, adding that because Judge Curiel is ""of Mexican heritage"" he has ""an inherent conflict of interest."" The media have offered Mr. Trump opportunities to retreat, but he keeps insisting that ethnicity disqualifies the judge from ruling fairly because the Republican favors building a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border.Democrats and their media allies are trying to portray this as an attack on ""judicial independence,"" but criticizing the judiciary is neither new nor beyond the pale. Perhaps they've forgotten that President Obama slammed the Supreme Court for its Citizens United ruling in 2010 while the Justices were a captive audience during the State of the Union address.Mr. Obama also contributed to the Democratic intimidation campaign against Chief Justice John Roberts ahead of the 2012 ObamaCare ruling. ""I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress,"" the President said at an April 2012 press conference. The Chief Justice ruled as the President recommended.We and others criticized those attacks on the judiciary at the time. If our great progressive moralists were outraged, we must have missed it. However, the left has long wanted to make progressive judges off-limits to political criticism, which explains the attempts to conflate Mr. Trump's comments with criticizing any judge ever.Mr. Trump is attacking Judge Curiel in a personal business case, not a political one, and as a candidate for President we think he should be above this kind of pettiness. His implied threat against the judge if he becomes President is more obnoxious, though we doubt he could do much about it in office. The political blowback would rightly be enormous.What elevates Mr. Trump's remarks to the reprehensible is his equation of ethnicity with bias. That truly is an attack on the independence of the judiciary because it means that a judge can be disqualified from a case merely for his personal background, rather than for any material conflict of interest.The suit against Trump University is a classic civil fraud case that has nothing to do with ethnicity. Judge Curiel happens to be an American born in Indiana to immigrant parents, but that is of no legal import. He shouldn't be judged by the ancestry of his parents any more than Chief Justice Roberts should be barred from ruling on religious liberty cases like the Little Sisters of the Poor because he is a Roman Catholic.As a legal matter this is well established, notably in a 1998 case (MacDraw v. CIT) in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. A litigant challenged the fairness of Judge Denny Chin due to his ethnicity. Judge Chin responded by slapping down the complaint and sanctioning the lawyers, and he was backed by the appellate judges. ""Courts have repeatedly held that matters such as race or ethnicity are improper bases for challenging a judge's impartiality,"" wrote Judge Ralph Winter, a highly regarded conservative appointed by Ronald Reagan.Apart from his racist implications, Mr. Trump is also indulging in the left's habit of attributing the motivations of everyone and everything to race, class, gender and sexual orientation. Claiming that a person's judgment is determined by his objective circumstances is a Marxist trope. Isn't Mr. Trump supposed to be running against such thinking?The hopeful news is that Mr. Trump's attack on Judge Curiel's ethnicity has been widely denounced, notably by senior Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Unlike many of our outraged progressives, they are politically consistent. As for Mr. Trump, he should let his lawyers argue his civil case, apologize to the judge, and start talking about the economy.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Trump, the 'Mexican' Judge and Wise Latinas"" -- WSJ June 13, 2016)",8/25/16
"Trump Goes On Offensive, Links Obama To Extremists",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796118056?accountid=12768,"GOFFSTOWN, N.H. -- Donald Trump suggested Monday that President Barack Obama may be sympathetic to radical Islamists he said inspired the gunman in this weekend's Orlando, Fla., nightclub attack, alleging in a television interview the president ""doesn't get it or he gets it better than anybody understands.""In an address in New Hampshire Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump used a broad brush to attack both the president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for what he claims are lax immigration laws that contributed to the Florida attack that killed 49 people.""The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here,"" Mr. Trump said during his a speech here, referring to the New York-born shooter, Omar Mateen, whose parents emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan.The presumptive Republican nominee's remarks on Fox News earlier in the day mark the latest escalation in his yearslong campaign to paint Mr. Obama as unqualified for office, either by birth or by virtue of his leadership. Mr. Trump spent much of Mr. Obama's first term in office alleging the president wasn't a natural-born U.S. citizen despite Mr. Obama's official Hawaiian birth certificate.""Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind,"" Mr. Trump said on Fox News. ""And the something else in mind -- you know, people can't believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on. It's inconceivable. There's something going on.""His remarks drew a rebuke from the White House. Press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama's record on fighting Islamic State ""speaks for itself"" and ""includes a lot of dead terrorists,"" as well as an international coalition to confront the group.""This president has, time and time again, sought to advance our interests, to strengthen our alliances and, where necessary, order our military to take action to protect the American people. And the president has done that in a way that is smart, that is tough and has made our country safer,"" he said.Clinton campaign manager John Podesta also lashed out, saying Mr. Trump's speech ""offered some disturbing insights into the dangers of a Trump White House. Nothing in his rambling remarks came close to resembling a real strategy for fighting terrorists and keeping our people safe.""The sharp exchange suggests that Mr. Trump will take aim during the campaign at both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, who has said he would work hard to help get her elected.It also coincides with his campaign's attempts to reset itself after spending a week defending -- and revising -- his accusation that a U.S.-born judge of Mexican descent couldn't fairly oversee a lawsuit against the presumptive GOP nominee because of his proposal to build a wall on the southern border.Mr. Trump's team also banned the Washington Post from covering its events on Monday after charging that it wrote a headline on his Fox News interview that he deemed unfair. His campaign called it ""a perfect example of inaccurate coverage"" by the newspaper.Washington Post Editor Marty Baron said in a statement that the move ""is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press."" He said the Post will continue to cover Mr. Trump ""as it has all along -- honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly.""In addressing the Florida assault in New Hampshire, Mr. Trump appeared to broaden his pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country by including immigrants from any country ""with a proven history of terrorism against the U.S., Europe or our allies.""Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton -- and some leading Republicans -- have criticized such a ban, saying it is counterproductive and feeds the recruitment pitches of terrorist groups. In an Ohio speech, the former secretary of state called for more outreach to Islamic communities and denounced ""inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric.""Mr. Trump said as president he would suspend immigration from any countries or regions that could present a threat to the U.S. And he warned that if Americans ""don't get tough"" about the country's immigration laws ""we're not going to have our country anymore.""Mr. Trump, who has been widely accused of stoking ethnic and racial divisions throughout his campaign, cast his proposal to bar Muslim immigrants as an inclusive, All-American effort to protect women and people targeted for their sexual orientation.---Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Reid J.

Shooting Heightens Trump-Clinton Divide,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795819703?accountid=12768,"The mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., elevated an issue that Republican Donald Trump has been stressing throughout his presidential campaign: the threat posed by jihadists bent on killing Americans at home.Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, on Sunday emphasized other dynamics. She said the U.S. must work with ""allies and partners"" to foil terrorists. She also made note of the gay and lesbian targets of the killings, denouncing ""an act of hate"" against a community that is part of the political coalition she hopes will help her defeat Mr. Trump.""We will keep fighting for your right to live free, openly and without fear,"" she said.With images from Orlando blanketing TV screens, Mr. Trump stressed in a series of tweets that the attack came from an Islamic extremist and suggested conventional Democratic policies backed by President Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton are inadequate to the task of wiping out terrorism.""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,"" he wrote in one.Mr. Obama condemned what he called an ""act of terror and an act of hate,"" calling on Americans to stand united in the wake of the deadliest shooting rampage in the country's history.The Orlando attack is the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken Americans in recent years, including the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting and the Fort Hood shootings in Texas.""Trump's strength arises from frustration and fear,"" said Michael Oren, a historian and former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. The Orlando massacre ""deepens the fear and heightens the frustration that many Americans do not feel safe.""Mr. Trump has ground to make up when it comes to persuading voters he would do a better job than Mrs. Clinton keeping the nation safe. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last month showed that registered voters believed by a 10-point margin the former secretary of state would be a better commander-in-chief.Since entering the race, Mr. Trump has taken a hard-line stance on terrorism that proved popular in the GOP primary fight. He called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and promised that he would ""quickly and decisively bomb the hell out of ISIS."" He also faulted Mr. Obama for a strategy that, he said, is ""losing the war on terrorism.""The Muslim ban has come under widespread criticism and Mr. Trump last month described the ban as merely a proposal. But Trump advisers believe the mass slaughter at a gay bar in Orlando -- carried out by a man who pledged allegiance to Islamic State -- will help demonstrate that Mr. Trump is bringing a plain-spoken urgency to the issue of terrorism that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton both lack.Indeed, he seems to be embracing the Muslim ban anew. In another tweet Sunday, he wrote: ""Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough."" In a separate statement Sunday, he said: ""I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct any more."" He said he planned a speech on terrorism, immigration and national security on Monday.Not since 2004, when Osama bin Laden issued a videotape weeks before the contest between President George W. Bush and John Kerry, has terror been such a prominent campaign issue, said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University in Washington. ""It's in the interests of these groups to provoke polarization in our society,"" he said.A former GOP rival whom Mr. Trump defeated, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, issued a statement calling for a more aggressive approach. ""It is a time for action,"" he said.""We need a commander-in-chief who will speak the truth and who will unleash the full force and fury of the American military to utterly destroy ISIS and its affiliates.""Americans rattled by deadly terrorist attacks, Trump advisers say, will see in his policies a course-correction that Mrs. Clinton is unwilling to take. ""People are concerned about the fact that this will happen everywhere. The question is not theoretical -- it's blood-covered,"" said Walid Phares, a Trump foreign-policy adviser.Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri suggested Mr. Trump is trying to capitalize on the strategy.While Mrs. Clinton ""has a comprehensive plan to combat ISIS at home and abroad,"" she said, ""Donald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes and self-congratulations. Trump has offered no real plans to keep our nation safe and no outreach to the Americans targeted, just insults and attacks.""---Alan Cullison contributed to this articleCredit: By Peter Nicholas",8/26/16
Election 2016: Stop-Trump Efforts Face Hurdles --- Convention delegate from Colorado tries to change rules so others could be considered,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1795819192?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has been the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for more than a month, yet his inability to unify party leaders and his widely condemned assertions about a federal judge's Mexican ethnicity are fueling efforts to dislodge him at the GOP's July convention.The two functioning stop-Trump groups remain small and have no funding behind them. One is composed of a handful of Washington-based operatives, attorneys and media personalities. The other is a coalition of about 15 convention delegates from Colorado who are trying to gather support for a rule that would unbind delegates who are now mandated by various state-party rules to back Mr. Trump for the nomination.Yet time, distance and disorganization are likely to render them ineffective, as the rest of the Republican Party, some with equal trepidation about Mr. Trump, steadily move toward the nomination of the New York businessman.Mr. Trump mocked his detractors at a Friday rally in Richmond, Va. ""I hear these poor, sad people, 'Never Trump,' they're still going, 'Never Trump, never Trump.' These poor guys,"" he said. ""They've been doing this for months.""Officials in the Washington-based group said last week they didn't know about their Colorado counterparts. The leader of the Colorado group said she would like to be in touch with conservative radio hosts like Hugh Hewitt and Erick Erickson leading the Washington stop-Trump effort but doesn't know how.The one person with enough backing among convention delegates to possibly block Mr. Trump's nomination -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz -- wants nothing to do with any of the efforts, aides say. And the family of TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, the largest financial backer of efforts to block Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries, is finished trying to stop his nomination.""Because he is the presumptive GOP nominee, Marlene and Joe Ricketts have stopped funding efforts opposing Trump,"" said Brian Baker, the family's political adviser.The most organized effort to stop Mr. Trump is being led by Kendal Unruh, a high-school government teacher from Castle Rock, Colo., who has been volunteering for conservative causes since she was a county chairwoman for Pat Robertson's 1988 presidential campaign.Mrs. Unruh, a member of the convention's Rules Committee, on Thursday began circulating to committee members from other states a ""declaration of conscience"" that calls for allowing delegates bound to Mr. Trump to become free agents, which would force a contested convention. Her biggest obstacle: There is no public list of convention delegates or committee members.So Mrs. Unruh and her team are scouring the internet and calling state parties. She said she aims to get 56 out of 112 Rules Committee members to sign her declaration. So far her team has tracked down the names of about 30 members.""I'm hoping to lock it down in 10 days. It's got to happen,"" Mrs. Unruh said. ""I've managed and consulted on dozens of campaigns. I know how this has to be done. It's just like getting out a vote or passing legislation.""At the same time in Washington, the group of Republican operatives and lawyers sought out Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker -- in part because of his close relationship to the Ricketts family -- about seeking the nomination at the convention should delegates become unbound.Mr. Walker, who had long pledged to back Mr. Trump if he won the nomination, told a Wisconsin TV station Tuesday that Mr. Trump is ""not yet the nominee,"" a comment widely interpreted in stop-Trump circles as a signal he would be open to a white-knight candidacy at the convention. An aide said Mr. Walker never spoke with the stop-Trump group and issued a statement from his boss saying he is ""focused on being governor"" and that if he runs for anything it would be re-election in 2018.Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski called the groups seeking to unbind delegates ""fringe elements"" that don't have widespread traction.The biggest impediment to the remaining stop-Trump efforts is the lack of cooperation from Mr. Cruz. The GOP's 2016 presidential runner-up hasn't said anything publicly about efforts to dislodge Mr. Trump -- whom he has yet to endorse -- but his team worked to elect about 750 Cruz loyalists as convention delegates.The Cruz bloc in Cleveland is large enough that, combined with other delegates who have concerns about Mr. Trump, it could force through a rule change to unbind delegates, though Mr. Cruz's closest aides have shown no interest in doing so.Abetting a stop-Trump move would carry enormous political risks. Mr. Cruz's bloc of loyalists wouldn't be large enough for him to win a contested convention. If his team pushed through rule changes to block Mr. Trump, the Texan risks getting the blame for a political Armageddon and then watching someone else become the party's standard-bearer and instant front-runner for the 2020 campaign if Republicans lose the White House this November.Credit: By Reid J.

"Trump, Under Fire, Rallies Supporters",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794079396?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, facing mounting criticism from allies as well as adversaries over his attacks on a federal judge's ethnicity, on Monday tried to get his supporters to stick with him in the fight.On a day when a wave of Republican officials continued to turn against him on the issue, Mr. Trump held a conference call with supporters to fend off criticism for saying that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel has a conflict overseeing cases against the Trump University real-estate program because of his Mexican heritage and Mr. Trump's stated goal of building a wall on the southern border.Critics, including leaders of Mr. Trump's own party, have said his comments are offensive and follow a dangerous line of reasoning that could undermine the independence of the federal judiciary. Republican elected officials and strategists also worry the showdown will drive away Hispanic voters who will be critical in the party's efforts to win the White House and hold its majority in the Senate.At issue is a pair of cases Judge Curiel is presiding over in which the plaintiffs alleged Trump University duped them into paying tens of thousands of dollars in the belief they would be trained to learn Mr. Trump's real-estate strategies.Mr. Trump denies the allegations, saying the students got their money's worth, with many offering positive evaluations of the program.Among the latest allies to turn against Mr. Trump on the issue was Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, a Republican facing a tough re-election fight, who said of Mr. Trump Monday, ""His comments are wrong and offensive and I've asked him to retract them.""Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been mentioned as a potential running mate, on Monday expanded on his earlier critique.""We don't judge you as part of a group. That would be to suggest that blacks can't get a fair white judge, whites can't get a fair black judge,"" Mr. Gingrich said on ""The John Gibson Show."" ""Once you go down that road, you destroy America.""During a Fox News interview Monday night, Mr. Trump didn't repeat his attacks on Judge Curiel but did argue that labeling the Indiana-born jurist as ""Mexican"" won't hurt his standing with voters.""I don't care if the judge is Mexican or not,"" Mr. Trump told host Bill O'Reilly, who had just argued for Judge Curiel to recuse himself from the Trump University litigation. ""I'm going to do great with the Mexican people because I'll provide jobs.""Mr. Trump added that he is ""being treated very, very unfairly"" by Judge Curiel, who is precluded from responding by the code of conduct for federal judges.With the controversy intensifying, supporters were told in a memo from a Trump campaign aide over the weekend to hold off from discussing the issue.On Monday's conference call, Mr. Trump sent a different message and the campaign tried to arm supporters with facts to be able to shift the focus to Judge Curiel's legal decisions and connections to Democrats.Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said on CNN that the initial message had been to ""hold off, let's not talk about that until we have the facts, which is what happened on the conference call.""""For surrogates that didn't have the facts, of course the campaign is going to say, don't talk about it,"" she said.The call, which lasted less than an hour, included a number of public figures who have been speaking out for Mr. Trump in the media, including Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and former Sen. Scott Brown, said one official on the call, which was first reported by Bloomberg News.Such message-discipline calls are common during national political campaigns. What's unusual for Mr. Trump is that he has taken it on himself to be his campaign's chief messenger.Ms. Pierson shrugged off criticism from GOP allies, saying they spoke because ""the media pressure was intense.""""This is typical reaction from Republican leaders,"" she said. ""At the first hint of controversy or criticism regarding race, they tuck their tails and run and want to condemn immediately without even trying to understand what's happening here.""Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), one of the strongest Trump supporters on Capitol Hill, said he wasn't on the call, but that he knew how passionately Mr. Trump feels about defending Trump University. ""He feels like the lawsuit is not justified, and he's been outspoken to that effect,"" Mr. Sessions said.But other Republican officials joined the chorus of those critical of Mr. Trump's reference to the ethnicity of the judge.The judge has issued pre-trial rulings against Mr. Trump and has unsealed documents in the Trump University litigation offering a detailed look at the business's operations and scathing assessments from some former workers.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, Mr. Trump said Judge Curiel had ""an absolute conflict"" in presiding over the litigation, given that he was ""of Mexican heritage"" and a member of a Latino lawyers' association.Mr. Trump said the background of the judge, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants, was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern U.S. border. ""I'm building a wall. It's an inherent conflict of interest,"" Mr. Trump said.The New York businessman also alleged the judge was a former colleague and friend of one of the Trump University plaintiffs' lawyers. The judge and the lawyer once worked together as federal prosecutors, but the lawyer, Jason Forge, in an interview said he had never seen the judge socially.---Reid J.

"Why Trump, the 'King of Debt,' Hates Dodd-Frank",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794079339?accountid=12768,"Populism -- standing up for the little guy against the powers that be -- seems to be the theme of the 2016 presidential campaign. Yet Donald Trump, a faux populist if there ever was one, said in a May 17 interview that he wants to eviscerate the Dodd-Frank Act. In his words, ""it will be close to a dismantling of Dodd-Frank."" But destroying Dodd-Frank certainly would not be good for the little guy.Dodd-Frank was the landmark legislation enacted in 2010 to, among other things, ensure that we never have a repeat of the financial catastrophe of 2008 -- nor of the disgraceful practices that led up to it. Lest The Donald forget, those misdeeds led to the worst recession since the 1930s, to massive layoffs, to millions of foreclosures, and perhaps worst of all, to the political disaffection that gave rise to Trumpism.So why would an alleged populist turn on Dodd-Frank? I can think of three reasons. One is the Republican article of faith that all regulation of business is bad, period. Maybe. But Mr. Trump has been repudiating Republican orthodoxy, not to mention Republicans, left and right.A second explanation is that Mr. Trump is cozying up to the big bankers from whom he now needs campaign contributions -- contrary to his repeated promises to fund his own campaign. Well, maybe. Many bankers would certainly like to get out from under Dodd-Frank. But many others, being rational, probably prefer the known Dodd-Frank to the unpredictable Donald Trump.Third, and most likely given his cascade of ill-thought-out positions, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about. So let's review some of the safeguards that would disappear if Dodd-Frank were dismantled.First, and perhaps foremost to many Americans, is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a bete noire of the GOP since it was first suggested in 2007 by now-Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). Yes, the CFPB is a bit of a pain to the financial industry -- yet another regulator. But Congress created it for a good reason: to protect millions of unwary consumers from the sleazy practices that decimated so many families' finances and led the country into economic calamity. Should we go back to the status quo ante?Next, and probably foremost to policy wonks, Dodd-Frank abolished ""too big to fail."" Yes, abolished it. For reasons I will never understand, the Obama Treasury has not trumpeted this achievement far and wide. So many Americans think that too big to fail lives on. It doesn't. Here's what Dodd-Frank actually says.The Treasury's 2009 proposal sought to give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. two options for dealing with a sick financial giant: liquidation (to wit, slow death) or resolution (to wit, keeping it alive on life support). But Congress, in no mood to authorize future bank bailouts, rejected the second option. Thus Title II of Dodd-Frank created only ""Orderly Liquidation Authority,"" not resolution authority. Yes, some banks may still be too big, but not too big to fail.To underscore the no-bailouts point, Congress included this declarative sentence in Title II: ""Taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of any authority under this title."" That's no losses, as in zero. Further, to give this clause teeth Congress specified that any public funds not recovered by selling the failing bank's assets ""shall be the responsibility of the financial sector, through assessments."" Critics of Dodd-Frank may keep repeating falsehoods, but this no-bailout language is emphatic and unambiguous. Why would a defender of the little guy want to undo it?Dodd-Frank's third, and very important, objective was to make it much harder for big banks to play with fire, and thereby occasionally burn down the neighborhood. This it accomplished in two principal ways: by toughening supervision, which was embarrassingly weak before the crisis, and by reducing leverage.The Donald, who calls himself the ""king of debt,"" of course loves leverage. After all, in Trumpworld you can walk away from your debts, stick your creditors with losses, and make your balance sheet great again. I also understand why a tycoon with Mr. Trump's business record would not want government regulators snooping around. But why would any hardworking Americans want to follow him off the deregulatory cliff?There is lots more in Dodd-Frank, including much-needed regulation of derivatives -- something Congress had, amazingly, banned in 2000. But I think I've listed enough to make the point. The Dodd-Frank Act is not perfect. But it provides significant protections for the average Joe and Jane, makes our financial system safer, and abolishes too big to fail. A candidate who really wanted to stand up for the little guy would not promise to dismantle Dodd-Frank. He would pledge to defend it.---Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is an informal policy adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Dodd-Frank Hasn't Eliminated TBTF Banks"" -- WSJ June 15, 2016)Credit: By Alan S.

Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Why Trump's Latest Controversy Will Linger,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794079333?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has ignited controversies large and small in his run for the presidency, and he's managed to cruise past most of them not only alive but also enhanced in many cases.Yet the one in which he is embroiled now, over his repeated attacks on an American judge of Mexican descent who is hearing a case against the now-defunct Trump University, isn't going away so easily. It has lingered and actually seemed to grow over the weekend. The question is: Why this one?Most significantly, it has caused fellow Republicans who recently rallied to Mr. Trump's side to speak out, in some cases forcefully. The two leading Republicans in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is mentioned regularly as a potential Trump running mate, all have been openly critical. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a former GOP presidential primary foe, spoke up on Monday as well.To be sure, it's not at all clear that this ruckus will do any more lasting damage than have earlier uproars, which often have only improved Mr. Trump's standing with his backers. ""I guess based on history -- an odd history -- I'm not prepared yet to say how much this will hurt him,"" said Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush aide who backs Mr. Trump but also is critical of him over this episode. ""Everything obvious that you would say would hurt him before hasn't.""Yet this controversy feels a bit different. Republican leaders, including those supporting Mr. Trump, suggest four specific reasons that is so.First, the attacks on the federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, moved from Mr. Trump's tried-and-true line of attack on the nation's immigration practices to the question of ethnicity. That is different territory.""First of all, this judge was born in Indiana,"" Mr. Gingrich said on Fox News. ""He is an American, period. When you come to America, you get to become an American. And Trump who has grandparents who came to the U.S. should understand this as much as anybody.""Second, the attack represented an attempt to intimidate a figure in one branch of the government, the judiciary, just as Mr. Trump secured his claim to the nomination to run another branch of the government, the executive branch. That has raised questions of how he would treat the constitutionally enshrined separation of powers.""If justice is blind so should all Americans be who are concerned about justice,"" said Mr. Fleischer. ""This unwinds all that."" He added that ""there isn't a lot that makes the judiciary powerful except our acceptance of it.""Third, this controversy is about Mr. Trump's personal position, in a legal matter of his own, rather than the welfare of Americans more broadly.That makes this controversy ""fundamentally different,"" said Eric Cantor, the former Republican leader in the House. ""This is Trump talking his book. He's attempting to influence the outcome of a lawsuit he is defending by using his political muscle. It's all about Trump. Where is the benefit conferred upon the electorate?""By contrast, Mr. Trump's attacks on holes in the nation's immigration system and flaws in its trade agreements have been equally blunt, but they are connected to the broad economic damage many Americans feel they have incurred from illegal workers or unfair competition from foreign countries. Even his controversial proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country was directly related to broad fears about the danger of terrorist infiltration. This controversy has no equally obvious broad significance.And fourth, the timing of this episode has made Republicans cringe. It arose just as many of them had swallowed their misgivings and begun lining up behind Mr. Trump -- and as the candidate himself, as presumptive Republican nominee rather than merely presidential contender, was being seen in a different light by a broader national audience.Many Republicans thought there was at least an implicit understanding embedded in their decisions to swing behind Mr. Trump: They would move past their past concerns about his candidacy, and in return he would begin to change his style, becoming less incendiary and -- to use the term Mr. Trump himself deploys frequently -- more presidential.Moreover, Republican pollster David Winston notes that the controversy overshadowed bad data on job creation that could have been the focus of discussion over the weekend, to Democrats' detriment: ""The story at the end of the week was the poor jobs report, the worst monthly report since 2010, and instead the electorate is hearing about Trump's view of a judge who is handling a case he is involved in.""This controversy is being prolonged by another factor: Mr. Trump's decision not to walk away from the dust-up, as he has at times in the past, but rather to double down on it, thereby bestowing a bit of fame on the previously obscure Judge Curiel.Credit: By Gerald F.

"Business News: BuzzFeed Cancels GOP Ad Deal --- Digital-media outlet cites tone, substance of Trump campaign as reason for move",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1794079243?accountid=12768,"BuzzFeed has canceled an advertising deal with the Republican National Committee because of the tone and substance of presumptive nominee Donald Trump's campaign, BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti said on Monday.In a memo to the staff of the digital-media company, Mr. Peretti said Mr. Trump's campaign ""is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and, in some cases -- such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims -- would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs.""The BuzzFeed deal, signed in April, when Mr. Trump appeared poised to lock up the Republican presidential nomination, accounted for less than $1.5 million in ad spending, said an RNC official, but no money had changed hands.A BuzzFeed spokeswoman declined to comment on the deal's financial terms.""Space was reserved on many platforms, but we never intended to use BuzzFeed,"" said Sean Spicer, the RNC's chief strategist and communications director. The agreement with BuzzFeed represented a fraction of the about $150 million in advertising across ""dozens"" of platforms that the RNC has reserved to ensure it paid the lowest rates, the official said.A representative for Mr. Trump declined to comment beyond the RNC's response.Mr. Peretti said that while the company doesn't like to turn away revenue, ""In some cases we must make business exceptions: we don't run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we won't accept Trump ads for the exact same reason.""""Trump advocates banning Muslims from traveling to the United States, he's threatened to limit the free press, and made offensive statements toward women, immigrants, descendants of immigrants, and foreign nationals,"" Mr. Peretti wrote. He said the agreement had been for ads slated to run during the fall election cycle.Politico reported earlier on the deal's termination.Marketers work with BuzzFeed to fashion ""sponsored content,"" which can be articles or videos that look and feel like regular editorial work. This form of advertising has gained popularity in online publishing in recent years, and companies ranging from the New York Times to CNN to The Wall Street Journal have units that work to make sponsored content for brands.Recent BuzzFeed ads include ""14 Borderline Erotic Photos For Anyone Who Loves A Clean Home,"" sponsored by Clorox Co., and the quiz, ""What Percentage Of Your Mind Is On Snacks?"" sponsored by SkinnyPop popcorn.Mr. Peretti described the move to end the ad deal as a business decision that wouldn't influence political coverage. ""This was Jonah's call, and the prerogative of a publisher,"" Ben Smith, BuzzFeed editor in chief, said in an emailed statement.While the so-called equal-time doctrine requires broadcast stations that have a candidate on the air to offer the same opportunity to a rival, such rules don't apply to newspapers or websites, said Rick Edmonds, a media-business analyst at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank.""It's quite common for newspapers and websites to turn down ads if they don't think they are appropriate, and that could include things like guns and escort services, and it could also include hate speech,"" Mr. Edmonds said. ""What seems to make this case unusual is it typically would not include a leading campaign, but I guess you could argue this isn't the typical party or typical candidate.""The digital publisher has clashed with Mr. Trump before, and BuzzFeed reporters on the campaign trail have been barred from attending his campaign events. In 2014, after the site ran a critical profile of the businessman's presidential ambitions, Mr. Trump tweeted that BuzzFeed had ""zero credibility"" and was ""totally irrelevant and sad!""BuzzFeed's Mr. Smith wrote in an internal memo last year that, while reporters and editors should generally avoid making political statements, calling Mr. Trump a ""mendacious racist"" is ""entirely fair.""Digital-media outlets are vying for an influx of political ad dollars. Candidates and outside interest groups are expected to spend about $1.1 billion on digital advertising this cycle, up from $162 million in 2012, according to an estimate from Borrell Associates.While tech giants such as Google and Facebook stand to benefit most, digital outlets like BuzzFeed specialize in the kind of custom content that appeals to the youthful audience sought by political candidates and brand advertisers.Indeed, BuzzFeed's editorial unit, which is separate from the ad side, has created entertaining videos featuring presidential candidates this cycle.

Trump Draws Ire Of Ryan and Obama,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796411839?accountid=12768,"President Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan, the nation's leading Democratic and Republican elected officials, rebuked presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump over his response to this weekend's Orlando massacre, rejecting his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S.Mr. Trump also came under more fire from expected Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, who said his policies would make America less safe.The swift, bipartisan criticism illustrates the steep challenges ahead for the political newcomer as he enters the general-election phase of the presidential race.Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton moving further ahead of Mr. Trump, even though she has yet to hold a series of events to try to unify the Democratic Party at the close of her extended primary battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. She leads Mr. Trump by more than four points in the average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics.""Are we going to start treating all Muslim-Americans differently?"" Mr. Obama said. ""Are we going to start discriminating against them, because of their faith?"" The president added that isn't the America he wants.Mr. Trump remained defiant. ""President Obama claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people,"" Mr. Trump said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. ""When I am president, it will always be America first.""Later Tuesday at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., Mr. Trump said, ""He was more angry at me than he was at the shooter . . . . That's the kind of anger he should have for the shooter.""The rhetorical exchanges came after Mr. Trump also raised questions about Mr. Obama's response to the extremist threat, saying that Mr. Obama ""doesn't get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands.""Mrs. Clinton called her likely Republican rival's comments ""shameful"" and ""disrespectful.""""Even in a time of divided politics, this is way beyond anything that should be said by someone running for president,"" the former secretary of state told supporters in Pittsburgh. ""I have to ask: Will responsible Republican leaders stand up to their presumptive nominee, or will they stand by his accusation about our president?"" she said.The president never uttered Mr. Trump's name in his remarks, while Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her likely rival simply as ""Donald.""For his part, Mr. Ryan called for an alliance with moderate Muslims to combat Islamic terrorists -- instead of the sweeping ban Mr. Trump has advocated. Mr. Ryan said the U.S. should tighten its screening process of refugees entering the country, rather than impose a religious test.""I do not think a Muslim ban is in our country's interest. I do not think it is reflective of our principles -- not just as a party, but as a country,"" Mr. Ryan said.Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican running in a tight re-election race, also said Mr. Trump's comments after Orlando were ""offensive.""Brian Reisinger, spokesman for Mr. Johnson's Senate re-election campaign, said his boss finds Mr. Trump's comments about the Orlando attack to be ""wrong,"" adding that ""we need to focus on areas of agreement that unite us in a strong commitment to destroy ISIS and battle Islamic terrorism. Ron hopes the president and people from both parties will agree on this objective,"" he said.Clinton campaign officials have said that the Orlando killings, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, and Mr. Trump's response to it, underscore how important national security will be in the presidential election, and bolster their contention that the New York businessman is temperamentally unfit for the job of commander in chief.Mr. Trump blamed Sunday's shooting on the president and his former secretary of state, saying that they restrained intelligence gathering and presided over a dysfunctional immigration system that brought Islamic terrorists to the U.S. The presumptive Republican nominee also denounced Mrs. Clinton's infrequent use of the term ""radical Islam.""""She has no clue, in my opinion, what radical Islam is, and she won't speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""She's in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world -- true weakness.""On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump was fixated on the terminology. She asked, ""Is Donald Trump suggesting that there are magic words that, once uttered, will stop terrorists from coming after us?""Mr. Obama raised the same point, suggesting that using the ""radical Islam"" label more frequently wouldn't lessen Islamic State militants' commitment to killing Americans.""Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away,"" he said. ""This is a political distraction.""Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton also repeated their calls for tougher restrictions on guns Tuesday, saying that the U.S. needs to make it harder for people who want to kill to obtain ""weapons of war.""Omar S. Mateen, the the New York-born son of Afghan immigrants whom police have identified as the Orlando shooter, legally bought a rifle and a handgun in recent days, according to authorities.""Let's get this straight: We have reached the point where people can't board planes with full bottles of shampoo,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""But people being watched by the FBI for suspected terrorist links can buy a gun with no questions asked. That is absurd.""Mr. Trump said Monday that Mrs. Clinton wants to take away Americans' guns and that he wants to ensure people have the means to protect themselves in the age of terror.---Byron Tau, Kristina Peterson and Janet Hook contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",8/29/16
Politics & Ideas: Where Clinton and Trump Agree on Terror,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796399320?accountid=12768,"Monday's dueling speeches in response to the Orlando massacre offered a preview of the general election. Hillary Clinton attacked the problem without mentioning Donald Trump; Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton and, for good measure, Barack Obama, whom he addressed in terms too vile to be believed if uttered by anyone else. Conspiracy theory, the cesspool of conservative populism, is Mr. Trump's native habitat.The presumptive presidential nominees disagree fundamentally about the origins of the threat we face. Mrs. Clinton believes that the current wave of violent extremism represents a perversion of Islam. The overwhelming majority of Muslims here and abroad, she insists, are ""peaceful people"" who reject this ideology. That is why it would be wrong to ""declare war on an entire religion.""Mr. Trump believes that what he calls radical Islamic terrorism is an intensification of Islam rather than a distortion of it. In harmony with 68% of Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center in a December 2015 survey, he thinks that Islam is more likely than other faiths to encourage violence among its adherents.This conceptual divide spills over into practice. Mr. Trump demands that Muslim communities in America cooperate with law enforcement ""to turn in the people who they know are bad."" This should pose no difficulty, he adds, because Muslims ""know what's going on,"" including the real intentions of the perpetrators of the horrors in Orlando and San Bernardino. Along with President Obama and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan, Mrs. Clinton believes that most homegrown terrorists keep to themselves, their inclinations known only to a few friends or no one at all. If so, insisting that Muslim communities know about the dangerous people in their midst will only diminish their willingness to cooperate with law enforcement.There are other policy differences between the candidates. Mrs. Clinton believes that it should be more difficult to buy the assault weapons that have figured so prominently in recent episodes of mass carnage; Mr. Trump responds with an appeal to the Second Amendment, broadly construed. Mr. Trump wants a temporary ban on immigration from areas of the world with a history of terrorism against the U.S., a proposal Mrs. Clinton regards as self-defeating as well as a violation of core American principles. And Mr. Trump thinks that the words we use to characterize our adversaries matter a lot, while Mrs. Clinton wants us to focus on what we do to them: What matters is that we killed Osama bin Laden, not what we called him as we did the deed.Still, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump agree on two important points.The first is a shift in the kind of threat America faces. The U.S. response to 9/11 was designed to minimize the chance that acts of this sort -- attacks from abroad -- would happen again. We adopted new laws and procedures to meet new threats.These antiterrorism efforts proved remarkably successful and have enjoyed a substantial measure of support across party lines. There have been fierce controversies about detention policies, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and using lethal force against American citizens abroad. But the policies have been sustainable because respected leaders in both parties agreed that they should continue.Now, though, the candidates agree that we must pivot to meet a new threat, not from abroad, but from within. Homegrown terrorism is hard to anticipate, let alone prevent. All too often, the difference between spikes of anger and murderous intent is detectable only in retrospect. And American citizens are entitled to the full range of legal and constitutional protections, which rule out some tactics that might be effective.This brings us to the second area of agreement between the candidates -- the need to reconfigure and intensify intelligence efforts in response to threats that are increasingly homegrown. Mrs. Clinton recommends an ""intelligence surge"" backed by the tools and resources needed to identify domestic extremists before they act. Mr. Trump says that we need an intelligence-gathering system that is ""second to none,"" with enhanced cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement at all levels of the federal system.I have a suggestion that would, if accepted, drive down cable-news ratings: When the dust settles, refocus the discussion on these areas where the candidates and parties broadly agree. If the new threat is homegrown terrorism, how should laws, policies and practices be reconfigured to meet it? If the centerpiece of the response is improved domestic intelligence, what would this mean operationally?The location of the line between measures that are aggressive but acceptable and those that breach legal or constitutional limits will be a matter of continuing controversy, but this is where the real work will be done once we stop yelling at each other -- if we ever do.Credit: By William A.

Main Street: Trump Plays the Radical Islam Card,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1796116252?accountid=12768,"""I have never made but one prayer to God, a very short one: 'O Lord, make my enemies ridiculous.' And God granted it.""The author is Voltaire but it could be Donald Trump. Because in this election year, the people who most object to Mr. Trump appear to be doing the most to boost his popularity. Their latest contribution comes as America is still reeling from the ISIS-inspired massacre at an Orlando nightclub.On Sunday morning, the nation awoke to the news that nearly 50 innocent people had been murdered by a gunman at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Soon they would learn the shooter was 29-year-old Omar Mateen, born in America to parents of Afghan origin.In other words, a heavily-armed man with Afghan parents and a Muslim name had targeted a gay nightclub for his bloody rampage. And yet as the American people watched those Sunday press conferences on their TV sets, they were treated to a parade of officials, including the obligatory imam, all reluctant to connect the killer with anything suggesting Islam.At 1:59 p.m. it was the president's turn.Though he did call the slaughter at Pulse an ""act of terror,"" anyone relying on Barack Obama for a read of the situation would have had no idea that the killings at a Florida nightclub might have been inspired by the same ideology behind the forces still confronting American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.Now ask yourself: Does this undermine the Trump message or fuel it?On Monday, after a security briefing, President Obama conceded the shooter was ""inspired by various extremist information"" online. His sole reference to what this might be was a line about the ""perversions of Islam that you see generated on the internet.""Characteristically Monday found Mr. Trump repeating his call for a temporary ban on Muslims. Let's stipulate this call is all his critics say it is: overly broad and not well thought out, given, for example, that to defeat the Islamists making war on America we will need the full assistance both of Muslim nations and individual Muslims, not least Muslim Americans.But Mr. Trump's comments are not received in a vacuum. They come in the context of an Obama administration and a Hillary Clinton campaign that, 15 years after al Qaeda hijackers flew civilian airliners into buildings in New York and Washington, still have trouble acknowledging radical Islam as a motivating force.At a Democratic presidential debate in November, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether her failure to use the phrase ""radical Islam"" was a sign she had a weak policy. Back then she ducked, but post-Orlando Mr. Trump has successfully forced the issue. So on Monday Mrs. Clinton answered by declaring she is ""happy to say"" either ""radical jihadism or ""radical Islamism.""But she added an inadvertently telling point: Those pushing the language about radical Islam, she suggested, are trying to ""demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.""Mr. Trump, of course, has found himself quite frequently on the demonized end of the stick. Only a month or so ago, he was commonly likened to Hitler. So it was no surprise that on Sunday, even as the bodies of the dead in Orlando were still being removed, the New Yorker posted a David Remnick story with this headline: ""Donald Trump's Exploitation of Orlando.""Notwithstanding Mr. Remnick's claim that it ""feels indecent on such a day to engage these comments of Trump's at all,"" the tone suggests it felt pretty good. The particular indecency in question was a Trump tweet saying the mass murder in Orlando had proven him right about the Islamist threat to Americans.Funny how no one finds it indecent when Mr. Obama uses a shooting to justify his call for gun control. And where was Mr. Remnick when Mrs. Clinton tweeted that ""Bernie Sanders prioritized gun manufacturers' rights over the parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook""?Leave aside that the term ""radical Islam"" itself marks a distinction between violent jihadists and peaceful Muslims. The greater irony here is that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton may not be as far apart as may appear on ISIS. Both emphasize an air war: While Mr. Trump says he would bomb ISIS oil fields, Mrs. Clinton embraces the Obama fiction that we can do the job with a few Special Forces and a good bombing campaign. Neither addresses the hard truth that defeating ISIS will require a much greater U.S. commitment, probably including more ground troops.Even so, at least for now, Mr. Trump benefits. His language on Muslims and the Middle East may be crude and unnuanced. But it's not hard to understand its popular appeal when set against a president and his secretary of state who almost always invoke Islam only when it's time to lecture their fellow citizens about anti-Muslim bigotry.Mr. Trump often complains about how unfairly he's treated by his critics. If he understood what folks such as Mr. Remnick are doing for him, he'd put them on the payroll.Credit: By William McGurn",8/29/16
"Election 2016: Campaigns Target Economy --- Clinton to swipe at Trump's business record, while he readies his response",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797844263?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton will target Donald Trump's business record on Tuesday, casting the presumptive Republican nominee as self-interested and deceptive as he prepares to provide more details about his economic proposals during the coming weeks.Tuesday's address in Columbus, Ohio, will build on Mrs. Clinton's recent foreign-policy speech in which she used a compilation of Mr. Trump's own words to suggest that he is uninformed and even dangerous.""It really comes down to being able to show that every time Trump had an opportunity to get something for himself at the expense of someone else, he took it, in spades,"" said Jake Sullivan, the Clinton campaign's policy chief.Mr. Trump, for his part, plans to unveil new details about a regulatory overhaul, spending cuts and modifications to his tax plan designed to reduce projected deficits and provide additional growth incentives, according to a person close to the campaign.Mr. Trump is also poised to punch back at his rival's characterization of him, saying in an interview that he is a ""great businessman"" and that Mrs. Clinton is a ""total disaster.""""I own some of the greatest properties. I even took bad deals and turned them into good deals, so my business record is phenomenal,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I've employed thousands of people, and now her business record -- she has no clue.""The coming Clinton speech is an attempt to strike at the heart of a campaign of a candidate with no political experience but a decadeslong history in the business world. While Mr. Trump has argued he would be a champion for the working class, Mrs. Clinton will counter that his career has been focused on enriching himself, often at a cost to others, advisers said.Mrs. Clinton plans to highlight some of Mr. Trump's more controversial economic policy statements, including his calls for imposing tariffs on China and Mexico, a move that could risk dual trade wars, and his suggestion that the U.S. might try to renegotiate the national debt, an idea he later rescinded, aides said.She also will point to specific ventures, including Trump University, which is now at the center of lawsuits accusing the business of fleecing students.Mrs. Clinton's economic argument against her likely general-election rival is one of three pillars of her campaign's Trump attack, aides said. Foreign policy and the theme of unity versus division are the other areas of focus.In a recent interview, Mrs. Clinton said she would draw attention to Mr. Trump's ""deeply misguided"" policy proposals and what her campaign describes as an out-for-himself approach to business. But she and her aides said she also must make the case for her own agenda.""All of my plans are focused on a single, overarching goal,"" she said in the interview. ""Creating good paying jobs with rising incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time. And I believe so strongly that Americans deserve and need a raise, and every one of my policies adds up to an agenda to make that happen.""Mrs. Clinton has struggled to win support from white, working-class voters, while Mr. Trump has found success with that demographic.Many surveys have shown voters think Mr. Trump would do a better job on economic issues, and a recent CBS News poll found that the presumptive nominees were running even on the question of who would do a better job handling the economy and jobs.Mr. Trump said in the interview that Mrs. Clinton wouldn't bring jobs back and suggested she was unqualified to handle the economy because her husband, Bill Clinton, as president signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump called ""one of the worst bills in history.""Mrs. Clinton has rolled out a long list of policy proposals, including infrastructure investment, capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, increasing federal investment in child care, providing paid family leave and making college more affordable.---Nick Timiraos contributed to this article.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson and Laura Meckler",8/30/16
"CFO Network (A Special Report) --- A Very Unusual Election: Two pollsters offer their insights into how Donald Trump beat his primary opponents, and what his chances are in November",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797843750?accountid=12768,"For insight into one of the most unusual presidential campaigns in recent history, Gerald Seib, Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, spoke with Bill McInturff, co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies, and Frederick Yang, senior vice president of Hart Research Associates. The two are pollsters for, respectively, the Republican and Democratic parties, and conduct The Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls. Edited excerpts of the interview follow.MR. SEIB: This is not a climate or a race like any we've ever seen. How is it different, and why is it different?MR. YANG: We've seen for a quarter of a century, there's this hunger for change, for a different way. Anti-Washington. That segment of the public has found the voice for that dissatisfaction.MR. MCINTURFF: We have had polling since the 1930s, and we've never had two candidates who've had negatives this high. We have a majority of people saying, ""I'm voting because I want to vote against the other person."" That has never happened.We had $25 million spent in February attacking Rubio, and none on Trump. Each Republican candidate said, ""OK, it'll be Trump and somebody. The other somebody will win, so I'll leave Trump alone and try to be the somebody else by demolishing the next guy in line."" Donald Trump sort of floated through the Republican primary, and still only has 41% of the votes cast. When it was competitive, he was in the mid-30s. But the Republicans have a winner-take-all system in enough states where mid-30s, high 30s, you become the nominee. So, this happened because of long-term powerful trends that are, if anything, escalating. But the rules contributed to a pretty unusual result.MR. SEIB: Why does the country's conservative-liberal polarization work for Mr. Trump, who's more a populist than a conservative?MR. MCINTURFF: In December, we asked a poll question, ""What are you looking for in a president?"" Republican primary voters said, ""What I want is somebody who will kind of blow up the system in Washington, who will be a strong leader."" His style is so potent that it blew past what we think about as being typical ideology.Exit-poll numbers tell you a lot. We had a majority of Republican primary voters saying they've been betrayed by their national party. Republican primary voters' perceptions were that there was too much compromise with the Obama administration. They saw Donald Trump as somebody who would be aggressively at the barricades for a point of view; you could count on him to be an unrelenting fighter for that point of view.MR. YANG: For Trump, it wasn't ideological, it was style. It didn't matter what he was saying, just that he was loud and strong and emphatic. That is what a chunk of the electorate, certainly Republicans, are looking for even if it seems to go against the party orthodoxy.MR. SEIB: In your party [the Democrats], Fred, people who would have said, ""Let's have a $9 minimum wage,"" decided, well, maybe because they couldn't get that, they would go for the guy who wants $15, and who wants to break up the banks. Where did that come from?MR. YANG: In the December poll, we asked what's the biggest concern in the economy. And by about 57% to 37%, it was lack of economic opportunity for working families, versus inequality on Wall Street. That stems from a very real debate we're having on the economy and economic security. We asked in May, about the Great Recession, ""Are you and your family still feeling the effects?"" Two years ago, the percentage of Americans feeling the effect was around 64%, 65%. This May it was 64%, 65%. And Trump voters were more likely to feel the impact than Democrats.MR. MCINTURFF: White men who have less than a college degree are voting for Trump by almost 40 points. White men with a college degree are Trump by about seven. White women that don't have a college degree, Trump by 11. But white women with a college degree are voting against Trump by double digits. It's a group that Romney carried narrowly, and he's losing by double digits.MR. SEIB: Is that the Achilles' heel for Mr. Trump? Suburban white women? College-educated white women?MR. YANG: The Achilles' heel is the political arithmetic. One of my favorite pollster stats is Mitt Romney defeated Barack Obama by the same proportion among whites that George Bush defeated Michael Dukakis by in 1988. Bush won the popular vote by eight points. Romney lost the popular vote by four points. The college-educated white woman is a symptom of the broader point.It's really hard for a Republican to win white voters by more than what Romney and Bush won white voters by, 20 points: 59%/39%. The voting-age population in 2016 will be 31% minority. It's hard for me to see how the math works for Trump if he doesn't win whites by 30 points, which would be really hard, or make inroads into that minority population.MR. MCINTURFF: African-Americans are roughly, let's say, 10% of the population. Obama carried them by 90 points. The quote ""traditional"" Republican usually loses them by 80. That's a one-point difference [in the general vote]. So, you get a point back just by being a traditional Republican. I think Donald Trump will do a little better with African-Americans, because he's not really a traditional Republican.So I think there's a point there he could get back. And we don't know if Secretary Clinton's campaign is going to have the same impact that Obama did with African-American turnout and Latino and young, 18- to 29-year-old.Trump outperforms Romney with white voters. You can make that argument; he will actually outperform Romney among white men with less than college education. Change the turnout with those people -- very hard -- then figure out how you would get back some chunk of college-educated women to break even.He could conceivably pick somebody for vice president that the country perceives to be fill-in for what his lack of experience has been, in a way they find reassuring. There are downscale white voters who've not been voting. And he is powerfully speaking to a set of emotions and issues that may in fact have some capacity to mobilize those voters.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Gerald Seib",8/30/16
"Election 2016: On Gays, Guns, Trump Takes Risk --- Overtures to LGBT voters and calls to discuss firearm limits unnerve key GOP allies",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797031505?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's overtures to the gay community and policy proposals on gun control in recent days have unnerved and confused some would-be allies and put the presumptive Republican presidential nominee at risk of alienating core GOP constituencies.Since Sunday's mass shooting at a gay nightclub by a man claiming allegiance to terror groups, Mr. Trump has pronounced himself an advocate for gays and said on Twitter that he plans to meet with the National Rifle Association to discuss ""not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns."" Democratic lawmakers and candidates are pushing legislation since the shooting aimed at restricting suspected terrorists' access to weapons.While Trump advisers have long said his nontraditional candidacy is appealing beyond typical GOP voters, Mr. Trump risks tamping down support from base voters and grass-roots activists who have long powered Republican presidential campaigns. In 2012, 78% of white evangelicals backed Mitt Romney, compared with just 21% for President Barack Obama. The latest NBC News poll showed Mr. Trump with support from 55% of white evangelicals.""These are the people who will phone bank for you for hours for no pay,"" said Penny Nance, the CEO of Concerned Women of America, an anti-abortion rights group. ""He not only has to win their votes, he also has to win their hearts.""On Wednesday, Mr. Trump surprised top officials at the NRA with his tweet calling for a meeting to talk about banning people on terror watch lists from buying guns. NRA Executive Director Chris Cox had just met with Mr. Trump the day before in New York, and the issue of the terror watch list wasn't raised.Mr. Cox in a statement said he is ""happy to meet with Donald Trump"" and reiterated the NRA's support for legislation backed by Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) that provides ""due process provisions"" when someone on a terrorist watch list tries to purchase a firearm. Gun-control advocates have called Mr. Cornyn's proposal inadequate.Asked if Mr. Trump was referring to Mr. Cornyn's proposal, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks replied by email, ""see tweet."" She declined to elaborate on the details of his positions.Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist who maintains deep roots in gun-rights politics, said Mr. Trump is ""playing with fire with the gun people"" by floating any new gun restrictions.""If it's not based on principles and understanding and it's just based on politics, you go where the wind blows,"" Mr. Feldman said. ""He's losing the edge with gun owners. I don't think gun owners have a lot of other places to go, but they're not going to be enthusiastic.""Mr. Trump's willingness to stray from some typical GOP positions fit with his declarations that he doesn't listen to the party's power brokers, said Whit Ayres, a GOP polling expert. But he also is demanding the skittish party to unite behind his candidacy, Mr. Ayres said.""He may very well be counting on support from non-NRA members and non-traditional Republicans in light of the Orlando tragedy,"" Mr. Ayres said. ""Time will tell whether that's a smart bet or not.""Mr. Trump on Wednesday acknowledged he may not win support from all Republican leaders. ""This is too tough to do it alone, but you know what? I think I'm going to be forced to,"" Mr. Trump said in Atlanta. ""Our leaders have to get a lot tougher,"" he said of GOP congressional leadership.Mr. Trump faces skepticism among social conservatives for some of his comments during the primary suggesting he is open to gay and transgender rights. In recent days, he has trumpeted his affection for the gay community, and Wednesday in Atlanta he cited his decision to allow gay couples to become members of his Mar-a-Lago club as a reason that gay voters should back him.Mrs. Nance said her organization's 400 local chapters contacted more than 2 million voters to help Mitt Romney late in the 2012 campaign.But this year, Mrs. Nance, who is among a group of social conservative leaders planning to meet with Mr. Trump Tuesday, doesn't have any plans to help him and said she has had little interest from her donors.""I have to be convinced that it's the right thing to do and that I'm not working to put our credibility on the line and running my volunteers to death to accomplish all this and later be disappointed,"" Mrs. Nance said.Credit: By Reid J.

Trump Can't Win From a TV Studio,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797030235?accountid=12768,"In this most unusual of elections, conventional wisdom has often been wrong. Donald Trump is betting the presidency that the trend will continue.For starters, Mr. Trump believes that fundraising and TV advertising are overrated. ""I just don't think I need nearly as much money as other people,"" he told Bloomberg. ""I get so many invitations to be on television."" But consider a hypothetical: Say Hillary Clinton runs a week of TV spots in Tampa/St. Petersburg, a key media market in Florida, and Mr. Trump counters by appearing on cable shows.Counting only adults, 314,000 viewers might see a Clinton ad during ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, according to Nielsen data. Nearly 190,000 would see one during ""Dancing With the Stars"" on Monday; 248,000 during ""NCIS"" on Tuesday; and 120,000 during ""Hawaii Five-0"" on Friday.Mr. Trump's appearances on Fox News would reach only a fraction of those numbers: 82,000 adults for a segment on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" and 61,000 for one on ""The Kelly File."" An appearance on CNN's best-viewed evening program would reach 33,000.Granted, people who watch cable news are more politically active and likely to vote. Still, it's unclear whether Mr. Trump can counter an advertising onslaught with free news coverage alone.Mrs. Clinton's ads, which will start in earnest within days, may prove more effective at changing minds. They will present targeted messages from varying surrogates -- perhaps a hard-hitting factual ad on Mr. Trump's bankruptcies during ""60 Minutes,"" followed by a soft-focus pitch for Mrs. Clinton by a single mom during ""Dancing With the Stars."" Mr. Trump's interview appearances, on the other hand, tend to look alike, and his message could be muted by the host's questions.The aerial assault by Mrs. Clinton's Super PAC might be partially responsible for Mr. Trump's recent decline in the polls. He would be better off doing both free media appearances and ads. The rub, now that the self-proclaimed multibillionaire has abandoned his pledge to self-fund his campaign, might be money.The website Open Secrets says that the Clinton campaign (through April 30) and supporting PACs (through May 15) have raised $289 million, while the Democratic National Committee has taken in $102 million through May 31. That's a total of $391 million.For the same periods, Open Secrets reports that Donald Trump's campaign and supportive groups have raised $61 million (mostly from Mr. Trump), while the Republican National Committee has collected $150 million. That totals only $211 million.Democrats aim to raise $1 billion, or $600 million more than they have so far. Republicans admit privately that they will be lucky to raise another $300 million. The bottom line is that Mrs. Clinton may outspend Mr. Trump two to one -- which strikes many GOP leaders as dangerous.Mr. Trump's attitude about the ground game is equally unconventional. Team Trump thought it largely unimportant and therefore ceded it to the Republican National Committee in the joint fundraising agreement signed last month. This is an unusual move but not necessarily a bad one.RNC Chairman Reince Priebus had been planning for this task for years, having decided after Mitt Romney's defeat that the national party's efforts were best spent registering new Republicans, identifying supporters, persuading swing voters and turning them out. This is a throwback to at least the 1960s, when the RNC, not the presidential campaign, led the door-to-door canvass.Mr. Priebus placed directors in battleground states almost three years ago. They now lead a staff of 473 -- compared with 170 at this point in 2012 -- in executing the ground game. They have already trained 3,500 volunteer field organizers.Yet this might not be enough. Hillary Clinton is trying to duplicate President Obama's enormous 2012 get-out-the-vote machine. Fox News reported last month that she has already opened offices in 28 states and boasts nearly 800 staff directing an estimated 10,000 volunteers.When the RNC invites Trump supporters to training sessions, they show up, energized and passionate. But will Team Trump funnel thousands more volunteers to the RNC? And will the party raise the necessary funds to execute its ambitious plan? Neither is clear.Mr. Trump's decisions -- to forgo ads, abandon his self-funding pledge and accept a big financial deficit, and turn the ground game over to the RNC -- are unprecedented challenges to conventional wisdom. In 21 weeks, we will know if they were smart bets. Call me old-fashioned, but I'm wagering that the first two are not.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",8/30/16
Election 2016: Wide Gap in War Chests --- Trump campaign had $1.3 million at the end of May compared with $42 million for his rival,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798194962?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump raised $3.1 million in the month after he became the GOP's presumptive nominee, giving him a staggering cash disadvantage heading into the general election against Hillary Clinton.After largely self-financing the primary election, Mr. Trump said last month that he would begin actively soliciting money for the general election. He appointed a national finance chairman and finalized a joint fundraising vehicle with the Republican National Committee. But his paltry haul that month suggests his campaign was unable to turn his clinching of the party's nomination into a fundraising boost.Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, raised $27 million last month even as she sought to fend off the final weeks of primary rival Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. She has raised $240 million over the course of the cycle, to Mr. Trump's $17 million. (He also has lent himself $45.7 million through May.)Mr. Trump's May haul, which he supplemented with $2.2 million in loans, left him with $1.3 million in the bank. Mrs. Clinton's campaign had 32 times as much in its war chest: $42 million.Mr. Trump's cash deficit means it will be extraordinarily difficult for him to rival Mrs. Clinton's expansive operation, both in TV ads and grass-roots efforts.He has said he would rely heavily on the RNC, but the party's efforts in battleground states are small in comparison to the Democrats and nonexistent in several blue states, such as California, that Mr. Trump says he wants to put on the map.In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney raised $23.4 million in May, the month after he clinched the nomination, and had $17 million in the bank.Mrs. Clinton's super PAC also far outpaced Mr. Trump's network of outside groups last month. The Clinton group, Priorities USA Action, raised $12.1 million in May, an uptick from the previous month, and has $51 million in the bank.Great America PAC, one of the super PACs backing Mr. Trump, raised $1.4 million in May and had about $500,000 on hand at the end of the month. Mr. Trump has at least two other groups backing him, too.To be sure, Mr. Trump got a late start to fundraising, and he has ramped up efforts, attending a slew of fundraisers in Texas last month that he estimated raised about $13 million. He is set to attend a high-dollar fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday, and he has said he may not need to meet the $1 billion fundraising goal of Mrs. Clinton's campaign.Yet, several members on a list of prominent Republican fundraisers who Mr. Trump and the RNC announced last month had signed on to work for their joint fundraising committee said they haven't raised any money for the effort.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",8/31/16
Trump Ousts His Campaign Manager,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798194847?accountid=12768,"Republican Donald Trump fired his campaign manager on Monday, saying he wanted to shift his team's focus heading into the fall election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.Corey Lewandowski was forced out after Mr. Trump's older children and some of his senior advisers blamed the campaign manager for failing to adjust strategy and persuade the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to strike a more positive tone for the general election, according to people familiar with the situation.Mr. Trump's older children -- Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, as well as Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner -- had been alarmed in recent weeks as Mr. Trump's poll numbers tumbled after his attacks on a Hispanic judge overseeing litigation against Trump University and his decision to double down on his proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S. following the Orlando, Fla., shooting, according to the people.In a meeting on the 25th floor of the Trump Tower, where the adult children work as executives in their father's organization, the family laid out their worries that the general-election campaign still hadn't come together under Mr. Lewandowski, and that he continued to advise their father as if he were running in the primaries, according to a person familiar with the situation.Since May 26, Mr. Trump's standing in the Real Clear Politics poll average has moved from essentially a tie to a six-point disadvantage in his match-up with Mrs. Clinton.Ultimately, Mr. Trump agreed he needed to part ways with Mr. Lewandowski, who had clashed with Paul Manafort, an old-guard Republican operative who gained influence after he was hired to prepare for the convention and general election.Speaking in his Trump Tower office after the private meeting, Mr. Trump showed the strain of having forced out the man who had emerged as one of his closest advisers. ""I liked Corey very much,"" he said. ""I've been very loyal to Corey.""""It's never easy,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I wish Corey the best.""Still, Mr. Trump said it was time to take the campaign in a different direction. ""We wanted to make a change for the next big phase of this campaign,"" Mr. Trump said.On Tuesday, he is meeting with evangelical leaders, a key GOP constituency that is just getting to know Mr. Trump at the same time he is casting himself as a champion of the gay community after the massacre at the Orlando nightclub.Mr. Trump also is reaching out to members of Congress and donors who are worried about the back-to-back controversies that have hit his poll numbers.In an interview on Monday with CNN, Mr. Lewandowski expressed no regrets about the campaign he helped run, and repeatedly deflected questions about the exact reasons for his dismissal, saying only ""things change"" as the campaign transitions from a successful primary fight to a much more expensive general-election showdown with Mrs. Clinton.""It's been a great privilege,"" Mr. Lewandowski told CNN, in a wide-ranging interview in which he defended himself and Mr. Trump. ""I wouldn't change a thing.""The fired campaign manager acknowledged in the interview that he was escorted from Trump Tower after his dismissal, but he said he had ""a nice conversation"" with Mr. Trump. He was complimentary of the candidate's family, in response to questions about the role Mr. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband played in his ouster, calling Ivanka Trump ""a great asset.""Mr. Trump's recent controversies seemed to stem from the kind of freewheeling, off-the-cuff speaking style that helped him win the primary election, the ""Let Trump be Trump"" approach Mr. Lewandowski favored.The staff shake-up is expected to enhance the power and influence of Mr. Manafort. He had locked horns with Mr. Lewandowski over the direction of the campaign as Mr. Manafort sought to impose more discipline on the presumptive nominee, encouraging him to speak from prepared text and use a teleprompter.Mr. Lewandowski's ouster was welcomed by Trump supporters and donors as a signal that the candidate understood their concerns.""I think this is going to be well received as an indication to all his supporters that we are going to be more focused going forward,"" said Rep. Chris Collins (R., N.Y.), one of Mr. Trump's most vocal supporters on Capitol Hill.But it remains to be seen whether Mr. Manafort will right the campaign ship, or whether Mr. Trump himself -- with his penchant for controversial rhetoric -- is the source of his campaign's turbulence.""Sometimes, he is his own worst enemy,"" said Armstrong Williams, business manager and senior adviser to former presidential candidate Ben Carson, who is now a Trump backer. ""If Trump continues to say what he's saying, it doesn't matter. Somebody needs to tell Trump it's not necessarily your [campaign] operation. It's not Corey. It's not Paul. It's you.""Mr. Lewandowski was one of the first people hired to Mr. Trump's campaign staff, back before the New York businessman announced his candidacy, and when few political professionals and Republican presidential rivals took his prospects seriously.The campaign manager himself became a focus of the volatile campaign in March, after former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields accused him of battery for grabbing her after a Trump news conference in Florida. He was briefly charged, before authorities eventually dropped the case.The change comes at a time of growing concern among Mr. Trump's supporters about his controversial statements. Some backers say his remarks aren't only preventing them from building new support for Mr. Trump, but driving existing supporters away. One example was when Sen. Mark Kirk (R., Ill.) rescinded his endorsement after Mr. Trump made comments about the Mexican heritage of the judge in the Trump University case and questioned the jurist's integrity.There had been rumbling of a campaign shake-up since late last week, but the news on Monday caught even some close Trump confidantes and campaign aides by surprise. Donors had been grumbling for weeks that the campaign needed a better response to Clinton campaign attacks on Mr. Trump's fitness for office, according to people familiar with those complaints.""There was no question that people in the fundraising world were delivering the same message I did from congressional supporters,"" said Mr. Collins, one of many congressional Trump backers who met with Mr. Manafort last Thursday.Credit: By Janet Hook, Monica Langley and Patrick O'Connor",8/31/16
Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: How a Trump Victory Could Happen,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798194821?accountid=12768,"A few weeks ago, after Donald Trump locked down the Republican presidential nomination, a series of polls showed him roughly even with or a bit ahead of Hillary Clinton, and Democrats went into a slight panic.Last week, after Mrs. Clinton had locked down the Democratic nomination, a series of polls showed Mr. Trump falling well behind Mrs. Clinton, in two cases by 12 percentage points, and Republicans went into full-scale panic. Perhaps in response, Mr. Trump on Monday parted ways with his longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.So this is a good time to take a deep breath and remember a few basics. Some of the recent poll movement is the inevitable result of the two candidates consolidating their own parties. Some is the result of Mr. Trump's unartful handling of the Orlando terror attack and his fight with a federal judge.Meanwhile, here are the basic facts: The four-plus months remaining before the election is a long time. Mrs. Clinton starts the general-election season clearly in front. But Mr. Trump could win. Is that the most likely outcome? Probably not. Is it possible in this unconventional year? Absolutely.The simple political math tells you there are three things Mr. Trump would need to do to make that happen:First, he has to start performing better among white, college-educated women. These voters are the Trump Achilles' heel.Polling suggests he is winning among white men who have less than a college degree by more than some 40 percentage points. He's winning among white women who don't have a college degree by 10 points or so.But among white women with a college degree, he is losing by almost double digits. That's a group Republican Mitt Romney won four years ago. To carry key suburban areas in swing states such as Pennsylvania and Colorado, Mr. Trump would have to improve among them.Second, he has to hope third parties suck away some of the Clinton vote.One of the most striking aspects of this campaign is the high level of animosity toward both major candidates, which leaves more voters than normal open to considering somebody else.And there are two somebodies else out there: former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson running on the Libertarian Party ticket, and Jill Stein, presumptive Green Party nominee. Early polling suggests it's possible they could steal more votes from Mrs. Clinton, perhaps among disgruntled supporters of Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. In some states, a few percentage points could be enough to tip the balance.Third, he has to put together the right set of states.This is the tricky part. Any Republican nominee faces an electoral college map that tilts in favor of the Democrats, given current demographic and voting trends in key states. Of course, the unconventional Mr. Trump has the potential to produce an unconventional map -- which could be either a good thing or a bad thing for him.A reasonable starting point for doing Electoral College math is the 2012 election, in which President Barack Obama beat Mr. Romney by 332 to 206 electoral votes, giving him well more than the 270 needed to win.The states Mr. Obama won represent a pretty good picture of the Democratic base, with some key swing states such as Colorado, Iowa and Virginia thrown in. Mr. Trump would have to replicate the Romney performance and then add a series of states.Mr. Trump has talked of winning heavily Democratic New York and California and turning New Jersey his way. The first two represent a fantasy, and the third an extremely tall order.A better question is how he could win without such a miracle. There are two basic paths by which he could do this: The Florida path, in which he wins the giant Sunshine State and its 29 electoral votes, and the non-Florida path.The Florida path is much easier. If Mr. Trump wins that state, then tacks on, for example, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Maine -- all possibilities -- he would get to 267 electoral votes, just three short of what he needs. He'd then have to win just one other state from a list of possibilities: Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, or, yes, New Jersey.The non-Florida path is a lot tougher. If Mr. Trump loses Florida but wins Iowa, Maine and New Hampshire as well as both rust-belt giants Ohio and Pennsylvania, he would reach only 258 votes. He then would have to tip Virginia, New Jersey or Michigan, or some combination of two other swing states, to get over the top. And he'd have to keep Democrats from swinging their way the previously Republican states of Arizona, Georgia and Utah, all seemingly in play.A tough assignment, yes -- but not impossible in a year in which the improbable already has happened.Credit: By Gerald F.

Trump's Pro-Growth Path to Victory,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798194590?accountid=12768,"Can Donald Trump make America grow again? His record-breaking number of GOP primary voters -- more than 13 million -- seem to think so. And Americans overall strongly prefer Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton on the economy, and on employment and jobs, according to Gallup's latest polling.But according to the orthodoxy of the economically sophisticated on both the left and the right, Mr. Trump's signature agenda -- his hostility to global trade, especially with China and Mexico -- is antigrowth know-nothing protectionism. More trade is axiomatically better than less, say the sophisticates, and Mr. Trump is tempting the angry masses into a suicidal trade war.Yet consider the potentially axiom-breaking speed and magnitude of the rise of U.S. trade with China after China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. By 2015, compared with 2000, American trade with China (adjusted for inflation) almost tripled to a $577 billion annual rate, and now represents 3.2% of U.S. gross domestic product.The advantages of such trade are well known, and need no recounting here. But as Mr. Trump's fellow reality-TV star Dr. Phil might ask: ""How's that been working for you?"" Not so well, actually.Since 2000 -- the last year before the great expansion of U.S. trade with China began -- real per capita U.S. annual GDP growth has fallen, on average, to less than 1%. In the five years before 2000, growth averaged more than 3%. We can't blame the Great Recession for this dismal ""new normal"" -- it began right after 2000 when trade with China took off, not in 2008 when Lehman Brothers failed.The year 2000 was also the peak for the U.S. labor market. Labor-force participation hit an all-time high then, with 67% of adult Americans either working or in the market for a job, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By year-end 2015, labor-force participation had fallen to 62.6%, the lowest in two generations. So today's seemingly low unemployment rate is nearly meaningless, because so many Americans have given up even trying to get a job. We can't blame demographics -- the ""graying"" of America isn't at fault when labor-force participation has fallen sharply among Americans still in their prime working years.But can we blame trade with China? Mr. Trump and his masses do. And now new research by MIT's David Autor and colleagues might begin to move elite opinion in the same direction. In a series of landmark papers, Mr. Autor has shown that the adjustment by U.S. workers to the post-2000 China trade shock has been far slower than predictions by the standard models used by labor and trade economists, and that new jobs in new industries have not materialized as expected. He also demonstrates that regions most affected by trade with China have contributed to today's political polarization by sending far-right conservatives and far-left liberals to Congress.Mr. Trump's solution? If he carries out his threat to build a massive tariff wall against Chinese exports, it is Americans who would pay for it, with another shock to our economy. But Mr. Trump has been clear that the purpose of such threats is to ""bring China to the bargaining table."" Mr. Trump is right that America could get a more artful deal with China for granting access to the massive U.S. consumer and business market. We should insist that China open its markets to us symmetrically, and protect U.S. intellectual property. Even the staunchest advocates of trade ought to support that.But the core of Mr. Trump's growth agenda isn't just about China, or Mexico, or any other trade partner. It's about America -- making us more competitive and dynamic in an increasingly globalized world, and more able to profitably adapt to trade shocks.For example, the U.S. 35% corporate-tax rate is the highest in the developed world. Since taxes are simply a cost of doing business, our high tax rate means U.S. companies face higher costs than foreign competitors. Mr. Trump has proposed to abolish this competitive disadvantage by slashing the top U.S. business tax rate to 15%.Mr. Trump's sharply lower business-tax rate would be an immediate boost to after-tax earnings, and thus a boost to equity values. It would remove the barrier that prevents U.S. firms from repatriating foreign profits and putting them to work at home. It will give firms an incentive to expand, and enable new ones to be born -- both of which will drive more jobs. With Mr. Trump's proposal to sharply lower personal tax rates, workers will also have a big incentive to return to the labor force, and will be able to spend or invest more of what they earn.For the presumptive GOP nominee a key target for deregulation is the U.S. energy industry. Oil prices have fallen over the past two years thanks to the U.S. shale revolution, but they are still well above historical norms, with frackers held back by what Mr. Trump calls ""massive new bureaucratic barriers."" Hillary Clinton vows to add new regulations until there won't ""be many places in America where fracking will continue."" Mr. Trump, it seems, remembers that the oil crisis of the 1970s was solved by the deregulation of the 1980s.Call Mr. Trump a know-nothing if you must. But after 16 years in the new U.S. millennium of malaise, voters are responding to his diagnosis that something has gone unexpectedly wrong with trade, and his proposals to make America more dynamic in order to adapt. Don't forget the last know-nothing who came along and showed America how to pull out of a malaise, with an agenda quite similar to Mr. Trump's, to cut taxes and slash regulations on businesses and energy. His name was Ronald Reagan.---Mr. Luskin is chief investment officer at Trend Macrolytics LLC.Credit: By Donald L. Luskin",8/31/16
Election 2016: Trump to Meet Religious Right,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798194568?accountid=12768,"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump's effort to simultaneously court religious conservatives and the gay community will be tested Tuesday when he meets privately with hundreds of faith leaders in New York.At the meeting, Mr. Trump is likely to be drawn into the debate over religious liberty, which pits same-sex marriage opponents seeking legal protections for their views against same-sex couples seeking services from government and businesses.Kelly Shackelford, president of a Texas-based law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases, said he has been encouraged by Mr. Trump's list of potential Supreme Court picks, all conservatives, but needs more details on the New Yorker's stance on faith issues.""Someone new to many of us, like Donald Trump, needs to show they have thought about this issue and will come down on the side of religious liberty,"" Mr. Shackelford said. ""I see this as the beginning of a conversation.""Ken Blackwell, the former Ohio secretary of state and another organizer of Tuesday's meeting, said most of the hundreds of people who attend will vote for Mr. Trump. The question is whether they will volunteer for the campaign and try to mobilize other grass-roots supporters.""This meeting is about intensifying their support and moving beyond checking that box,"" he said. ""Mr. Trump is dependent on two entities -- the Republican National Committee and the grass roots -- and that's why he can't blow this meeting off or treat it lightly. These are the people who will make the difference between victory and defeat.""The meeting with faith leaders comes at a time of turmoil in the Trump campaign. His poll standing has slipped, and on Monday he fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.Mr. Trump's controversial remarks about temporarily banning Muslims' entry to the U.S. and about the integrity of a federal judge of Hispanic decent have eroded his support among elected GOP officials.Reflecting on the candidate's efforts to shore up grass-roots support among churchgoers, Mr. Trump is expected to announce a religious advisory board this week.In the week since 49 people were gunned down at a gay club in Orlando, Mr. Trump has been portraying himself as a champion of the gay community whose strict immigration policies would keep antigay Islamic extremists out of the U.S. The suspected killer was born in New York to Afghan immigrants.A prominent gay Republican, Chris Barron, is leading outreach to the community with, he said, the campaign's blessing.At the same time, Mr. Trump is trying to show solidarity with people of faith -- many of whom are outspoken opponents of same-sex marriage and antigay bias measures -- by participating in Tuesday's meeting.A campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, declined to clarify Mr. Trump's positions on religious liberty.Some evangelical conservatives said they approve of Mr. Trump's remarks about protecting gay people from physical harm, as long as he maintains his long-held opposition to same-sex marriage.Credit: By Beth Reinhard",8/31/16
The Trump Disorganization,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798194453?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump seems to be trying to pack as many self-created crises as he can into the 20 weeks until Election Day, and a new installment arrived Monday as he suddenly fired his campaign manager. Campaigns ultimately reflect the candidate and his leadership, or lack thereof, and the shake-up will only make a difference if Mr. Trump recognizes how badly he is harming his own prospects.Perhaps the termination of Corey Lewandowski, heretofore Mr. Trump's most loyal aide who was present at the campaign's creation, is his concession that his operation is dysfunctional. He allowed competing power centers to emerge, with Mr. Lewandowski anchoring one camp and the veteran Beltway operative Paul Manafort the other.Their divisions over strategy and filling key positions have left Mr. Trump far behind Hillary Clinton on campaign basics like organization, staff, fundraising, digital voter outreach, policy development and much else.Every campaign has its dark nights of the soul, though few make them such a recurring feature. Mr. Trump appears to be convinced he can win the general election the same way he won the GOP primaries -- namely, out of his hip pocket. The last month-and-a-half jump since Mr. Trump secured the nomination should disabuse him of the notion that the White House can be won with only a mass rally a day, free cable media and a lively Twitter feed.Instead of driving a disciplined message about the economy, national security and Clinton corruption, Mr. Trump has caromed on his own day-to-day instincts from the federal judge hearing the Trump University trial to his own alleged prescience about the attack in Orlando. He's neglected to campaign in the battleground states he needs to flip to win, and he told NBC News over the weekend that the race won't begin until after the Republican convention. That is not how politics works.As recently as late May Mr. Trump was tied with Mrs. Clinton nationally in the Real Clear Politics polling average, but he's since slid to a six-point deficit. A Washington Post-ABC survey last week found that 70% of Americans have an unfavorable view of Mr. Trump, up 10 points from May. The same figure for Mrs. Clinton is merely 55%. There's a reason Mr. Trump doesn't talk about his poll numbers any more.The danger is that Mr. Trump's negative public image is becoming fixed in the public mind even before Democrats drop hundreds of millions of dollars in negative television ads. The Clinton machine and her Super Pac have reserved about $30 million in air time in swing states this month. Mr. Trump and company have reserved $0. He hasn't aired a single TV spot since he won the Indiana primary on May 3 -- and several GOP Senators running for re-election have more cash on hand than he does.Mr. Manafort reportedly has been trying to professionalize the campaign. But it isn't an optimistic signal that Mr. Trump fired Mr. Lewandowski only after a family intervention that included Mr. Trump's son, his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.Mr. Trump still has time to reverse his fortunes, even if the hour is late. If he wants to run a national campaign, he'll allow Mr. Manafort to fill out his shoestring apparatus and put together a coherent hierarchy with delegated responsibilities and clear lines of accountability.But the hard reality is that the problems with the Trump campaign aren't Mr. Lewandowski's fault. They are Donald J. Trump's. If he wants to avoid a historic loss like 1984 or 1972 that costs the GOP its House and Senate majorities, he'll take more instruction from political professionals.If he doesn't, don't be surprised if unbinding the GOP delegates to choose another nominee at the July convention starts to seem like an urgent and attractive option to a growing number of Republicans.",8/31/16
"Phoenix Approves City Identification Card for Undocumented Immigrants, Others; City council approves plan ahead of Donald Trump's Arizona appearance to deliver a speech on his immigration policy",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815559718?accountid=12768,"The Phoenix City Council voted Wednesday to issue identification cards to city residents regardless of their immigration status, a surprising move for a state that has long favored measures to crack down on illegal immigrants.Phoenix is the first city in Arizona to offer such an ID.The vote came just before Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was due later in the day to outline his immigration policy in the border state, where national anxieties over illegal immigration have often played out.The municipal ID card will enable individuals to access certain city programs and conduct daily business, according to the city manager's office, which had supported issuing the cards. The card will be available starting in February.The ordinance passed by a vote of five to four, the culmination of a two-year campaign by immigrant and civil-rights groups and a reflection of the city's growing Hispanic population and Democratic clout in the Republican state.New York, Los Angeles and Oakland are among cities that issue similar cards, including to undocumented immigrants. New Haven, Conn. was the first city to offer such an ID in 2007.Supporters say it will benefit immigrants, homeless individuals and others who often lack traditional identification necessary to conduct everyday business, such as open a bank account, sign a lease and enter a library or city building.""They are real people... whose lives we can make better"" with the card, Vice Mayor Kate Gallego said ahead of the vote.Opponents say it would promote identity theft and illegal immigration. Councilman Jim Waring said, ""I hope nothing bad comes of this."" He said the city would be ""willy nilly"" giving Phoenix IDs to foreign nationals.The card can't be used to acquire legal residence in the U.S., register to vote or access welfare benefits. It will be valid for a maximum of two years from the date of issuance and for as long as the cardholder maintains Phoenix residency.Each city department will accept the card as a valid identification and valid proof of Phoenix residency. The Phoenix Police Department may use other identification forms and processes as necessary to substantiate a person's identity.To obtain a card, a resident must complete an application and present proof of identity, such as a passport, and Phoenix residency with utility bills. A fee will be charged for the card, which will be issued and administered by SF Global LLC, a private company; it won't be funded by taxpayers.""We have found a way to do this in a cost-neutral fashion,"" said Councilman Daniel Valenzuela, adding that it would boost public safety.Despite the victory, the identification card's long-term survival isn't guaranteed. Last session, State Senator John Kavanagh sponsored legislation, which failed to pass by one vote, to bar cities from creating such a card.Write to Miriam Jordan at miriam.jordan@wsj.comCredit: By Miriam Jordan",9/1/16
"Election 2016: On the Trail, Trump's Brand Gets a Boost",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799139536?accountid=12768,"When Donald Trump delivered a campaign speech Wednesday in one of his luxury hotels, the Wi-Fi link provided to reporters opened with a splashy room reservation page that announced, ""If success hasn't spoiled you, we will. Trump SoHo [Registered] New York is the only AAA Five-Diamond hotel in the neighborhood.""It was latest example of how the New York billionaire has, with flourish, used his high profile on the presidential campaign trail to promote his vast business empire and his brand.From the stump, Mr. Trump has defended Trump University, a defunct real-estate school that is subject of a fraud lawsuit. Many events have been held at some of his high-end golf courses and hotels. At one press conference, he displayed steaks, wine and bottles of water that bear his name. Friday, Mr. Trump will appear in Scotland for the reopening of a luxury golf resort he owns.None of that is illegal, but some Trump critics think it is unseemly.""There is a carnival barker aspect to it,"" said Kevin Madden, who advised 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and who has said he wouldn't vote for Mr. Trump. ""It didn't seem appropriate to those of us who believe our candidates should be promoting issues not products. But, hey, he won.""Other Republicans say Mr. Trump's approach makes sense.""A major part of Trump's case to be qualified for the presidency rests on his business success,"" said Fred Malek, a veteran GOP fundraiser. ""Emphasizing and even promoting his business interests seem to me to be perfectly reasonable and not an ethical breach.""Mr. Trump isn't the first presidential candidate to hawk wares on the campaign trail. Newt Gingrich, a 2012 GOP candidate, promoted sales of his wife's children's book at some campaign stops, accompanied by a costumed Ellis the Elephant, the hero of the book. Michele Bachmann, another 2012 candidate, promoted her autobiography on her campaign website.But Mr. Trump has much more at stake than predecessors who sold little more than books. He has active, personally led businesses, unlike candidates such as Mr. Romney, who during his campaign put his investments into a blind trust.""Your candidacy is about getting elected, not about promoting your personal business interests,"" said Kenneth A. Gross, a former Federal Election Commission official who advises candidates on ethics rules. ""You don't want to mix politics and business.""Mr. Trump, in his speech Wednesday attacking the Democrats' presumptive nominee, said Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have mixed politics and business in an insidious way. Mr. Trump accused her of trading on her experience as secretary of state to secure lucrative speaking engagements and contributions to the Clinton Foundation.""Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense,"" he said.Clinton campaign spokesman Glen Caplin said Mr. Trump's accusations were ""lies and nutty conspiracy theories"" to distract from what he called his flawed economic proposals.The latest FEC report shows that of the $6.7 million spent by the Trump campaign in May, $1.1 million went to hotels and other firms he owns or to reimbursing his children for their campaign travel.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Mr. Trump might as well use the ""finest properties anywhere in the world"" for campaign events. She quoted the candidate as saying, ""Why would I use someone else's properties?""Mr. Trump has found countless opportunities to churn publicity for his businesses. He held a press conference in his luxury hotel under construction in Washington, D.C. Many of his press conferences have been at Mar-A-Lago, his lavish Palm Beach estate. Others have been held at his golf courses in New York and elsewhere.At a rally in Richmond, Va., in June, Mr. Trump bragged about his nearby winery and brought Kerry Woolard, general manager of the company, up to the stage to talk about the business.The Scotland visit will be his highest-profile business trip since declaring his candidacy. He is to attend a ceremony at the Turnberry resort, which he has redeveloped with a $288 million investment, and later plans to visit a golf property in Aberdeen.Credit: By Janet Hook",9/1/16
Trump No-Show Earns City's Ire In Bench Battle,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799139293?accountid=12768,"A continuing dispute over public space at Trump Tower took another turn Thursday when New York City officials fined Donald Trump $10,000 after his representatives failed to show up at a hearing to explain why a bench remained missing.The bench, where passersby could rest, was part of a deal between the real estate mogul and the city dating to the 1970s. Mr. Trump was granted a bonus to build a bigger building in exchange for creating a public space at Trump Tower at East 56th Street and Fifth Avenue.Michael Cohen, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Mr. Trump, said the city's finding of default and the fine came about ""due to a scheduling error"" by one of Mr. Trump's lawyers.""Upon receipt of the notice of default, a rehearing will be immediately sought where evidence of compliance will be demonstrated,"" he said.The city also now is looking into whether Mr. Trump has improperly used the public space for events related to his campaign for the presidency.The tiff over the public amenities at Trump Tower isn't unique to Mr. Trump's property. Advocates for what are known as privately owned public spaces say they are taking steps to make sure that other private owners live up to promises they made in exchange for zoning bonuses.In January, Mr. Trump's company at Trump Tower, Trump Tower Commercial LLC was ordered by a city hearing officer to remove two 40-foot-long Trump Store counters. One store sold campaign hats and paraphernalia and accepted campaign contributions.The counters were set up in a 6,626-square-foot, marble-lined passageway and atrium on the lobby and lower level.It also was ordered to restore the 22-foot-long bench that was specified in architectural drawings filed with the city when it approved a zoning bonus in 1979. That deal allowed Mr. Trump to add 210,873 square feet, or about 40% more space to the size of the 58-story building, according to zoning records.About half of the bonus space was generated by the public space and gardens, and half by Mr. Trump's commitment to add retail in the building.After the January ruling, Mr. Trump didn't immediately remove the two store counters. In March, after an inspection, the Department of Buildings issued a new violation. Eventually the store counters were removed, and a $4,000 fine was paid. But the Department of Buildings found that the bench hadn't been restored, as required, a city official said, setting the stage for Thursday's hearing.Back in 1984, complaints surfaced that Mr. Trump had put plantings on the marble bench so no one could sit there. In response, Mr. Trump wrote to city officials saying the bench had caused difficulty: ""Drug addicts, vagrants, etc. have come to the Atrium in large numbers to sit and in fact to sleep on the bench,"" he said.Marisa L. Senigo, a spokeswoman for the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, said that if Mr. Trump's representatives ask to reopen the case within 45 days, they could clear the default.""Our enforcement actions will continue until the owner upholds their agreement with the city,"" a spokesman for the buildings department saidAt the end of May, the city Department of Buildings and the Department of City Planning began an investigation into Mr. Trump's use of the lobby for campaign events that may have closed off the space to the public. Mr. Trump often appeared at events with the atrium's five-story waterfall as a backdrop.In response, the Trump Organization said there ""is no agreement in existence"" that limits Mr. Trump's use of the property ""for any purpose he deems appropriate.""In his May 2016 campaign financial disclosure form, Mr. Trump is listed as president of Trump Tower Commercial LLC, and valued his interest in it at more than $50 million.According to the city Planning Commission, under the original agreement Mr. Trump is permitted to close the public space up to four times a year for private events, but only with city approval.Since they began their inquiry, city officials said, Mr. Trump hadn't held major events in the lobby.In the mid-1980s, a city planning memo said that under the agreement with Mr. Trump, permission to close the space to the public was to be granted at Trump Tower only for ""extraordinary worthy causes"", but it noted the agreement to limit use of the space was ""incredibly not reduced to writing.""After closing the two Trump Stores in the lobby level, a smaller store was opened one flight down on a level that also has considerable public space. On the main level, where display cases still show Trump-branded merchandise, a small sign says: ""We invite you to visit our brand new Trump Store on the lower level.""Credit: By Josh Barbanel",9/1/16
"Election 2016: Far From D.C., Trump Gets a Warm Embrace",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1797653172?accountid=12768,"HOUSTON -- Donald Trump marked the first anniversary of his presidential candidacy with a swing through Texas for fundraising and rallies, even as his GOP support in Washington erodes at a time when the party should be rallying behind its presumptive nominee.In a two-day swing, Mr. Trump paired meetings with billionaires alongside raucous rallies in Dallas on Thursday and in Houston on Friday.Mr. Trump, like others in his party, is marveling at how far he has come since he launched his campaign June 16, 2015, when he was widely dismissed as a long-shot. ""This is the one-year anniversary,"" Mr. Trump said in Dallas, ""and hopefully we're going to make it a worthwhile year.""He went to Texas at a time when his provocative statements in the wake of the Orlando, Fla., massacre -- about banning Muslims from entering the U.S. and suggesting that President Barack Obama was sympathetic with America's enemies -- have heightened tensions with many GOP leaders. It came just after more than a week of headlines over his criticism of a federal judge overseeing lawsuits involving Trump University.In Houston, some Muslims had hoped to organize a vigil outside the Friday Trump rally, but plans fizzled as community leaders expressed fears that the event could spark a violent reaction.""A lot of elders in our community have been very, very concerned,"" said Mahir Sayeed, a 17-year-old high-school senior. ""They believe that nobody who is going to be at the rally will be there with an open mind, and us being there is only a provocation.""Even though Mr. Trump has had the GOP nomination sewn up for a month, his post-Orlando rhetoric has slowed, if not set back, the effort to rally the party behind him.House Speaker Paul Ryan, in an interview to be broadcast Sunday on NBC, said he wouldn't lean on fellow Republicans to rally around their party's nominee.""The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that's contrary to their conscience,"" said Mr. Ryan, who this past week repeated his criticism of Mr. Trump's Muslim ban but said he had no plan to rescind his endorsement of Mr. Trump.Another senior Republican, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, said this past week that he wouldn't endorse Mr. Trump. In another defection, Richard Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush, told Politico he would vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump treats criticism from Washington Republicans as a badge of honor. At his rally in Dallas, he suggested he would bring his anti-establishment preferences into the staging of the Republican National Convention in July, even thinking about having a ""winners night"" that features sports and entertainment figures rather than politicians.But even as Mr. Trump thinks outside the box in his rallies and public campaigning, he has turned to the heart of the establishment in his private fundraising in Texas. He flew to the state in the company of Reince Priebus, Republican National Committee chairman, who sent a message via Twitter that said,""Reports of discord are pure fiction.""In Dallas, the two attended an event for the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that pools donations between the RNC and various state parties.People at the Dallas event were encouraged to give anywhere from $500 for people under age 30 up to $250,000 for the most well-heeled backers. Mr. Priebus and former RNC finance chairman Ray Washburne hosted the event.Mr. Trump was also slated to attend fundraisers in Houston and San Antonio before his Friday night rally in The Woodlands, a Houston suburb.Credit: By Janet Hook and Dion Nissenbaum",9/1/16
Older Trump Children Flex Muscle Inside Campaign,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798618745?accountid=12768,"When Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's family gathered Sunday to celebrate Father's Day, three of his adult children brought more than cards. They pressed their father to dump one of his top aides as part of a reboot for the general election.On Monday, the candidate's son, Donald Trump Jr., personally carried out the firing of longtime campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, demonstrating the outsize influence wielded by Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump, who also are senior executives of the Trump real-estate operations.The move by the Trump siblings was met with relief by many nervous Republicans, who were seeking a significant change in the campaign. At the same time, the fact that the initiative fell to the children, who readily admit their experience is in business not politics, is being seen by some Republicans as a further sign that Mr. Trump hasn't brought in enough political professionals to handle the pressures and demands of a general-election effort that in many ways is still being run as a family enterprise.""In business and politics, we obviously influence our father's thought process, but he always makes up his own mind,"" said Donald Trump Jr. in an interview. ""Ivanka, Eric and I have the ability to be very candid with our father.""The trio complained to their father that Mr. Lewandowski was such a ""control freak"" that he couldn't adapt to a new arrangement in which other managers, such as campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, would have power over key functions such as adding new staff. In addition, they observed firsthand the manager's hot temper, often directed toward women, which incensed Ms. Trump.Mr. Lewandowski said in broadcast and cable interviews Monday he had no regrets on how he ran the campaign. He said he preferred a ""small and nimble"" operation, and had a ""great relationship"" with the Trump adult children.Typically, one, if not more of the adult children, have traveled on the campaign plane with their father, sitting with him at his conference table while Mr. Lewandowski and the few other traveling staff sat at another conference table.They work on the 25th floor, one floor below his office in Trump Tower, and pop up to chat with him on business or the campaign frequently. Campaign staffers, on the other hand, are on the fifth floor and occasionally must wait to get time with him.It isn't unusual for a candidate's children to be deeply enmeshed in a presidential campaign; Chelsea Clinton, daughter of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, also is heavily involved, as were Mitt Romney's sons when he ran as the 2012 Republican nominee. The difference in this case is that there are fewer layers of political professionals involved alongside.At the Father's Day gathering at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., those three, as well as Ms. Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, discussed the ""cumulative evidence"" of Mr. Lewandowski's missteps since the primary season ended, said a person familiar with the discussion. The siblings framed the conversation in business terms and reinforced a conclusion Mr. Trump had been moving toward since hiring Mr. Manafort months earlier. What's happening in your campaign is not how we run a business, one of them said.Others have begun to adapt to the influence the Trump siblings wield. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus began calling Mr. Trump's elder children or Mr. Kushner when he needed to get direct answers or access to the party's presumptive nominee. Mr. Priebus ""is in consistent contact with the children and Jared as much as he is with Mr. Trump,"" said Sean Spicer, the RNC communications director.Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, many of whom have met with Donald Trump Jr., check in with him on the latest developments. Also, former GOP candidates contact the adult children, rather than the campaign, because they are regarded as honest brokers with Mr. Trump. All three are scheduled to deliver major remarks at the RNC convention in Cleveland in July.The three adult Trump children, who had been working in the business for years, stepped in to run his real-estate empire while their father launched his campaign a year ago. But since then, they have gradually assumed greater responsibility for the campaign's workings.For at least the last two months, the three have attended weekly campaign meetings and offered pointed input, as well as holding their own gatherings about other decisions, attendees said. The sons, frequent guests on TV and radio shows, went hunting with Iowa politicians and hung out in New Hampshire coffee shops.Ms. Trump made a series of get-out-the-vote videos and, just a few days after the birth of her third child and Mr. Trump's loss in the Wisconsin primary, kicked off his New York primary campaign, which he won and followed with more victories. Eric Trump personally called every delegate in Pennsylvania, a key state to lock up the nomination.Mr. Kushner, a wealthy real-estate businessman himself, also has become a confidant to his father-in-law. He initially set up the campaign's digital operation and has since established the Washington office, a growing policy shop and the speechwriting team -- areas where other Republicans saw the campaign as sorely deficient.The three are children from the first of Mr. Trump's three marriages, to Ivana Trump. His daughter with ex-wife Marla Maples, Tiffany, 22, just graduated from college. Barron, his son with his current wife, Melania Trump, is 10 years old.Even as Mr. Trump has listened to his three adult children more on campaign matters, their forceful position on Mr. Lewandowski was the toughest to take. Following the firing, Mr. Trump showed some discomfort in the minutes immediately afterward. ""It's never easy,"" he said in an interview. ""But it's a decision I had to make.""Credit: By Monica Langley",9/2/16
Election 2016: Trump's Staffing and Ad Buys Lag --- Republican badly trails Democrat in typical metrics of a campaign; a big expense: T-shirts,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798613536?accountid=12768,"Traditional campaigns spend the months leading up to the general election pouring cash into battleground states, hiring staff and airing television ads. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump spent the largest share of his money last month on T-shirts.The businessman's single largest expense in May -- for about $900,000 -- was on campaign merchandise, a category that also includes hats, mugs and stickers. His second-largest expense, for about $840,000, was on air travel -- about 40% of which was paid to an airline Mr. Trump owns.Democrat Hillary Clinton devoted her May spending to salaries, travel and advertising, as she faced the final weeks of her primary against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Her largest expense, for $2.4 million, was on payroll.The contrast between the two candidates' spending illustrates the vastly different campaigns each has created. Mr. Trump, who largely self-financed his primary campaign, has forgone setting up a ground-game operation and a finance team, in favor of relying on free media. Mrs. Clinton has assembled a large campaign organization that raised more than $240 million through May. Mr. Trump has raised $14 million in that period, on top of $45 million he loaned to his campaign.Mr. Trump is entering the general election with the thinnest campaign in modern political history, leaving him nearly entirely reliant on Republican Party efforts, which currently fall short of the Democrats', and making it difficult for him to compete with the former secretary of state in the complex general-election environment.Some of Mr. Trump's top supportersvoiced concern about his cash deficit. Ed Rollins, a co-chairman for a super PAC backing Mr. Trump, said the campaign was in ""big trouble"" in an interview with Fox Business Network.""Being perfectly honest, I used to be chairman of a congressional committee, and if I had a House race today that basically came in with that kind of figure in June, I'd take them off the target list,"" he said. He said Mr. Trump's recent comments about a Hispanic federal judge and the shooting spree in Orlando, Fla., have ""put a spear through the heart of a lot of donors.""Mr. Trump has struggled in particular to widen his pool of donors willing to give the top amount. He drew about 140 donations of the maximum $2,700 last month. Mrs. Clinton collected that many maxed-out donations on a single day:May 17.The latest fundraising disclosures showed that in May, the Clinton campaign paid 684 staffers. Mr. Trump employed 66. Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as his campaign manager onMonday, was paid $20,000 a month. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook receives about $7,200 a month.Mrs. Clinton outspent Mr. Trump on payroll, travel and ads last month, while he spent more than her on consulting and direct mail, according to their Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Trump also directed an unusually high level -- nearly 20% -- of his expenditures toward businesses he owns or to reimbursing his children, who serve as campaign surrogates, for travel.Mr. Trump on Tuesday released a statement calling his campaign ""leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.""He defended his meager intake in May -- when he collected $3.1 million, to Mrs. Clinton's $28 million -- saying that June ""represents the first full month of fundraising activity for the campaign."" He has ramped up his activity in recent weeks, holding an event with Wall Street donors in New Yorkon Tuesdayevening.While Mr. Trump spent about half as much as Mrs. Clinton in May, he cut checks for $1 million more than he raised, including the $2.2 million he loaned his campaign last month, leaving his campaign with just $1.3 million in the bank.On Tuesday, he said that his cash-on-hand figure was irrelevant, saying that ""if need be,"" he could finance the campaign himself. But his loans have dwindled in recent months as he has looked to more actively solicit funds.A Wall Street Journal analysis found he would likely not have the ready cash to self-finance an entire general-election campaign.Mr. Trump has said that he will rely on the Republican National Committee's ground-game operation to bolster his efforts. The party, unlike his campaign, has an established voter-contact operation and a field organization in the nation's battleground states, but its efforts lag behind those of the Democrats.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",9/2/16
Election 2016: Trump Questions Clinton's Faith,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798613424?accountid=12768,"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump questioned Democrat Hillary Clinton's religious faith while affirming his own at a private gathering of hundreds of conservative evangelicals in New York on Tuesday.Mr. Trump's overture to the religious right came one day after he fired his campaign manager and reported raising tens of millions of dollars less than Mrs. Clinton, heightening concerns in the GOP political establishment about his readiness for the general election.The religious leaders are potential officers in a grass-roots Trump army in November. But when eight of the event's organizers were asked whether they would endorse him, none raised their hands, though they said he made progress in earning support.In a meeting earlier Tuesday with a few dozen people who arranged the event, Mr. Trump suggested Mrs. Clinton's religious faith was some sort of a mystery. The former secretary of state and New York senator is a Methodist.""We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion,"" Mr. Trump said, according to video posted on Twitter by one of the organizers, Christian minister E. W. Jackson. He confirmed the video's authenticity in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.""Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no -- there's nothing out there,"" Mr. Trump told the group. ""It's going to be an extension of Obama, but it's going to be worse, because with Obama you had your guard up; with Hillary, you don't, and it's going to be worse.""In the run-up to the 2012 election, Mr. Trump incorrectly suggested Mr. Obama was a Muslim and wasn't a U.S. citizen.In response to Mr. Trump's remarks, the Clinton campaign released a statement of support from evangelical leader Deborah Fikes. ""She lives the Golden Rule in her private life and in her public policies,"" she said. ""Hillary Clinton is the leader who people of faith are looking for, and we are praying that Sister Hillary and not Mr. Trump will be elected in November.""---Reid J.

"Clinton, Obama, Trump and the Abuse of Power",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798612528?accountid=12768,"The authors of a widely quoted study finding that political conservatism is correlated with an authoritarian personality have announced a correction. Turns out their article in the American Journal of Political Science reported their findings exactly backward. The academics now tell us that views on the left side of the political spectrum correlate with authoritarian traits. Political pundits should consider running similar corrections regarding Donald Trump.It has been this year's most popular media cliche: casting the likely Republican presidential nominee as an aspiring tyrant who will trash constitutional norms in his unending quest for power. Political seers from Georgetown to Manhattan claim to hear in Mr. Trump's words disturbing echoes of the 1930s. Columnists forecast a dark chapter of authoritarian rule in the U.S. should he be elected.But Mr. Trump isn't that bad. America isn't that fragile. And for anyone concerned about Washington tyranny, there are larger threats -- Hillary Clinton, for one -- that deserve attention.Mr. Trump has been under fire lately for the temporary ban on Muslim immigrants that he proposed last year. Last week he seemed to refine the proposal, saying the U.S. should screen for terrorist links and also promising, ""I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats."" Like many Americans, I think the better course is to destroy Islamic State while also welcoming newcomers. But there's nothing authoritarian about trying to persuade voters that the country should amend its immigration policies.President Obama clearly knows this, because he spent much of his anti-Trump rant last week criticizing -- not the temporary ban advanced by Mr. Trump -- but abuses against American citizens that Mr. Obama imagines will result from the Trump agenda.Yet Americans don't have to imagine the abuses of the Obama administration. Mr. Obama falsely claimed the power to determine when Congress is in recess. He asserted the ability to waive immigration law for millions of people. Does using the IRS against philosophical opponents count as authoritarian?No evidence has been uncovered tying Mr. Obama to the IRS targeting scandal. But since he proclaimed that it involved ""not even a smidgen of corruption"" long before his government had finished investigating, and has made no serious effort to reform the agency, he now bears some responsibility.Mr. Trump has made inappropriate or mean-spirited remarks about all kinds of people. But does this mean he's marching the U.S. toward Nuremberg? For the pundits who claim to worry, let's hunt for similarities between Donald Trump and the dictators so much on the minds of media folk.One trait that ties Donald Trump to some of recent history's most significant authoritarians is that they achieved many of their goals as relatively young men. While in their 30s, Hitler took over what would become known as the Nazi party, Fidel Castro overthrew the Cuban government, Mussolini created the Fascist movement in Italy and Mr. Trump purchased the property on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th that would become Trump Tower, a mix of luxury retail, office space and residential condos.By his early 60s Stalin had killed millions of his countrymen. At the same age, Mr. Trump had already offered a signature collection of shirts, ties, cuff links, eyewear and leather goods. He has also peddled furniture, mattresses, bedding, lighting, home decor and more. Did Stalin ever have his own fragrance?Mr. Trump has produced plenty of failures, but they occurred in the world of commerce, where customers get to decide whether a venture and its leader succeed. Authoritarians wouldn't know much about that.The rule of law and the honest, open government that Americans cherish, and that allow them to make their own choices, are always threatened by those who seek dominion over free people. But the U.S. has more than two centuries of constitutional order on its side. Despite differences and evolving views on many issues, Americans still love freedom. And thanks to its liberal political leanings, the free press will be a much more reliable check on a President Trump than it has been on Mr. Obama or would be on another President Clinton.The facts suggest that Mrs. Clinton is more likely to abuse liberties than Mr. Trump. Only one candidate in this election cycle has run for president while refusing to cooperate with a federal investigation into her conduct in a previous office. Only one candidate is on record opposing the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Only one candidate condemns the Supreme Court for allowing a movie critical of her to be distributed and advertised.Besides seeking to silence critics, another hallmark of authoritarians is that they abhor honest, fair elections. Mr. Trump, unlike the Democratic National Committee of the Bill Clinton era, has never had to return more than $1 million in donations because they were tied to foreign sources and likely illegal.America managed to survive Mr. Clinton's two terms, so it can stand the far less vulgar Mr. Trump. The question is how long it can survive if it elects presidents with a record of opposing constitutional rule of law.---Mr. Freeman is assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page.Credit: By James Freeman",9/2/16

Election 2016: Trump Seizes Upon 'Brexit',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799817717?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, celebrating the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, took the historic decision as a sign that the world is awash with nationalist, anti-elite sentiment that will propel his candidacy in the U.S.The British vote came at a time when Mr. Trump's presidential campaign has been faltering in polls, and questions have been raised, by allies and adversaries alike, about the strength of the anti-immigrant, populist wave that is carrying him to the GOP nomination.Developments in Britain emboldened Mr. Trump, who happened to be in Scotland when the results were announced, to declare that the wave of discontent is international and not fading.""They're not happy with the people flowing into the country,"" Mr. Trump said while visiting his renovated golf resort on the western coast of Scotland. ""We're on the other side of the ocean, but the world is not so different.""His Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, argued that the vote is the latest tumultuous chapter in world affairs that calls for a tested leader like her, not an unpredictable neophyte like Mr. Trump.""This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House,"" Mrs. Clinton said.Meanwhile, President Barack Obama acknowledged that the British vote reflected deep undercurrents of economic distress that reach across the Atlantic.The dramatic vote was just the latest surprise to unsettle the 2016 election. The campaign to leave the EU drew strength from frustration with the economic and political system, and from anxiety about immigration. Those same concerns have been central to the stunning rise of Mr. Trump, and the populist component has fueled the unexpectedly strong primary run by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side against Mrs. Clinton.""A lot of people are being left behind in this global economy,"" Mr. Sanders said on CBS on Friday. ""The establishment sometimes forgets that real live, flesh-and-blood people in this country are hurting, and they're hurting badly.""In one measure of Americans' frustration, an April survey by GOP pollster David Winston found that 79% of those surveyed believed that their voice wasn't heard in political and public-policy discourse.Pat Buchanan, who ran insurgent campaigns for the Republican nomination in 1992 and 1996 that included harsh rhetoric about immigrants, said that politicians of both parties ignore people's frustration to their peril.""The movement for economic nationalism and ethno-nationalism and the preservation of national identity is far stronger than the elites realize, because the people who believe these things are constantly being berated and called names,"" he said in an interview.Mrs. Clinton and her aides countered that the U.S. and British elections have little in common, and that American voters are being asked to make a very different choice than the one facing the U.K. The ballot in Britain was a referendum on staying in the EU and not a choice between candidates, they said.Clinton aides said in a conference call with reporters that the vote would reinforce doubts about Mr. Trump and remind voters that Mrs. Clinton, the former diplomat, has deep experience in coping with global turmoil.Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Ireland on Friday, took a veiled shot at Mr. Trump, warning that the dark side of political and economic instability in Europe and elsewhere is providing ""fertile terrain for reactionary politicians and demagogues,"" and that to turn inward is ""un-American.""Jake Sullivan, a senior campaign adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said that Mr. Trump is ""rooting for economic turmoil"" touched off by Britain's decision. ""He actually put his golf business ahead of the interests of working families in the United States,"" Mr. Sullivan said.Mr. Sullivan was reacting to a comment Mr. Trump made during a remarkable news conference on the ninth hole of his Trump Turnberry golf resort, when he was asked about the global market slump following the election results. ""If the pound goes down, they are going to do more business,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry.""The Republican presidential candidate's assessment came after he had spent 15 minutes discussing the details of his golf and hotel renovation. At one point, he suggested his success at the Turnberry was a metaphor for what he could do as president, at a time when much of the country's infrastructure was in need of repair.""This is a little bit of what we are going to do to the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a place that needs to be fixed, and there's nobody who knows how to fix things like me.""Mr. Trump wasted no time in bringing the spirit of the Brexit fight into his campaign. Before the day was out Friday, he had sent out a fundraising email praising U.K. voters.""These voters stood up for their nation -- they put the United Kingdom first and they took their country back,"" he said in the email asking for donations. ""Let's send another shockwave around the world.""---Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: Janet Hook, Reid J. Epstein, Stu Woo",9/7/16
Declarations: Donald Trump Is No Ronald Reagan,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799324684?accountid=12768,"It was at dinner a month ago in a Manhattan restaurant. Old friends who live far apart had come together on a leisurely spring night. But it turned testy fast.I note here that the style of anti-Trumpers is often highhanded and manipulative, while the style of pro-Trumpers can be brutalist and patronizing. One couple, my old friends, had been for Marco Rubio and then John Kasich and were now enthusiastically for Donald Trump. Last year they hadn't liked him, but now they thought wait, he's the donkey we need to knock over the barn.There was another couple, intellectuals, also pro-Trump but from early on, and with a certain edge. The lady of that couple, disliking recent criticism of Mr. Trump in these columns, was not jolly but defensive. She leaned in and said that what I didn't understand was that Donald Trump is Ronald Reagan -- an outsider, disliked by the elites, looked down on, a TV star. And yet he became . . . Reagan.I hear this a lot, mostly from idiots, but this time I engaged.Look, Mr. Trump is not Ronald Reagan, I said. Reagan served two full terms as the governor of a state so vast that if it were a country it would have been one of the important economies in the world. He was a union president who served seven terms during the most fraught time in Hollywood's history and emerged respected by all sides. He was no novice.He was the leader of an entire political movement (however nascent) for more than a decade before taking the White House. Yes he had been an entertainer, an actor, and had loved it and seen himself as an artist. And it is true that he was looked down on by liberal elites. But it is not true that nobody respected him. The people elected him in landslides.She moved her mouth in the way people do when they're reminding themselves it isn't polite to bite people in restaurants.""Reagan wasn't Reagan in 1980,"" she explained.""That is exactly who he was,"" I said.No, she replied: He hadn't had his triumphs yet. People didn't know he would go on to be who he was.I said that they knew who he was based on his history and previous accomplishments which is why they felt free to make him president.We went round and round, and in the end resolved nothing.But what I thought for weeks afterward was: Trump supporters, please stop this. The man you back has never held office and has not proved himself as a leader of men. You have to include that in your arguments.It is probably the case this year that most voters see the issue of character as null and void -- neither candidate is admirable in that area. As for personality, I suppose it's a matter of taste. But it must be noted that the most consequential decision of Reagan's young presidency, when he fired the striking air-traffic controllers, was determined wholly by Reagan's character -- by his guts and willingness to gamble for what he was certain was right.Trump supporters should be able to make an affirmative case for their candidate without diminishing Reagan or anyone else. You shouldn't cut down a man you know was great to make him fit your candidate's size. It is poor political etiquette. It's also historical parallelism gone mad. Mr. Trump isn't Reagan, and he isn't Andrew Jackson either. He's Mr. Trump. Take him on his terms and make the case.You can say that the old standards have been swept away, that when it comes to character we're a changed nation, that Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton are the result of that decline, and that you pick from among the candidates on offer.You can argue, if you see it this way, that you detect in Mr. Trump a vein of old-fashioned America-loving patriotism. Maybe you suspect, or at least hope, that after a long career serving only himself -- getting rich, chasing glamour -- he wants to apply his last energies to serving the country that made him possible, and in which his children will live.You can argue that Mr. Trump is the kind of electric figure who will give Washington a jolt -- maybe he represents more current than the system can tolerate, maybe he'll blow all the circuits, but maybe he'll force a helpful reset of the grid.You can say of Mr. Trump, as one of his supporters did, that the body politic is sick and he is the enema Washington needs.You can argue that the Republican Party was frozen by accepted wisdom and beholden to donors, but now, in a stroke, new thinking on immigration, trade and entitlement spending is ascendant. You can argue that Trump, just by showing up, has begun to break the policy logjam between the party and half its base. He has broken a brain-dead consensus.You can argue what Franklin Roosevelt is said to have remarked when he appointed Joe Kennedy as first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission: that it takes a thief to catch a thief.You can say, as a veteran Manhattan media leader, not known as a conservative, recently did, that Hillary will do nothing good but Donald might, if even by accident. He intends to vote for Mr. Trump, but adds: ""It will all end in tears.""You can begin a case, an argument, in all these areas.But you can't say that Mr. Trump is Ronald Reagan, because he is not, and you sound desperate and historically illiterate when you insist he is.Stop trying to paint Reagan's portrait into Mr. Trump.Paint Mr. Trump.---I close with Trump cooties.Donald Trump needs serious, substantive people to help with his campaign and advise him in foreign and domestic policy. But some will not join him because they don't want to get Trump cooties. They don't want the stigma of working with him.Some are sincere -- they don't approve of him. But many fear having their careers associated with him and with what they expect will be his inevitable failure either in the White House or on the way there.Those fears might be lessened if Mr. Trump took the moral advice offered by Hugh Hewitt this Thursday on his radio show. Mr. Hewitt told Mr. Trump to ""rebuke the crazy one percent"" who are Trump supporters but also anti-Semitic and racist.Mr. Trump indicated that he understood and said he has rejected them ""so strongly and so harshly."" He felt he hadn't been given credit for this.So we'll go back to Reagan. When he was running for governor he was criticized after the John Birch Society, which had accused Dwight Eisenhower of being a communist, came out for him. Reagan said, as I recall, that the Birchers were buying his philosophy, not the other way around.Clear enough and did the job.Maybe if Trump wants to be compared to Reagan he should act more like him.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",9/7/16

""His main tactic is that he makes demands no else dreams of making.""Omarosa, who is now known by her first name only, is a former political aide who was rescued from obscurity in 2004 by ""The Apprentice"" reality-television show and has since become a Trump campaign surrogate. She continues in the book: ""In the late '70s and early '80s, when no one else was offering high-end luxury living in New York City, Mr. Trump negotiated unique deals that allowed him to secure loans with little collateral, and he strategically took advantage of sizable tax breaks. His strategy was simple! He simply asked!""There are dozens of books like ""The Bitch Switch"" by and about Donald Trump, and over the past few months I've read most of them. The presumptive Republican nominee has published over the years like a Victorian novelist -- 18 titles and counting. But the franchise has grown to include his lieutenants, business partners, proteges, and current and former family members.In general, this secondary Trump literature belongs to the same genre as ""The Art of the Deal,"" Mr. Trump's seminal 1987 merger of business self-help and autobiography. His imitators rarely match such greatness, or even the quality of his lesser works, such as 2007's ""Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and in Life.""But several authors are more insightful, and while Mr. Trump likes to say he has ""the best words,"" theirs are no less instructive. These associates witnessed firsthand how he leads, operates, makes decisions and treats other people -- in a word, how he thinks. Though no one can inhabit the mind of another, their testimony is as close as we can get to what Mr. Trump has called his ""very good brain."" It's also a window on how he might behave as president.Consider George H. Ross, Mr. Trump's real-estate lawyer for 30 years, who describes himself as the businessman's ""closest advisor."" In Mr. Ross's 2006 how-to manual, ""Trump-Style Negotiation: Powerful Strategies and Tactics for Mastering Every Deal,"" he observes: ""To my knowledge, Donald Trump has no negotiating weaknesses except maybe the fact that he doesn't like to discuss minor details. He lacks the patience to work on unimportant paperwork, because he likes to focus on the big picture as a more productive usage of his time.""Mr. Ross admires Mr. Trump, but he thinks this indifference is a fairly lethal weakness. Bad negotiators share an ""inability to focus on the details,"" he explains elsewhere in the book. ""Trust me when I say the devil is in the details."" Then he adds: ""You want to be the expert on the topic under negotiation"" (his italics). Mr. Ross even advises readers who wind up across the negotiating table with ""someone who thinks like Donald Trump"" to offer to bore his subordinate with the minutiae. ""This gives you complete control over the documentation process and who will make the day-to-day decisions. You have uncovered the real deal maker for your transaction -- and it's not the boss.""If this was a critique, one particular boss didn't seem to recognize it. ""I like to work in broad strokes, deal with the big picture, but not the details,"" Mr. Trump writes in the foreword. ""For the details, I rely almost entirely on George."" Vladimir Putin, take note.Another tell-all expose reports: ""Donald's mind moved between very simple polarities: there were only 'positives' and 'negatives,' to use his own terminology, 'winners' and 'losers.'"" That is from John R. O'Donnell's ""Trumped!: The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump"" (1991), in which the author surveys his time as chief operating officer of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City during the late 1980s.Mr. O'Donnell is not a Trump fan, so perhaps he is unreliable when he reveals that Mr. Trump does not tip waiters as a matter of principle. Or that the mogul was ""preoccupied with a fear of communicable disease, especially AIDS"" and considered hot tubs ""a potential breeding ground"" for the virus. Or that Mr. Trump believed ""that the human body was like a battery: It stored only so much vitality, and when that was used up, it weakened and died."" He tells Mr. O'Donnell that ""you are going to die young"" because he competed in triathlons.Mr. Trump's ""attention span was so limited that it was impossible to discuss problems with him in any detail"" and he ""did business almost entirely in the moment,"" Mr. O'Donnell writes. This existentialism can confound his subordinates.Barbara Res, the engineer in charge of the construction of Trump Tower, notes that he had a policy of spending money only where it could be seen. Thus while his lobbies are extravagant, the apartments were floored in glue-down laminates, ""the kind you would find in subsidized housing,"" Ms. Res reveals in ""All Alone on the 68th Floor: How One Woman Changed the Face of Construction"" (2013).But the principal was often enraged by his own choices. In one project, Ms. Res was installing ""a Chinese stand-in for a Vermont marble called antique verde. . . . Donald took one look at this marble and started screaming at me. He was shaking. . . . I said, 'Look Donald, this is the marble you approved. It was cheap, you wanted to save money. Don't blame me.' It was like pouring gasoline on a fire. His face was red. His mouth was all twisted and I thought to myself, if he hits you, just take a fall.""Carolyn Kepcher, who used to run Trump golf courses and was an ""Apprentice"" co-star, describes an instance when Mr. Trump put off an important decision for six months: ""All right, I said to myself, he is teaching me a lesson, like a Zen master, pointing toward something I need to learn. Or, just possibly, he forgot about it.""In 2004's ""Carolyn 101: Business Lessons from the Apprentice's Straight Shooter,"" she blames herself: ""My biggest failure had been to assume that Mr. Trump's response would be predictable. I should have never expected predictability from Donald Trump.""'The message I got at home was to take extra-special care with other people's time,"" daughter Ivanka Trump writes in ""The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life"" (2009). Once, she and Mr. Trump were in his private plane in Palm Beach, waiting for Marla Maples, his second wife and former mistress. Ms. Maples pulled up on the tarmac unfashionably late, ""all frantic and frazzled and running just a bit behind. I tapped my father on the shoulder and told him to look out the window, but when he saw Marla all he did was throw up his hands. He didn't tell the pilot to stop, and we took off anyway.""Mr. Trump's insistence on punctuality sometimes undermines his own interests. In 1988, according to Mr. O'Donnell, he bought a thoroughbred racehorse with Triple Crown potential, named Alibi, which he renamed DJ Trump. When the colt came down with a flu called the ""sniffles"" near the end of its training, its handler suggested postponing workouts so the animal could recuperate.Mr. Trump wanted his investment delivered on schedule and he insisted on running the final exercises. Soon after, the horse collapsed. Veterinarians concluded the physical stress had exacerbated the virus, and they had to amputate DJ Trump's front hooves due to a loss of blood circulation. It would survive as a stud but never run again. Mr. Trump then reneged on the purchase, the book alleges, claiming the seller was ""trying to pass off a lame animal.""The welfare of others was also not a priority in Mr. Trump's first divorce, which Ivana Trump, wife No. 1, reconstructs in her barely disguised roman a clef ""For Love Alone."" In the 1992 novel, Ivana is Katrinka, a Czech beauty, and Donald is Adam, a tycoon who builds yachts instead of skyscrapers. At first, their romance, marriage and ""life of unbelievable luxury"" are out of a storybook.But Adam feels ""perpetually restless, and that each successful coup he pulled off failed to ease his dissatisfaction. Nothing ever lived up to his expectations. Life, he felt, was constantly shortchanging him."" He ""always did exactly what he wanted, no matter whom he inconvenienced or hurt in the process."" Though Katrinka ""could not stop trying to make Adam happy"" and ""keep his love,"" he cheats on the heroine and dumps her.Mrs. Trump sometimes achieves pathos as she conveys the ""unbelievable, bewildering, terrifying"" experience of divorce, and the dissolution of the fictional marriage tracks the in-real-life version. As Mr. Trump did to Ivana, Adam mocks Katrinka's intelligence and broken English to her face at dinner parties. He plants compromising stories on ""Page Seven"" about Katrinka's ""seeking psychiatric advice, taking lovers, making unreasonable financial demands,"" which she calls ""excruciatingly painful.""Mr. O'Donnell says Mr. Trump thought the spectacle was ""great for business,"" even though ""his children, especially his eldest son Donny Jr., were devastated. But there was a business advantage to be gained, or so he thought, and he continued to publicly promote his affair. His family, it seemed, was expendable. He went on record describing Marla as 'better than a 10.'""Despite his wealthy upbringing, ""I have still gone through hard times like anyone else,"" Donald Trump Jr. writes in an essay in ""Chicken Soup for the Soul: Extraordinary Teens: Personal Stories and Advice from Today's Most Inspiring Youth"" (2009). ""I remember when my parents were getting their divorce. I didn't speak to my father for over a year because I attributed the failure of the marriage to him. But in retrospect, it was a great learning experience. The world isn't always this nice, joyous place.""---In ""Trump Strategies for Real Estate: Billionaire Lessons for the Small Investor"" (2005), George Ross identifies the importance of debt to Mr. Trump's business model and psychology. When he invests in a project, ""he typically puts up less of his own money than you might think,"" Mr. Ross writes. He says the Trump strategy is to ""borrow as much as you can for as long as you can"" and ""don't sweat the details.""The details can get you into trouble, as Mr. Trump discovered in the 1990s. In ""The Trump Card,"" daughter Ivanka reminisces about a day when the paterfamilias said he envied a hobo in front of Trump Tower. ""At least he doesn't owe any money. He's got nothing, but I owe $900 million."" Ms. Trump applauds how ""with just the right mix of stamina, stubbornness and savvy, my father found his way to the other side of that crisis."" (Not to mention haircuts for his creditors.)Mr. Trump's fascination with debt brought him together in the 2000s with Robert Kiyosaki, a motivational speaker whose ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" series became a personal-finance sensation. He told consumers to avoid saving and diversified mutual funds in favor of distressed real estate and thinly traded stocks.In ""Why We Want You to Be Rich"" (2006), Mr. Kiyosaki recalls a conversation in Mr. Trump's office about their unusual investment portfolios. Mr. Trump told him: ""You and I look at making money as a game. We have fun. We enjoy the game. Sometimes we lose, but mainly we win. We have fun. But most people don't look at making money as a game."" It was a ""financial tragedy,"" he added. ""Their loss of money?"" Mr. Kiyosaki asked. ""No, the fun they miss out on,"" Mr. Trump replied. ""Making money is fun. Life is supposed to be fun. And millions of people are living in fear instead of having fun.""---Mr. Rago is a member of the Journal's editorial board.Credit: By Joseph Rago",9/7/16

"Hard Truths for Trump's America; Washington didn't kill coal, but disaffected voters are being sold a story of victimhood.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1818963977?accountid=12768,"If there is a ""war on coal,"" as Donald Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell allege, it has been under way for a very long time. In Mr. McConnell's home state of Kentucky, coal mine employment peaked at 75,633 in 1948. It fell by two-thirds to about 25,000 in the late 1960s, before doubling to more than 50,000 in the late 1970s. It has since fallen virtually without interruption and now stands at 6,465.Much the same is true for West Virginia, the epicenter of Appalachian angst. The state's coal industry employed close to 120,000 workers in 1950. By the time John F. Kennedy campaigned against Hubert Humphrey in the state's 1960 primary, the total stood at less than 50,000. After a temporary recovery in the 1970s and another in the first decade of the current century, about 15,000 remain.Many forces have combined to decimate coal jobs since their mid-20th century peak. According to a 2014 official report from the state government of Kentucky, the principal culprit has been the ""automation and mechanization of mining processes, which have improved mining productivity."" Another factor is ""diminishing reserves of thick and easily accessible coal seams."" What remains is ""more difficult, labor-intensive, and costly to mine."" A 2012 report from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, a think tank in Charleston, W.Va., offers much the same account.As a result, coal faces intensified competitive pressure from natural gas produced through hydraulic fracturing. The U.S. Energy and Information Administration expects this to persist over the next decade.Both state reports also cite an additional factor: recent federal regulations of greenhouse gases and mercury. But neither regards these policies as a primary cause of coal's decline. That argument would be absurd on its face, because nearly all the reduction in mining employment occurred before the federal government even began trying to reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuels.It is irresponsible for politicians to suggest that these mining jobs will return; they can't and won't. And even if mining recovered modestly, it would make at best a small contribution to coal states' economies. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, mining and logging now account for only 3% of West Virginia's total employment and less than 1% of Kentucky's. Coal is less an economic development issue than a potent symbol in the partisan culture war. The future lies elsewhere.Real economic recovery in Appalachia--the heart of Red America--requires facing some hard truths. As of 2015, according to the Census Bureau, West Virginia had the fourth-lowest median household income in the country, and Kentucky the second-lowest. Although neither state is a hub for high-wage jobs, the real problem is that so few of their denizens do any work at all. West Virginia has the lowest labor-force participation rate of any state in the country, 53%, and Kentucky the seventh-lowest, 58.5%. Although older than average populations are a contributing factor, that isn't the big story: Among prime working-age adults, age 25 to 54, West Virginia ranks dead last, Kentucky next to last.Here again, we are dealing with longstanding, deeply entrenched forces. The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy reports that the state's labor-force participation has ranked last every year since 1976, consistently lagging the national average by at least 9 percentage points. Low levels of educational attainment help explain this gap, as does poor health. West Virginians are twice as likely as the average American to receive federal disability payments. Indeed, the share of the state's adult population dependent on Social Security Disability Insurance is the highest in the country. (Kentucky ranks fourth.)J.D. Vance, the author of the surprise best-seller ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" writes about running into a hometown acquaintance who said he had quit his job because he was ""sick of waking up early."" Mr. Vance subsequently saw him complaining on Facebook about the ""Obama economy."" This man, he comments, is not a victim: His situation is ""directly attributable to the choices he's made."" But nothing in his environment forces him to look in the mirror and ask tough questions about himself. On the contrary, Mr. Vance insists: ""There is a cultural movement in the white working class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains adherents by the day.""The author of ""Hillbilly Elegy"" is a self-described conservative, but he criticizes his fellow conservatives for failing to tell their constituents the truth. Instead, the message of the right, Mr. Vance says, is: ""It's not your fault that you're a loser; it's the government's fault.""For decades conservatives have castigated liberals for abandoning the language of personal responsibility and turning their constituents into helpless victims. Now, led by Donald Trump, populist conservatives are doing just that.Credit: By William A. Galston",9/14/16
It's Past Time to Retire the Electoral College; Trump voters will not stand quietly by if electors overturn the voice of the people.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1818751388?accountid=12768,"David B. Rivkin Jr. and Andrew M. Grossman claim the Electoral College was instituted by the founders in presidential elections to prevent populism (""Let the Electoral College Do Its Duty ,"" op-ed, Sept. 8).Populism is the right of voters to control their government to the exclusion of a few political insiders. In most states, electors are nominated by the party winning the popular vote in November. These electors then vote for the president in December. A majority of electors (currently 270) is required to elect the president. This effectively disenfranchises losing voters in every state. Since this is an election for president of ""all the people,"" common sense says the national majority of voters should determine the president, just as the majority of voters in each state elect governors, senators and representatives. This has not always been the case, e.g., 2000 when Al Gore beat George W. Bush by over 500,000 votes but lost the election.Messrs. Rivkin and Grossman carry this a step further by claiming electors should not be bound by the popular vote in any state. This takes the election even a step further from a true democracy. No state of which I am aware requires the election of electors by county or city. If you feel disenfranchised now under their plan, we'll be approaching dictatorship.Ralph JeddaPeoria, Ariz.Messrs. Rivkin and Grossman are looking for ways the Electoral College can save the country if Peggy Noonan's ""unprotected"" group produces an electoral vote majority for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. As an academic exercise, their approach is interesting. In the real world, it threatens to tear the country apart.Trump voters are opposing decades of perceived indifference and maneuvering by the ""protected class."" They trust no insiders--the courts, and media least of all--and will not stand quietly by if electors overturn the voice of the people.Dale SteinackerDurham, N.C.The premise of the Electoral College was to mimic the representational dynamic of the Congress, which assumed that it was both risky and impractical to allow the people to vote directly on matters of great importance; risky because the people were largely uneducated, and impractical because they were scattered across the rural vastness of the colonies, with no means of communicating quickly or easily. It was also a compromise to avoid the thorny issue of black suffrage (or lack thereof) in the South. Everything about this has changed, yet we continue to apply an 18th-century mechanism to the task of electing our presidents.Especially in an election year like this one, when one of the presidential candidates has already declared the system ""rigged,"" the integrity of the national vote is at greater risk because it rests on an indirect, inconsistent, state-reliant mechanism that is susceptible to political manipulation and opportunistic legal attack such as the one mounted by the authors. Forget Russian hackers; we should be worried about American lawyers.Our very peculiar Electoral College has outlived its dubious usefulness. Unfortunately, direct popular vote in presidential elections can only be instituted by constitutional amendment, which was most recently proposed in the wake of Richard Nixon's narrow popular win over Hubert Humphrey in 1968. It had a good chance of success and was backed by Nixon himself but was filibustered to death in the Senate before it reached the states.Time to try again.Keith McWalterGranville, Ohio",9/14/16
Election 2016: Trump Appears to Backpedal on Muslim Ban,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805520157?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump appears to be backing away from one of his signature and most controversial proposals -- banning Muslims from entering the U.S. -- as polls show him falling slightly behind Hillary Clinton.Since Mr. Trump essentially clinched the GOP presidential nomination in May, amid widespread popularity of his proposed ban among primary voters, he has gradually moved away from a blanket religious ban and toward a more nuanced policy targeting countries with a record of terrorism.Mr. Trump's policy director, Stephen Miller, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday, ""The best way to prevent continued radicalization from developing inside America is to suspend temporarily immigration from regions that have been a major source for terrorists and their supporters coming to the U.S.""But the evolution of the policy has come in fits and starts, with conflicting statements by Mr. Trump that have confused some of his strongest supporters on Capitol Hill. Mr. Trump has never said he was wrong about the temporary Muslim ban or explicitly said he was abandoning that policy.Asked about the confusion, one of Mr. Trump's top foreign-policy advisers, retired Rear Adm. Charles Kubic, said he was ""working with the campaign to address this issue."" He said he expected a statement from the campaign headquarters this week.Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Mr. Kubic was not advising the campaign on this issue. But another Trump representative, Katrina Pierson, confirmed the policy was being clarified. ""Mr. Trump is going to be refining his policy, putting out specifics, which everyone's been asking for,"" she said on CNN.Mr. Trump was tied with Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in late May and now lags by more than 6 percentage points, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey showed him with 41% support, compared with 46% for Mrs. Clinton.Counter-terrorism and national-security experts who disagreed with a Muslim ban said a geographic immigration policy still raised concerns, because Mr. Trump so far had not detailed which countries would qualify and how he would measure their records on terrorism.Typically, presidential candidates travel abroad to flaunt their foreign-policy chops, but Mr. Trump's first trip overseas this past weekend was focused on promoting his new golf course in Scotland. When pressed by reporters for details on his national-security policies, Mr. Trump said he would block immigrants from ""countries with great terrorism.""Two of Mr. Trump's foreign-policy advisers on Monday said they were unavailable for comment or didn't have permission to speak to reporters.Carl Paladino, the 2010 Republican gubernatorial nominee in New York and a top Trump supporter, said he didn't think Mr. Trump was changing his national-security policy.""I don't think it was ever a ban directed at religion,"" said Mr. Paladino, who attended a recent speech by Mr. Trump in Manhattan that focused on banning Syrian refugees who haven't been properly vetted, rather than Muslims.Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Damian Paletta",9/14/16
"Election 2016: Some Business Leaders Abandon GOP --- Clinton to get backing from executives, some of whom cite unease with Trump candidacy",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798955462?accountid=12768,"More than 50 business executives, including several longtime Republicans, will endorse Hillary Clinton for president on Thursday as her campaign seeks to capitalize on discomfort with Republican Donald Trump.They include Jim Cicconi, senior executive vice president at AT&T Services Inc., and Dan Akerson, who held top positions at General Motors Co. and Nextel Communications Inc. A Clinton campaign aide provided the list and said it would be distributed widely on Thursday.The endorsements reflect continuing unease among some Republicans with the presumptive GOP presidential nominee despite his romp through the primary contest.Mr. Cicconi, who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said he has backed every GOP presidential candidate since 1976. ""But this year I think it's vital to put our country's well being ahead of party,"" he said. ""Hillary Clinton is experienced, qualified, and will make a fine president. The alternative, I fear, would set our nation on a very dark path.""Mr. Akerson said he has consistently voted for Republicans for president in the past but couldn't support Mr. Trump. ""Serving as the leader of the free world requires effective leadership, sound judgment, a steady hand and most importantly, the temperament to deal with crises large and small. Donald Trump lacks each of these characteristics,"" said Mr. Akerson, who also served as a Navy surface warfare officer.On Wednesday, Brent Scowcroft, a national security adviser for two Republican presidents, endorsed Mrs. Clinton, saying her experience, judgment and understanding of the world prepare her for the job of commander in chief. His support comes a week after Richard Armitage, another longtime Republican foreign-policy hand, said he would back Mrs. Clinton if, as expected, Mr. Trump is the GOP nominee.After a slow start, Mr. Trump is racing to shore up his standing with his party's establishment and in recent weeks has been making overtures to top GOP donors, many of whom supported others in the primaries and haven't been quick to warm to him.Mr. Trump attended a fundraiser at Le Cirque in New York City on Tuesday, attended by hedge-fund manager John Paulson, who had backed four of his rivals during the Republican primaries.He also attended a breakfast Wednesday at Cipriani in Midtown, co-hosted by New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, a billionaire who had supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Last week, Mr. Trump raised money in Texas, meeting with several of his party's wealthiest donors.After a low fundraising haul in May, Mr. Trump has raised at least $19 million for his joint fund with the Republican National Committee in recent weeks and about $3 million for his campaign, people familiar with the matter said.Senior Clinton policy adviser Jake Sullivan briefed several of her supporters from the business community on a conference call Wednesday, during which he outlined the economic agenda she laid out in a pair of speeches this week, as well as her critique of Mr. Trump's record and policies.The list of business leaders backing her includes several who have supported Democrats in the past, including Eric Schmidt of Alphabet Inc., Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook Inc., and Warren Buffett of Berkshire-Hathaway, Inc.Others endorsing the former secretary of state include Hollywood-turned-internet executive Barry Diller of IAC/InterActiveCorp; Hollywood executive Peter Chernin, of The Chernin Group; Wendell Weeks of Corning Inc.; Reed Hastings of Netflix Inc.; and Rob Marcus, formerly of Time Warner Inc.---Rebecca Ballhaus and Rachel Ensign contributed to this article.Credit: By Laura Meckler",9/14/16

""He has no real strategy for creating jobs -- just a string of empty promises,"" she said. ""And maybe we shouldn't expect better from someone whose most famous words are, 'You're fired.'""Mr. Trump, in one of his first major addresses of the general election, accused Mrs. Clinton of using her post as secretary of State during President Barack Obama's first term to enrich herself.He also said her policies destabilized the Middle East and North Africa, and that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, accepted speaking fees and contributions to their family's charitable foundation from Wall Street and foreign governments.""Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft,"" Mr. Trump told an audience of about 100 people at a New York hotel bearing his name. ""She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others . . . in exchange for cash, pure and simple.""Asked for response, Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said Mr. Trump was offering ""lies and nutty conspiracy theories"" to distract from economic policies that, he said, would cause a recession. ""Donald Trump continues to prove that he is unqualified and unfit to be president,"" he said.Mrs. Clinton included several references to her Methodist faith in her speech, a day after Mr. Trump told a group of social conservatives that ""we don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion."" ""All he can do is try to distract us. That's even why he's attacking my faith,"" she said.Mr. Trump's remarks marked his campaign's latest attempt to show that he can unify a Republican Party that is increasingly worried about his comportment, his small campaign organization and an embryonic finance team that has lagged far behind Mrs. Clinton's fundraising efforts.His speech echoed themes and phrases used for months by one of his top policy aides, Stephen Miller, in introducing Mr. Trump to crowds at rallies across the country.Mr. Trump didn't mention one of his campaign's most provocative proposals: a ban on Muslim immigrants entering the country, which he first offered in December after the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings and restated last week after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump twice mentioned the threat that terrorists pose to ""peaceful Muslims"" and focused on blocking Syrian refugees who haven't been properly vetted.But the thrust of his speech was aimed at Mrs. Clinton, one day after she delivered a speech claiming Mr. Trump would ""bankrupt"" the U.S. economy.Mr. Trump blamed the former secretary of State for the deaths of four Americans in the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, and said that her foreign policies helped Islamic State rise to power.""Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched,"" Mr. Trump said. ""In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.""Clinton campaign aides expect Mr. Trump to continue to target her personally in the course of the campaign and said she would be selective in how she responds, in an effort to avoid trading insults continually with Mr. Trump.In another sign that Mr. Trump's campaign is making adjustments, a newly revved-up press operation fired off one attack after another during Mrs. Clinton's speechon Tuesday, in which she bashed Mr. Trump's potential stewardship of the economy.

A Trump-Ryan Condominium,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1798937529?accountid=12768,"""A Condominium envisions the joint exercise of sovereignty over a single piece of territory, often arising when two sovereigns cannot agree on the boundary between two territories which each controls alone.""-- UCLA Journal of International LawThe Republican presidential campaign is locked up because two sovereigns cannot agree.Let us first hear from Paul Ryan, the sovereign known as the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, on the subject of voting for what he called ""a very unique nominee"": ""The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that's contrary to their conscience.""Standing opposite on the Republican battlefield is Donald J. Trump, presumptive nominee of the GOP. Of the Ryan conscience alliance he says: ""You know, the Republicans, honestly folks, our leaders, our leaders have to get tougher. This is too tough to do it alone. But you know what, I think I'm going to be forced to. I think I am going to be forced to.""Consider the balance of forces between these two.Paul Ryan leads a Republican House delegation that represents 247 congressional districts across the U.S. These men and women embody millions of individual voters.Donald Trump, as he often notes, accumulated about 14 million votes from Republicans and independents in the presidential primaries.One hesitates to call this a Mexican standoff. Still, no truer axiom exists today than that these two political bastions, the house of Ryan and the family of Trump, must hang together or they will hang separately.Running by himself, as he is now, Mr. Trump is surely headed for the cliff. Landing atop him in historic ignominy will be Republican control of Congress.The moment has come for a Trump-Ryan condominium.The basis for the deal is lying in plain sight. It is the elements of Mr. Ryan's House Republican policy agenda on the economy, taxes, energy, national security, health care and, yes, poverty.Let us be clear about the current baseline: Donald Trump cannot win with what he's doing now -- running on little money and less policy.Indeed, Mr. Trump's substantive tank has run so low that as far as I can tell, he hasn't mentioned ""the wall"" in about a week. The wall helped get him to this point, but it won't be enough to get him to Pennsylvania Avenue.He needs more to run on, and he needs it fast, before the Cleveland convention and its growing delegate rebellion.The Ryan House agenda, ""A Better Way,"" is complete, published in short and long versions, and is the explicit consensus of the Republican Party, the party Mr. Trump promised to unify.The House agenda is the Trump Rosetta Stone. It is an off-the-shelf template for getting through the next five months. It is a way for the party's nominee and its stressed-out candidates to sing from the same hymnal rather than threaten to stab each other in the back.If Donald Trump doesn't like the House sections on free trade, he doesn't have to sing those parts. At least 90% of the ideas -- which many House Republicans worked on, argued over and produced -- would be common ground between them and Mr. Trump.We'll elaborate on just one element, which could cause anxiety among Democrats -- poverty.It's long been thought that any Republican who could pull more than 15% of the black vote would put his Democratic opponent on thin ice. Black Americans, especially younger black Democrats, are disaffected. The Obama economy has been harder on them than on anyone.The Ryan-House poverty proposal is about one idea: upward mobility, about not getting stuck for generations in the same welfare dead end. Donald Trump should deliver the Trumpian version of the House's ideas on getting ahead to black voters in tough states. That's what Chris Christie did in New Jersey and Bruce Rauner did in Illinois -- and what Mitt Romney did not do in 2012.There is also a crude case for a Trump-Ryan peace agreement: It can be the basis for fundraising. Big contributors aren't losers. They got on the donor A-list because they succeeded at something in private life. Those people won't give money without some concrete idea of what the Trump game plan is.Absent a common policy agenda to normalize fundraising, these donors will transfer their money to a parallel Republican campaign to save the Senate or the House. They will let Mr. Trump sink, which he will without party support.Donald Trump says he'll rely on the Republican National Committee's in-state campaign machinery. But the operations that those states and Reince Priebus created for 2016 are all treading water. Volunteers in a Virginia, Ohio, Florida or Colorado need something to talk about on doorsteps beyond stop Hillary and make America great again. The House Republican agenda is already printed up, with bullet points.The Trump-Ryan condominium would finally put a GOP presidential campaign in forward motion. At least half the country's voters think that moment is overdue.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",9/14/16
Donald Trump Is a Few Years Behind on the China Currency Problem,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1820014719?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says he will label China a currency manipulator if he's in the White House. He's a little late , says Ian Talley of The Wall Street Journal. Many economists believe that after decades of yuan undervaluation, the Chinese currency is now close to its fair exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, Mr. Talley writes. ""In fact, over the last two years, Beijing burned through nearly a quarter of what was once a $4 trillion currency stockpile to prevent the yuan from falling against the dollar,"" he says. ""The yuan has still weakened against the dollar as the U.S. economy strengthened and the Federal Reserve signaled an end to its cheap-money policies. But it hasn't fallen nearly as fast or as far as many expected it could or should go.That effort actually prevents the U.S.-China trade deficit from worsening.""",9/16/16
"What's a Reagan Internationalist to Do? Unlike Trump, the former secretary of state has an actual record of mistakes and bad judgment in foreign policy.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1819242065?accountid=12768,"The election of 2016 offers a dismal choice for internationalist foreign-policy conservatives in the Reagan tradition.Donald Trump has repudiated the main staples of Reagan's moral democratic realism, routinely disdaining the value of alliances with fellow democracies such as NATO, Japan, South Korea and India; advocating conciliation rather than firmness toward an increasingly authoritarian and expansionist Vladimir Putin; and ignoring the gathering military danger of a Chinese tyranny's military buildup aimed at dominating East Asia, the world's most important geopolitical region for the 21st century.Yet the internationalist conservatives who endorse Hillary Clinton delude themselves if they think things would be better with a President Clinton. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton served loyally as President Obama's first mate on his foreign-policy Titanic. And unlike Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton has an actual record of mistakes and bad judgment in foreign policy.Consider:Hillary Clinton named the ill-fated reset with Mr. Putin, subverting Ukraine's independence and imperiling America's Eastern European NATO allies fearful of becoming Mr. Putin's next target. She also blocked efforts to place the murderous Boko Haram on the State Department's list of international sponsors of terrorism, fostering the Obama administration's fictitious narrative that killing Osama bin Laden had ended the war on terror.Mrs. Clinton--emblematic of the administration's unwillingness to acknowledge radical Islam as a danger--blamed the attack on the Libyan Embassy on a Coptic Christian video denigrating Islam rather than on the obvious culprits and their Islamist motivations timed for the anniversary of 9/11. She fatuously called Syria's Bashar Assad a reformer with whom we could do business, and she touted the absurd notion that American ""smart power"" could substitute for American resolve, moral clarity and military might.Mrs. Clinton remained silent, too, on President Obama's systematic, unwise and dishonorable obsession with putting distance between the U.S. and a democratic Israel while conciliating the worst and most anti-American regimes in international politics. Candidate Clinton still defends an indefensible Iran deal she advocated as secretary of state that puts Iran on the autobahn to crossing the nuclear threshold while tranquilizing Americans to the gathering danger.Her choice of running mate, Tim Kaine, has the dubious distinction of being in the vanguard of the apologists for an untenable agreement subsidizing a virulently aggressive anti-American Iran while likely triggering a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region.Even after the June terrorist attack in Orlando, Mrs. Clinton could barely utter the words Islamic radicalism, intimating that the weapons rather than the motivations of those wielding them deserved primary blame. That's the equivalent of blaming Pearl Harbor on military aviation rather than the Imperial Japanese regime.As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton bears heavy responsibility for the debacle in Libya. She was the administration's leading proponent for American intervention under the auspices of the United Nations, NATO and the Arab League, bypassing the Congress. Libya has become a breeding ground of Islamist terrorism because America's mission was ill-defined and its withdrawal premature.Nor did Mrs. Clinton resign on principle when Mr. Obama prematurely withdrew from Iraq, failing to negotiate a status of forces agreement that would have retained a sizable American presence--something the president could have achieved had he wanted it. On the contrary, Mrs. Clinton voiced no public objection to Mr. Obama's catastrophic decision precipitating Iraq's collapse, with ISIS and a revolutionary Iran filling the vacuum.Nor, despite her allegedly private misgivings, did Mrs. Clinton resign on principle or object publicly to Mr. Obama's bungling and vacillating policy toward a Syrian civil war that has metastasized into a murderous, regional and sectarian civil war and a humanitarian refugee crisis wreaking havoc not just the region but also in Europe and the U.S.The pivot to Asia that then-Secretary of State Clinton unveiled in 2011 has also proved hollow. Like Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton has de-emphasized the gathering danger of China's swelling ambitions, defined combating climate change as the priority, and emphasized diplomacy rather than American hard power. The combination of China's military buildup and America's precipitous build-down that Mrs. Clinton backed has increased the apprehension of traditional democratic allies in East Asia as well as India.A vote for Hillary Clinton is therefore a vote for Mr. Obama's dangerous doctrine, which fears American power more than it fears our enemies. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton contributed enormously to lowering the barriers to aggression everywhere--with much worse to come unless we reverse course.The internationalist conservatives who oppose Mr. Trump on foreign-policy grounds have a point. But they shouldn't fool themselves that they will get something better with Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Kaufman, a professor of public policy at Pepperdine University, is the author of ""Dangerous Doctrine: How Obama's Grand Strategy Weakened America"" (University Press of Kentucky, 2016).Credit: By Robert G.

"Election 2016: Clinton Holds Advantage in Latest Poll --- Democrat is ahead of Trump by 5 points, but lead shrinks as field of candidates widens",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799524940?accountid=12768,"After a tumultuous few weeks in the presidential campaign, Democrat Hillary Clinton's lead over Republican rival Donald Trump stands at 5 percentage points, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, but the race is essentially tied when third-party candidates are included.The latest survey, of 1,000 registered voters, shows Mrs. Clinton gets 46% support, to 41% for Mr. Trump, in a head-to-head matchup. The presumptive Democratic nominee's number has held steady over the past month, while Mr. Trump's standing dropped by 2 points since May.The survey was conducted June 19-23, a period in which Mr. Trump fired his campaign manager and faced criticism from within his own party over weak fundraising numbers and lack of organization. Earlier in the month, he was the target of bipartisan ire for his focus on a federal judge's ethnicity and his reaction to the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla.That Mr. Trump's gap with his rival grew by just 2 points after enduring the rockiest phase of his campaign so far is a sign that perceptions of the candidates are hardening, the pollsters said.""Donald Trump has had the worst month one can imagine, but Clinton's negatives are so high the net impact on the ballot is almost invisible,"" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Democratic pollster Fred Yang.Mrs. Clinton's lead fell to 1 point, at 39% to Mr. Trump's 38%, when Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are part of the mix. With both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton saddled with low approval ratings, voters seem to be looking for alternatives. Together, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein were the choice of 16% of those who took part in the survey.A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said the Libertarian ticket expects to be on the ballot in all 50 states. A Green Party spokesman said the party expects to do at least as well as 2012, when Ms. Stein was on the ballot in 37 states.Mrs. Clinton commanded the support of 78% of those surveyed who backed her rival in the Democratic primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. She and other Democratic allies are trying to get that number to grow by unifying the party coming off an unexpectedly competitive primary race.One holdout for now is Mr. Sanders himself. Though he said he would vote for Mrs. Clinton, he has withheld his endorsement. Last week, his campaign complained that Clinton allies on a Democratic platform drafting committee didn't take a harder stance against a Pacific free-trade pact that President Barack Obama is pushing.Mrs. Clinton has held a steady lead in national polling for well over a month, but there have been some signs of tightness in battleground states. A series of polls last week from Quinnipiac University, for instance, found Mr. Clinton commanding a large lead, 47% to 39%, in Florida, but running basically even with Mr. Trump in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Democratic candidates since 1992 have held a distinct edge in the Electoral College, and a win in Florida for Mrs. Clinton would make a victory for Mr. Trump all the harder.With the general election in the early stages, voters are deeply divided about the two top candidates. Men and women, whites and minorities, city dwellers and rural voters see Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in starkly different terms.The survey showed a distinct gender split. Mrs. Clinton enjoys a 17-point lead among women, while Mr. Trump has a 10-point advantage among men.The Clinton campaign has sought to capitalize on what it sees as Mr. Trump's vulnerability among women voters. After Mr. Trump accused Mrs. Clinton of playing the ""woman card"" in April, Mrs. Clinton's campaign launched a fundraising appeal, inviting supporters to purchase their very own pink ""woman card"" suitable for display on refrigerator doors.Mrs. Clinton's strength is deepest in the cities. She led Mr. Trump by nearly 30 points in urban areas, while Mr. Trump was ahead by about the same margin in rural parts of the country.The split along racial lines is especially pronounced. Mr. Trump was the choice of only 22% of Hispanic voters, meaning he is running behind the previous Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, who captured 27% of the Hispanic vote in losing to Mr. Obama in 2012.Mr. Trump has made immigration a focus of his campaign. He has vowed to build a wall on the southern border to prevent illegal immigration. More recently, he has said the federal judge presiding over lawsuits surrounding Trump University has a conflict of interest because of his heritage. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants.Mrs. Clinton's support among Hispanics stood at 69%.Overall, Mr. Trump led 49% to 37% among white voters, while Mrs. Clinton led 73% to 16% among nonwhites.Credit: By Peter Nicholas",9/16/16
Trump and the Ghost of Barry Goldwater,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799524927?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has committed the Barry Goldwater mistake. In his 1964 speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination, Goldwater said that ""extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice"" and ""moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" His declaration sent two messages: Goldwater wouldn't seek to reconcile with his GOP opponents in the cause of party unity. And he was every bit the uncompromising conservative his critics had said he was.Mr. Trump, since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee after winning the Indiana primary on May 3, has sent pretty much the same message. Rather than concentrate on unifying the GOP, he has spent considerable time bashing Republicans who haven't endorsed him and even some who have. Though he would like to have party leaders on his side, Mr. Trump says he can win the White House without them.He also insists he won't change his wild-and-woolly campaign style, though it tends to buttress the idea, popular among Democrats and the media, that he's unfit to be president. It is one thing for Hillary Clinton to suggest that. But some Republicans agree and say so, usually privately but occasionally in public.Day after day last month, Mr. Trump attacked Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. The judge is biased because of his Mexican heritage, Mr. Trump charged. The case is unrelated to the campaign, but Mr. Trump acted as if it were a critical concern of voters. This diversion was harmful to his candidacy.House Speaker Paul Ryan said Mr. Trump's attacks on the judge were ""racist."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Mr. Trump wasn't acting like a ""serious"" presidential candidate. Both Republican leaders have endorsed Mr. Trump, but they remain wary. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's harangues prompted the conservative columnist George Will to change his voter registration from Republican to ""unaffiliated.""The fallout beyond the Beltway is tangible. In the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Mrs. Clinton's lead has improved to 46%-41%, up from 46%-43% in mid-May. Other polls show a much larger swing against Mr. Trump: 10 percentage points in the Rasmussen survey and 14 points in the ABC/Washington Post poll. The Real Clear Politics average now gives Mrs. Clinton a lead of 6.7 percentage points.Mr. Trump's behavior wasn't the sole cause. Mrs. Clinton also benefited from finishing off her Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Yet almost single-handedly Mr. Trump has resurrected the #NeverTrump movement. Its effort to cajole a prominent Republican to run as an independent conservative, chiefly to keep Mr. Trump out of the White House, had faltered. In its place, a plan to deny him the nomination at the Republican convention in July is being scoped out.Should a convention challenge prove threatening, Mr. Trump may be short on allies. Mr. Ryan says he won't try to advise Republicans how to vote. Nor will Mr. Trump's final two rivals for the nomination, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, be any help. They haven't endorsed Mr. Trump and are more likely to undercut him than help him. For all these troubles, Mr. Trump has himself alone to blame.His mistakes, however, aren't necessarily fatal. Goldwater would have lost to President Johnson in 1964 regardless of what he said at the GOP convention. But Mr. Trump has a chance to change his ways and win. Indeed, he has already started changing.Normally Mr. Trump gives few set-piece speeches with a prepared text and teleprompter. But he did last week with a powerful attack on Mrs. Clinton. The speech was well written and he followed it word for word with rare discipline. He didn't ad lib, make faces or boast. It was the best speech of his yearlong campaign. The most stinging line was cribbed from Newt Gingrich: ""Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States.""The favorable reception should have signaled to Mr. Trump that going after Mrs. Clinton makes more sense than taking digs at Republicans. Dread of a Clinton presidency unites the GOP. Besides last week's speech, Mr. Trump has done little to capitalize on that -- except give her a nickname. Not since Goldwater has a nominee done as poor a job of bringing the party together.Anyone who has read ""The Art of the Deal"" knows how proactive Mr. Trump was as a businessman and developer. Yet he has been anything but proactive in drawing unwilling Republicans and conservatives into his camp. He seems to think they're obligated to support him.He should know better. Those Republicans who are uneasy with Mr. Trump are no more likely to back him automatically than were great business deals to drop in his lap unbidden. Pursuing, wooing and inspiring holdouts is required. Mr. Trump has prospered, politically speaking, by ignoring the rules, but this one is worth respecting.To underscore his desire for unity, Mr. Trump ought to apologize to the Bush family. He has been mean to George H.W. and Jeb, but especially to George W. Bush, whom he said ""lied"" about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq to justify the American invasion. This was untrue. Correcting the false charge would be an act of decency by Mr. Trump.If no unlikely convention coup materializes, Mr. Trump's speech accepting the nomination on July 21 will be a final opportunity to pull his party together. The question is whether the discipline and geniality he has lately displayed will endure until then. If so, Mr. Trump may be able to show, unlike Goldwater, that he isn't who detractors say he is.The day after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Mr. Trump happened to be in Scotland to open his new golf course at Turnberry. He was relaxed and good-natured and mentioned that he had thought Brexit would win. He didn't brag about his foresight. He seemed a changed man, at least for the moment. It was breezy and he must have felt the wind at his back.---Mr. Barnes, executive editor of the Weekly Standard, is a Fox News commentator.Credit: By Fred Barnes",9/16/16
Trump Adjusts Some of His Positions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800302559?accountid=12768,"In the two months since he , Donald Trump has blurred his positions on some key issues and tactics that helped him win more primary votes than any other GOP presidential candidate.Among his promises during the primary: ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims,"" a wall along the southern border, and the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants. He opposed increasing the minimum wage and favored tax cuts for the wealthy.His national-security policy now has shifted to . ""I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation,' he said recently on Twitter, referring to people living in the U.S. illegally. And last month, he said he was ""open"" to state-level minimum-wage hikes and ""flexible"" on the size of tax cuts for affluent households. He hasn't wavered on the wall.In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he was ""getting more specific,"" not changing positions.""I don't flip flop. I do what's right,"" he said. ""Sometimes there's something I think I have to adjust, but I don't do it for votes, I do it because I think it's right.""It isn't a full-fledged ""pivot"" to the general election that several Trump allies predicted would make him more acceptable to the political establishment, but more of a lean. That allows him to appeal to supporters energized by his hard-line primary stances while reaching out to voters who prefer a more nuanced candidate.""He's gone from severe rhetoric to staying pretty consistent but with a more thoughtful approach,"" said veteran Republican strategist Ed Rollins, who is working with a pro-Trump super PAC. ""It's getting to be a more structured campaign, but it's not like he's switching positions on abortion and gun control.""Mr. Trump's vacillations could open the door to attacks that he isn't so different from the politicians he pilloried for soliciting money from Wall Street and using teleprompters. He is now doing both.Still, his rhetoric at rallies remains as fiery as ever. ""I like it a lot,"" Mr. Trump said of waterboarding at a rally Tuesday in Ohio, where he also said he had ""shamed"" Democrat Hillary Clinton into reversing her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She now opposes that trade deal after having backed it when she was secretary of state, and since her 2008 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton has shifted positions on other issues, such as same-sex marriage, which she now supports.""If we hold Trump to the same standard as a career politician, we're always going to be disappointed because he hasn't spent a lifetime with his finger in the wind like Mrs. Clinton,"" said Michael Caputo, a former Trump staffer. ""It's the difference between pandering and figuring out where you stand.""But unlike Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton has released reams of policy papers on a wide range of topics. Her campaign website includes detailed overviews of her positions on 32 issues; Mr. Trump's site covers seven issues.Mrs. Clinton recently posted a link on Twitter to the issues section of her campaign site, adding a jab at Mr. Trump. ""I sweat the specifics because they matter,"" she wrote. ""If you're running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you're going to pay for it, and how you'll get it done.""Details of Mr. Trump's positions can be hard to pin down. For example, as he moves away from the temporary ban on Muslims and toward limiting immigration from certain countries, he has declined to pinpoint which regions of the world would be affected and how he would measure their record on terrorism.Mr. Trump's allies dismiss questions about such details, saying voters would be hard-pressed to name Mrs. Clinton's top priorities.""The most important thing to know about Donald Trump is that he knows how to drive a bulldozer and people want Washington leveled,"" said a former adviser, Barry Bennett, who worked for Mr. Trump's rival-turned-surrogate, Ben Carson. ""That's way more important to voters than whether Somalia is on the list of terror states.""Trump's tax policy is one of his most detailed, offering to push millions of taxpayers off the income-tax rolls and lower rates for businesses and individuals. It also promises significant tax cuts for all income groups while claiming not to widen budget deficits.An analysis by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation found that the plan would increase economic growth but reduce federal revenue by $10 trillion over a decade, even after assuming additional revenue spurred by that economic expansion.Mr. Trump landed in a several-day kerfuffle on his tax plan in May, when he said high-income taxpayers would pay more. That seemed to break with Republican orthodoxy, but he later clarified that they in his plan, once that plan was negotiated in Congress.Still, Mr. Trump has suggested he might alter the plan, and he has met with advisers to consider options. So far, he hasn't announced any changes.""I always believe in flexibility and remaining flexible,"" he said in a May interview. ""When you start negotiating the plan, there's always going to be give and take, but this is the proposal and it's been very well received.""People like Mr. Caputo who have known Mr. Trump for years and read his books say the real-estate mogul sees public policy not so differently than he views his private business: as a negotiation.In one sign that the campaign is seeking to improve Mr. Trump's messaging, it announced two major hires this week for its communication team: Jason Miller, who advised Trump rival Ted Cruz, and Michael Abboud, who used to work at the Republican National Committee.""If you operate from the premise that a candidate for office cannot advance their policy prescriptions, then you are stuck in the muck,"" Mr. Caputo said. ""I don't think Donald Trump is changing his mind. I think Donald Trump is finding his footing.""Richard Rubin contributed to this article.Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.comCredit: By Beth Reinhard",9/19/16
Trump Vows to Undo Trade Pacts,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1799978588?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to withdraw the U.S. from global trade alliances, saying he would exit the North American Free Trade Agreement if it isn't renegotiated, would label China a currency manipulator and would kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a Pacific Rim trade deal.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee's trade proposals amount to a wholesale rejection of longstanding Republican orthodoxy and leave the party with a candidate arguing against the very policies that most GOP leaders have enacted and supported. He spoke longingly about 18th century economic policy that funded the federal government largely on tariffs.""Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs--emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Yet today, 240 years after the revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down.""Within hours of Mr. Trump's remarks in Pennsylvania, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton offered a strikingly different economic view in an address on technology, saying she would aim to connect every U.S. home to high-speed internet and calling for expanding free Wi-Fi networks in public spaces. ""We need to get back into the future business, because that's who we are as Americans,"" she said in Denver.Mr. Trump's speech drew condemnation from both Democrats allied with Mrs. Clinton and Republicans who have long sought to boost U.S. trade. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent much of Mr. Trump's speech arguing against his views on its Twitter account, saying his approach would cost 3.5 million U.S. jobs and result in ""higher prices"" and ""a weaker economy.""Little of what Mr. Trump proposed came as a surprise to observers of the 2016 presidential campaign. From the beginning, the New Yorker has articulated nationalist policies on the economy, trade and immigration that have driven his appeal, particularly among working-class voters who have seen jobs disappear in an increasingly global economy.Some of his most specific criticism Tuesday was aimed at China. ""I am going to instruct my treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take advantage of the United States will be met with sharply,"" he said.Chinese officials regularly say they are letting markets play a bigger role in setting the yuan's value against the dollar. The International Monetary Fund has argued that the yuan no longer is undervalued.He also vowed ""to instruct the U.S. trade representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules,"" he said of the World Trade Organization.Mr. Trump didn't mention the most aggressive trade policies he touted during his primary campaign: a tariff of up to 45% on Chinese-made goods and stiff financial penalties on U.S. companies that move factory work to Mexico. But he did seek to tie his own brand of economic nationalism with the U.K.'s vote last week to leave the EU.""Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I was on the right side of that issue as you know--with the people. I said it was going to happen, I felt it, while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites. Both she and President Obama predicted that one and many others totally wrong.""Mr. Trump's protectionist trade proposals put him closer ideologically to recent Democratic presidential candidates than to Republicans, who in 2012 placed enacting the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the official GOP platform. Both Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton in 2008 said they would seek to renegotiate Nafta, though Mr. Obama didn't follow through while in office.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in his primary challenge of Mrs. Clinton, boasted that he had voted against Nafta and said he wasn't comfortable with any recent U.S. trade agreement. Mr. Sanders said he would reject the TPP, and Mrs. Clinton eventually agreed with him.Mr. Trump has previously lambasted Nafta, which was signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton but largely negotiated by his predecessor, Republican President George H.W. Bush.""I'm going tell our Nafta partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers,"" Mr. Trump said Tuesday, for the first time citing specific presidential authority to end the pact. ""If they do not agree to a renegotiation, then I will submit notice...that America intends to withdraw from the deal.""Mr. Obama is to meet with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts Wednesday in Ottawa at what has become known as the annual ""Three Amigos"" summit.Without specifically addressing Mr. Trump's trade speech, Mrs. Clinton, in her remarks, said her Republican opponent's signature slogan to ""make America great again"" amounts to ""code"" for rolling back inclusive policies.""Forget about technology, forget about inclusivity, forget about giving everybody an opportunity to have a real shot at the best possible future,"" Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Trump's proposals. ""Well, that is not who we are as Americans.

"Milton Friedman's Morals; As Trump and Clinton bang the drums for tariffs and renegotiated deals, where's the popular voice for trade?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1820924635?accountid=12768,"Whether it's Donald Trump complaining ""we don't win on trade"" or Hillary Clinton vowing to appoint a ""chief trade prosecutor,"" our two main candidates for president are both campaigning on the idea that government needs to protect us from any foreigner who would sell us something at a better price than we could get at home.Where's Milton Friedman when you need him?In 1980, the Nobel Prize-winning economist brought the message of free markets and free trade into the homes of ordinary Americans via an extraordinary public television series called ""Free to Choose."" He did so without apology, without a prepared script and in plain language--moral as well as practical--that you didn't have to be an economist to understand.He also did it against the prevailing mood that while free markets might be nice in theory, in reality what America needed was a healthy shot of protectionism: e.g., ""voluntary"" restrictions on Japanese cars, stronger anti-dumping statutes and greater enforcement of state ""buy American"" laws.Is it so much different today? In an age when the global economy has helped lift billions out of abject poverty and put in the pockets of our children iPhones with more processing power than the computers NASA used to put a man on the moon, trade has become a dirty word.The negatives of trade seemed to be confirmed by a now-famous 2012 graphic by economist Branko Milanovic, which plots how much real income has grown between 1988 and 2008 by income percentiles of the global population. Called the ""elephant chart"" because of its shape, it appears to prove the Trump-Clinton critique: that the winners from trade are foreigners and our top 1%, while the losers are the working and middle class in the developed West, including the U.S.But the London-based Resolution Foundation has now recrunched the numbers to adjust for factors including population growth and the collapse of the U.S.S.R. When it did, it found that though income growth for the U.S. working and middle classes was smaller than for their peers in other Western economies, it was not stagnant.In a recent Financial Times story, Resolution Foundation director Torsten Bell sounded a distinctly Friedmanite note: ""Although globalisation brings a range of challenges for lower income families, we need to be clear that weak income growth generally is rooted in domestic policy, and blaming globalisation takes the pressure off governments.""What might such pressure look like? Well, Harvard economist Edward Glaeser suggests we might, for example, consider the way well-intentioned government programs can boomerang by discouraging work--everything from minimum-wage hikes that make low-skilled young men more expensive to hire to the huge marginal tax rates that kick in when, say, a single mom using some government benefit gets a job.No one denies that Americans can lose jobs when an industry abroad is selling a good or service at a better price. But the high-employment, mass-manufacturing economy of the postwar years is not coming back no matter how high tariffs are or what we do to countries who manipulate their currencies. Even more interesting, the Resolution Foundation study reports average real income growth for lower- and middle-class workers in the U.K. was much higher than for their American counterparts, even though the U.K. has an economy that is more, not less, dependent on trade.For his part, Friedman would ask by what right should an American be prevented from buying a lawful good or service if he found a better price from someone overseas? Where's the morality of keeping a worker from selling the product of his labor to someone who happens to live in another country? And the following was Friedman's response on ""Free to Choose"" when a union official challenged him on his bid to eliminate all tariffs over five years:""The social and moral issues are all on the side of free trade. And it is you, and people like you, who introduce protection who are the ones who are violating fundamental moral and social issues.""Tell me, what trade union represents the workers who are displaced because high tariffs reduce exports from this country, because high tariffs make steel and other goods more expensive, and as a result, those industries that use steel have to charge higher prices, they have fewer employees, the export industries that would grow up to balance the imports, tell me what union represents them? What moral and ethical view do you have about their interests?""It's still a good question. Because here we are, seven weeks out from an election in which the Republican and the Democratic nominee are trying to outdo each other in their opposition to trade. And neither appreciates the irony that the very definition of a bad trade deal is one that inserts the heavy hand of government between a voluntary exchange that leaves both Citizen of Country A and Citizen of Country B better off.Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.Credit: By William McGurn",9/20/16
"Trump Is Tested in the West --- Colorado poses hurdles for the Republican, but there are signs of thaw with the state GOP",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800557530?accountid=12768,"DENVER--If there is a presidential battleground state that encompasses all of Donald Trump's challenges, it's Colorado.The Republican candidate hasn't campaigned here, aside from touching down for a debate last year in Boulder. He hired a state director only this week, two months after Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton began building her team. He didn't win any delegates at the state's spring Republican convention.What's more, Colorado hosts one of the nation's largest Hispanic populations, a group that national polls show are resistant to Mr. Trump's candidacy. A few blocks from where the businessman is scheduled to speak Friday, liberal groups are planning to erect a 9-by-30-foot, temporary barrier to protest his proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico.""I would not call Colorado unfriendly territory. I'd call it unknown territory,"" said Republican consultant Patrick Davis, Mr. Trump's new state director.Mr. Trump is undaunted. ""I think I'm going to be great in Colorado,"" he said in an interview this week.Despite all his hurdles, a recent CBS News/YouGov poll found Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton essentially tied in the state, which is likely among a dozen of the most competitive in November. President Barack Obama carried Colorado twice after the state for years mostly favored the Republican nominee.Mrs. Clinton and her allies have invested almost $3 million in advertising in Colorado, according to SMG Delta/NBC News, while Mr. Trump hasn't spent any money. Mr. Davis noted that Mrs. Clinton's primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders, beat her at the Democratic state party convention, ""so she has work to do here as well.""Mr. Trump has had a strained relationship with the state's GOP since April, when Sen. Ted Cruz outmaneuvered him at party meetings to the Cleveland convention. Some of those delegates are threatening to oppose the GOP presumptive nominee at the convention this month.""The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!"" Mr. Trump posted on Twitter in April.The state's Republican U.S. senator, Cory Gardner, dismissed Mr. Trump's complaint as a ""temper tantrum"" on Twitter. A spokesman for the senator, who backed Mr. Cruz after Florida Sen. Marco Rubio dropped out of the race, didn't respond to requests for his current view of Mr. Trump's campaign.""What we've seen from most of our members of Congress are statements saying they will support the Republican nominee,"" Mr. Davis said. ""That's fine, but if we are going to win here, we have got to be unified.""There are signs the Colorado GOP is warming to Mr. Trump. Three of the most prominent Republicans--beer executive Pete Coors, former Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan and Larry Mizell, a major party donor--are co-hosting a fundraiser for Mr. Trump on Friday. One of Mr. Cruz's delegates is organizing a pro-Trump rally Friday at the state capitol.Still, the region has proved difficult for Mr. Trump, who also lost contests in Idaho, Wyoming and Utah.""This is the Mountain West, which was not a strong area for him in the primary so he's got to come in here and convince people he will support the kind of lifestyle they want to live,"" said Colorado Republican Party chairman Steve House, noting his voters are ""conservative, free-thinking, outdoors-sort-of-people but also very evangelical. Donald Trump doesn't really represent that demographic.""That is a more natural fit for 2012 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who is slated to introduce Mr. Trump on Friday at the Western Conservative Summit, billed as the largest gathering of conservative activists outside of Washington, D.C. The lineup of speakers includes Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, an who refuses to get behind the presumptive nominee.Republican congressional candidate George Athanasopoulos, who is seeking to oust a Democrat representing the Denver suburbs, was a Cruz supporter who switched to Mr. Trump in June.""There is a strong anti-Trump movement among conservatives in Colorado, and if we have any chance of winning in November, we absolutely must unite,"" he said.He added, however, that he has some concerns about running in November with Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket. ""I don't know how the electorate will receive someone who is such an unconventional politician,"" he said. ""If Trump wins I will win. If Hillary Clinton wins, my opponent will win,"" Mr. Athanasopoulos said.Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.comCredit: By Beth Reinhard",9/20/16
Donald Trump's Tariff Party,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800287601?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump offered some promising thoughts on taxes, regulation and energy in a speech on Tuesday--too bad they were made in passing, near the end, almost as an afterthought. Most of what his campaign billed as his signature economic message was the most detailed assault on trade by a presidential candidate since--well, we can't remember. Mr. Trump wants to make Republicans into the Tariff Party.""Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs--emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production. Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down,"" Mr. Trump said in remarks outside Pittsburgh.He added that if China, Mexico, Canada and others don't bend to his demands and rewrite our trade agreements, he will ""use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962."" So much for the idea that Mr. Trump would modify his antitrade views for the general election.Instead he's escalating, as he bids for Bernie Sanders voters and electoral votes in the industrial Midwest. Perhaps he figures swing states with large Hispanic populations like Florida and Colorado are already lost. So he's doubling down on a strategy to win white working-class voters who have been told for years by Democrats that trade is to blame for their declining economic fortunes. We'll find out soon enough if this works politically, but as economics it's nonsense.***Start with his idea that tariffs are good for economic growth. A tariff is a tax levied at the national border. A tariff raises the cost of imports, which reduces the standard of living of consumers who buy finished goods or businesses that buy inputs for their products.If a domestic producer can replace the import at the same cost, the harm is minimal. But if that were true, there usually would be no demand for the import. Mr. Trump understands this in his own business, which is why he farms out production of his ties, scarves and other branded Trump products to China.The same logic applies to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump calls ""the worst trade deal in history."" He cites as an authority the Economic Policy Institute, the AFL-CIO's think tank, but that's like asking Sid Blumenthal if Hillary Clinton is trustworthy. Most economists understand that free trade with Mexico and Canada has been a historic success.Nafta took effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and the American economy boomed for the rest of that decade. The U.S. jobless rate fell to 3.8% in April 2000. Nafta helped Mexico recover faster from one of its familiar peso crises in late 1994, and today our southern neighbor is providing more jobs at home for workers who once would have illegally crossed the U.S. border.Nafta has also helped U.S. industry stay globally competitive. Many companies have moved plants to Mexico, but they often supply parts for U.S. finished goods. An April 2015 Congressional Research Service study credits Nafta ""with helping U.S. manufacturing industries, especially the U.S. auto industry, become more globally competitive through the development of supply chains."" By moving some low-wage jobs to Mexico, car makers have been able to maintain U.S. production.If Mr. Trump imposed a tariff on Mexico now, he'd in effect be taxing American exports. The same CRS study cites evidence that ""40% of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico and 25% of the content of U.S. imports from Canada are of U.S. origin.""Mr. Trump also cites Ronald Reagan's tariffs on motorcycles and semiconductors. But the Gipper was a committed free trader who applied narrow tariffs only rarely and reluctantly. His tariff on memory chips was a particular fiasco that damaged American computer makers. The U.S. semiconductor industry was saved by innovation that moved to higher-value microprocessors.Most preposterous is Mr. Trump's claim that trade protection is a declaration of ""independence from elites"" in Washington. Trade favoritism is the epitome of crony capitalism that benefits those with the best political connections. Mr. Trump's tariffs would be the crony equivalent of President Obama's subsidies for Al Gore's green-energy investments. The only difference is who benefits.***Americans are frustrated by slow economic and wage growth, but the first obligation of political leaders is not to deceive them with false remedies. Mr. Trump's tariff remedy would face furious foreign opposition, and it would probably end in tears if he imposed it.As for the election campaign, Mr. Trump's protectionism contradicts his promise of economic revival. He'll have a better chance of winning the economic debate if he focuses on the taxes, regulations and monetary policy that are the real cause of our economic malaise.",9/20/16
Politics & Ideas: Hard Truths for Trump's America,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1819079713?accountid=12768,"If there is a ""war on coal,"" as Donald Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell allege, it has been under way for a very long time. In Mr. McConnell's home state of Kentucky, coal mine employment peaked at 75,633 in 1948. It fell by two-thirds to about 25,000 in the late 1960s, before doubling to more than 50,000 in the late 1970s. It has since fallen virtually without interruption and now stands at 6,465.Much the same is true for West Virginia, the epicenter of Appalachian angst. The state's coal industry employed close to 120,000 workers in 1950. By the time John F. Kennedy campaigned against Hubert Humphrey in the state's 1960 primary, the total stood at less than 50,000. After a temporary recovery in the 1970s and another in the first decade of the current century, about 15,000 remain.Many forces have combined to decimate coal jobs since their mid-20th century peak. According to a 2014 official report from the state government of Kentucky, the principal culprit has been the ""automation and mechanization of mining processes, which have improved mining productivity."" Another factor is ""diminishing reserves of thick and easily accessible coal seams."" What remains is ""more difficult, labor-intensive, and costly to mine."" A 2012 report from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, a think tank in Charleston, W.Va., offers much the same account.As a result, coal faces intensified competitive pressure from natural gas produced through hydraulic fracturing. The U.S. Energy and Information Administration expects this to persist over the next decade.Both state reports also cite an additional factor: recent federal regulations of greenhouse gases and mercury. But neither regards these policies as a primary cause of coal's decline. That argument would be absurd on its face, because nearly all the reduction in mining employment occurred before the federal government even began trying to reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuels.It is irresponsible for politicians to suggest that these mining jobs will return; they can't and won't. And even if mining recovered modestly, it would make at best a small contribution to coal states' economies. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, mining and logging now account for only 3% of West Virginia's total employment and less than 1% of Kentucky's. Coal is less an economic development issue than a potent symbol in the partisan culture war. The future lies elsewhere.Real economic recovery in Appalachia -- the heart of Red America -- requires facing some hard truths. As of 2015, according to the Census Bureau, West Virginia had the fourth-lowest median household income in the country, and Kentucky the second-lowest. Although neither state is a hub for high-wage jobs, the real problem is that so few of their denizens do any work at all. West Virginia has the lowest labor-force participation rate of any state in the country, 53%, and Kentucky the seventh-lowest, 58.5%. Although older than average populations are a contributing factor, that isn't the big story: Among prime working-age adults, age 25 to 54, West Virginia ranks dead last, Kentucky next to last.Here again, we are dealing with longstanding, deeply entrenched forces. The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy reports that the state's labor-force participation has ranked last every year since 1976, consistently lagging the national average by at least 9 percentage points. Low levels of educational attainment help explain this gap, as does poor health. West Virginians are twice as likely as the average American to receive federal disability payments. Indeed, the share of the state's adult population dependent on Social Security Disability Insurance is the highest in the country. (Kentucky ranks fourth.)J.D. Vance, the author of the surprise best-seller ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" writes about running into a hometown acquaintance who said he had quit his job because he was ""sick of waking up early."" Mr. Vance subsequently saw him complaining on Facebook about the ""Obama economy."" This man, he comments, is not a victim: His situation is ""directly attributable to the choices he's made."" But nothing in his environment forces him to look in the mirror and ask tough questions about himself. On the contrary, Mr. Vance insists: ""There is a cultural movement in the white working class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains adherents by the day.""The author of ""Hillbilly Elegy"" is a self-described conservative, but he criticizes his fellow conservatives for failing to tell their constituents the truth. Instead, the message of the right, Mr. Vance says, is: ""It's not your fault that you're a loser; it's the government's fault.""For decades conservatives have castigated liberals for abandoning the language of personal responsibility and turning their constituents into helpless victims. Now, led by Donald Trump, populist conservatives are doing just that.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Feds Winning Their War on Coal, at a Cost"" -- WSJ September 21, 2016)Credit: By William A.

Trump Decries 'Rigged System',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800900699?accountid=12768,"DENVER--In his first visit to the battleground state of Colorado since an October debate, Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump on Friday continued to lash out at the ""rigged system"" he says deprived him of the state's convention delegates.Though he essentially clinched the nomination two months ago, Mr. Trump spent much of his speech to thousands of conservative activists reviving grudges from the primary season.Colorado was among a handful of states that held party-run meetings to award delegates instead of statewide primaries. Mr. Trump was outmaneuvered by former rival Ted Cruz, who swept all of the state's delegates in April.Mr. Trump also pointed to Louisiana, where he won the most primary votes but came away with fewer delegates than Mr. Cruz.""I learned so much during the primaries,"" said Mr. Trump, three weeks before he's expected to accept his party's nomination in Cleveland. ""That's when I realized it's rigged, people, it's rigged.""Mr. Trump's rallying cry--applied to the political system he ran in as well as the wider economy--helped him win more votes than any other Republican presidential candidate in history, as many Americans feel trampled by politicians and Wall Street and other special interests.But Mr. Trump's continued rehashing of the primary in his speech at the Western Conservative Summit distracted from his attacks on Democrat Hillary Clinton and the other major themes of his campaign.""Mr. Trump needs to focus on Hillary Clinton, not Ted Cruz,"" said U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, a Cruz supporter who says he will back Mr. Trump as the nominee. ""That's not how you go about mending fences.""Mr. Trump is also under pressure to build the massive infrastructure and fundraising network demanded for a general election matchup against Mrs. Clinton. He just hired a state director in this crucial battleground state this week, two months after Mrs. Clinton began building a team here.A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton essentially tied in the state.""We do have to win Colorado,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I'll be back a lot, don't worry about it.""Mr. Trump said the U.S. is being ""destroyed"" by free trade and illegal immigration, which he blamed for ""unbelievable crime pouring in."" Countries are ""ripping us off"" by depending on the U.S. for military protection.""You're going to see job loss like we've never seen before if I don't win,"" he said.Mr. Trump also quipped that it was ""just a coincidence"" that former President Bill Clinton recently met with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, amid the FBI's scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server.""It's a very serious thing to have a thing like that happen. So sad,"" said Mr. Trump.Ms. Lynch said this week that she and Mr. Clinton didn't discuss the email matter.""When it comes to Mr. Trump, he's always going to say what's on his mind,"" said state Sen. Tim Neville, who represents part of Denver. ""When he talks about the level of cronyism in this country, that's huge.""Mr. Trump boasted about vanquishing more than a dozen rivals during the primary despite his lack of political experience, and he threw a punch at those who have declined to endorse him.""They were really nasty to me, and I was really nasty to them, and some of them just can't understand the importance of a victory for the Republicans,"" he said.Mr. Trump was preceded on stage by former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, one of the earliest backers of Mr. Trump.Like Mr. Trump, the former governor of Alaska faced resistance from GOP elders and said she had a name for the Republicans who refuse to get behind Mr. Trump.""I just call them Republicans Against Trump, or RAT for short,"" she said.Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.comCredit: By Beth Reinhard",9/21/16

Trump's Would Be No Ordinary Defeat,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1800890037?accountid=12768,"Before they gather in Cleveland for their convention, it's not too soon for Republicans to begin thinking about what exactly a Donald Trump defeat might be like.As with his now-documented habit of charitable promises that seldom materialize, Mr. Trump never intended to endanger a sizable part of his personal wealth to fund a presidential campaign. That means he'll continue to campaign on the cheap, by saying incendiary things and having them transmitted by the free media. Expect more speeches like the protectionist-cum-conspiracy theory speeches in suburban Pittsburgh on Tuesday and New Hampshire on Thursday, even if such diatribes frighten major donors and mainstream Republicans and make life harder for down-ticket Republican candidates in the fall.In his mind, Mr. Trump may still envision a populist prairie fire carrying him to the White House. This is not his best plan to win, he may also admit to himself, but the one he's willing to pay for.Here resides the problem all along for those hoping for a Trump-to-the-middle move. Such moves are expensive. Base-broadening campaigns require lots of paid TV to reach non-engaged voters and Trump skeptics, pummeling them with reassuring images suggesting that a Trump presidency would be OK.Mr. Trump not only is unwilling or unable to finance such a campaign. He evidently is unwilling to do what's necessary to entice GOP donors to finance it on his behalf. This means GOP officeholders seeking re-election can expect a constant headwind of inflammatory Trump statements designed to stimulate the free media coverage that his asset-lite campaign requires. Republican candidates up and down the ballot therefore become unwilling sharers of a high-risk Trump electoral wager, a gamble more likely to end in a Hillary landslide than a Trump White House.The more intriguing question concerns what happens if Mr. Trump decides he can't win and no longer is willing to throw good money after bad. Unless they were born on a turnip truck yesterday, campaign vendors will be the first to figure it out. Look for them quickly to cut off services rather than get stiffed in the inevitable Trump campaign bankruptcy filing.Mr. Trump's harsher Republican critics are kidding themselves to think Mr. Trump is crazy or unstable and will suffer a breakdown. More likely, he will simply and coldbloodedly toss the ball to the GOP, saying, in effect, ""If you want to pay for some events or TV, I'm available. Otherwise I'm done."" The GOP would then have to shoulder the dual burden of propping up a minimally respectable Trump campaign while also distancing its down-ballot candidates from Mr. Trump so they might survive.And that's the optimistic scenario. Mr. Trump has learned the value of audacity. He might well decide to cover his retreat and preserve his amour propre with a flurry of lawsuits and conspiracy theories about a ""rigged"" election.He's already begun putting narrative flesh on these bones. He speaks of ""crooked Hillary"" and increasingly of the Clinton Global Initiative, Bill Clinton's philanthropy, and what he calls the Clintons' ""politics of personal profit and theft."" In his trade speeches, he portrays the Clintons as members of a nefarious global elite that has enriched itself while foisting impoverishing trade deals on the U.S. middle class.He perhaps will throw in a few suggestions that foreign governments hold hidden leverage over Hillary because of her hacked, illegal email server. He'll mention Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich.Republicans can also expect to be a target of his accusations. He doesn't need to be plausible, just tell a story that justifies his own stance that he didn't lose, the other side cheated, ""Washington elites"" conspired against him, etc.If the Trump endgame is destined to go this way, Republicans should hope it does so early, ideally before the convention is even over. To date, Mr. Trump continues to tease top GOPers and conservatives with the idea that he may yet come their way, turn his formidable talents to advancing conservative causes. This merciless exploiting of Republican romantics has begun to seem like something out of ""The Blue Angel"" or Lucy with the football.Republicans need a strategy, and lots of money to fund it, to preserve their House and Senate majorities. Do they know it? The thing they should fear most: An autumn dynamic in which Mr. Trump believes the best outcome for him personally is one that does as much damage as possible to the long-run GOP cause.Credit: By Holman W.

REVIEW --- Talk Show --- The much-anticipated face-off between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will just be a TV spectacle; Real debate takes place in the course of governing (or at least it used to),http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1822602470?accountid=12768,"The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is only days away. What can we hope for? A revealing gaffe, a zinger that hits home, a flash of true spontaneity or a glimpse of the real character of the candidates -- these seem to be the most anyone is hoping for, and more than we are likely to get.Debates, at their very best, are the diamonds of democratic politics -- crystal clear in argument, sparkling with wit, free from the discolorations of petty self-interest and shaped to focus light on the great issues of the day.

Nor does the fault lie mainly in the quality of the questions or the skill of the moderator. The forum itself is flawed. How many ways are there to say, ""Vote for me""? That line will always be more advertisement than argument.The first televised presidential debate, starring John Kennedy and Richard Nixon, aired 56 years ago on Sept. 26, 1960. People who listened on the radio thought Nixon won, but those who watched on TV thought Kennedy won, and the election was so close that the TV factor might have made a difference. But should it have? Did viewers learn something from the grainy, flickering black and white images on their tiny TVs that was really relevant to the question of which policy or person was best for the country?The Kennedy-Nixon debate garnered mixed reviews, including severe criticism from establishment figures. The journalist Edward R. Murrow called it ""a puny contribution, capsuled, homogenized, perhaps dangerous in its future implication."" The historian Henry Steele Commager responded with an essay entitled, ""Washington Would Have Lost a TV Debate."" ""The present formula of TV debate,"" he remarked, ""is designed to corrupt the public judgment and, eventually, the whole political process. The American Presidency is too great an office to be subjected to the indignity of this technique."" Though the televised debates returned and eventually became a regular part of the campaign, it is hard to think of even one that stands out as a model of informed and informative discourse.During most campaign cycles, someone will write an essay comparing the disappointing pettiness of modern debates to the great Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, a series of daylong exchanges in various towns around Illinois during the contest between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas for a Senate seat. (Lincoln lost.) Whereas in modern televised debates, a candidate often has just 90 seconds for an answer, those debates gave each speaker 90 minutes for a single response. Audiences stood all day in the late summer sun to listen to intricate arguments about matters of national importance, such as the extension of slavery into the western territories. Our attention spans on the couch at home don't compare very well.But even the Lincoln-Douglas debates left a lot to be desired. They brought out vices in both candidates: Lincoln spun out an elaborate conspiracy theory about the spread of slavery, Douglas moralized self-righteously, and both pandered energetically to the crowds. The architecture of some of Lincoln's greatest thoughts is visible in his remarks, but he also stooped low, assuring a crowd in Charleston, Ill., in the part of the state closer to the South, that he did not believe that African-Americans should be ""voters or jurors"" or ""intermarry with white people."" As for Douglas, his case for ""popular sovereignty"" in each state merely dressed up the extension of slavery into the territories as a matter of principle.Traditionalists at the time reacted to these debates in much the same way that Murrow and Commager later responded to the Kennedy-Nixon debate -- as a scandal and an affront to the dignity of our institutions. ""The spirit of the Constitution is being violated in Illinois,"" wrote the editors of the Union, a Washington, D.C. newspaper. In those days, state legislatures, not the people at large, were responsible for electing senators, and the point of that arrangement, the Union reminded its readers, was to ""place the selection of a Senator beyond the reach of the maddening issues of the hour."" ""The whole country,"" the paper wrote, ""is disgusted with the scene"" in Illinois.From that traditional perspective, the proper setting for political debate was thought to be the institutions of government themselves, not the campaign trail. Legislatures and parliamentary assemblies had evolved over centuries to encourage substantive discussion of concrete policy choices and to reduce the danger of demagoguery.Lincoln's own favorite political oratory came not from campaign stumping but from congressional debate. He loved Daniel Webster's famous ""Second Reply to Hayne,"" which was delivered on the floor of the Senate in 1830. Sparked by a proposal to limit the sale of federal lands in the western territories, the debate quickly turned into an impassioned discussion of whether the national government was a creature of the states or a direct creation of the whole American people.Sen. Robert Hayne of South Carolina made the case for the priority and independence of the states. Daniel Webster, young but poised and a polished speaker, put forward a vision of a great nation united by modernized roads and infrastructure and fortified by New England's manufacturers. Protecting that manufacturing sector with high tariffs on imports from Europe was one of Webster's immediate goals, but the debate explored how this policy would affect various parts of the country and linked the issue with questions of sectional politics, national strategy and constitutional principle. Webster helped Americans to imagine the nation that Lincoln would eventually fight to preserve.Admirers of the Webster-Hayne debate often praise its most famous lines, such as Webster's memorable peroration. Hayne had worried that national unity would threaten the states' liberty. Webster's final line was a succinct answer: ""Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.""But one turn of phrase -- a tweet, basically -- cannot capture what was special about Webster's speech, or about Hayne's. The real strength of the debate lay in the power and clarity with which both sides elaborated the complex arguments behind their different positions, allowing listeners to enter into each point of view and understand it from the inside. John Quincy Adams, the former president, wrote to Martin Van Buren that the debate was ""the most important one that has taken place since the existence of the government. The two doctrines are now before the nation.""Webster's contribution has often been compared with that of Edmund Burke in England about 50 years earlier. Burke's speeches in Parliament, like Webster's in the Senate, became models of eloquence for generations of aspiring politicians and students. Like Webster, Burke did his best work in the context of particular legislative debates. He defended the desire for independence of the American colonists, pleaded for humane treatment of his native Ireland, predicted the worst excesses of the French Revolution, and excoriated the East India Company and colonial managers for their corrupt administration of India.If Webster's reply to Hayne offers an example of how to debate protectionism with more depth than we have heard lately, Burke's speech in support of the India Bill of Charles James Fox in 1783 offers an example of how to debate the proper oversight of large corporations. Burke argued that the East India Company had violated the terms of its corporate charter and should be made to cede control over its operations in India to two commissions appointed by Parliament. He thus urged regulation of a company that had enjoyed nearly unlimited autonomy in its operations abroad.The moral and psychological subtlety of Burke's case for reigning in that particular corporate excess dwarfs anything in our own public discourse. Instead of resorting to populist commonplaces, Burke explored the corrupting effects that working for the company in India was having on Britain's best and brightest. Young men arrived in India and were promptly given vast political and economic power with little oversight. They drank ""the intoxicating draught of authority and dominion before their heads are able to bear it,"" and then, Burke warned, they brought their newly acquired habits of imperial brutality back to England with them. These men, Burke told the House of Commons, ""marry into your families; they enter into your senate."" His arguments carried the chamber but could not overcome the king's influence in the House of Lords. He and his party ultimately lost the debate, but his speech remains an example of what debate can be.If we are looking for exemplary debates, we should also look behind Burke and Webster to the classical models they would have studied in school -- above all, Demosthenes and Cicero. These were the great orators, respectively, of democratic Athens and republican Rome. Plutarch had paired them in his ""Parallel Lives,"" which was an obligatory part of a liberal education. Burke's long campaign to impeach Warren Hastings for his corrupt management of India owed much to Cicero's first speech in 70 B.C. against Verres, a corrupt Roman governor of Sicily.As for Demosthenes, his speeches warning the Athenians of the growing strength of Philip II of Macedon in the fourth century B.C. had a furious, anxious power that comes across even today and even in translation. Simple in style, with little rhetorical ornament, Demosthenes' sentences concentrated the force of his mind into a few words, as a good punch concentrates the body's force into the inch between two knuckles. He was not running for office; he was pressing his fellow lawmakers to act.Examples like these remind us that public debate at its best is a part of governing, not of campaigning. Webster and Burke, Cicero and Demosthenes -- all spoke in deliberative assemblies to a specific group of their fellow citizens who were empowered to decide together a particular law or course of action.Their speeches were transcribed and published beyond the confines of the chamber to a much wider audience, but that was secondary; the immediate goal was to govern. The heyday of political debate in the U.S. lasted from the founding era through much of the 19th century, when arguments on the floor of legislatures directly informed decisions on policy. These deliberative institutions, whether local or national, focused debaters on particular questions and limited the audience they were addressing. Such settings imparted a natural discipline to the speeches given within them, encouraging substance.Today public deliberation hardly ever takes place in our legislative assemblies, though sometimes a pretense is staged for the cameras. In the U.S., we have been at war in one theater or another for 15 years, and yet Congress has not had a sustained debate about these conflicts since the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the U.K. last spring, leaders declined to follow a centuries-old tradition of parliamentary debate and responsibility when making the most consequential choice of the country's recent history, to leave the European Union. They preferred to stage debates in the enormous and amorphous ""public sphere"" that the media creates and that individuals dip into and out of through their devices.In our own increasingly fractured public sphere, the Commission on Presidential Debates has announced that the second debate between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, on October 9, ""will take the form of a town meeting, in which half of the questions will be posed directly by citizen participants.""What exactly will these ""citizen participants"" participate in? They are offered roles in a television show. They will ask questions, as a reporter does, to help elicit responses that might inform the public. This can certainly be useful, but we should not let the language of ""town meetings"" and ""participation"" obscure the limitations of the forum. One thing that the staged presidential debates cannot offer is a reminder of what debating sounds like when it is actually a part of self-government.Years ago, when I lived in Williamstown, Mass., I attended a real town meeting to discuss the municipality's annual budget. Citizens did not pose questions; they made arguments. A youth program had been cut, and townspeople argued pro and con and then voted. The program was saved, with funds shifted from elsewhere. No one offered oratory for the ages, but it was a good debate, full of clear, forceful, responsible arguments. Demosthenes would have been proud.In the history of democratic societies, it was the intense pressures of governing together that occasionally compressed the sand of ordinary political speech into a gem or two of public oratory worth saving. We have mostly let public debate float free from the pressures of our governing institutions these days. We should not be surprised that we do not produce diamonds.---Mr. Garsten is professor of political science and the humanities at Yale University and the author of ""Saving Persuasion: A Defense of Rhetoric and Judgment.""Credit: By Bryan Garsten",9/24/16
"Incentives, the EITC and Helping the Poor; Michael Saltsman says Trump can better help the poor if he increases the EITC instead of raising the minimum wage.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1822502844?accountid=12768,"The effective wage rates for a couple with two dependent children, postulated by Michael Saltsman in ""Don't Raise the Minimum Wage: Trump Has a Better Plan "" (op-ed, Sept. 15), should be even higher because the wage supplements cited are exempt from payroll tax as well as federal and state income taxes. Further, they don't raise adjusted gross income into the range where Earned Income Tax Credit benefits would ramp down toward zero. So traditional families will love Donald Trump's plan.Single adults without children, however, will see no improvement. Although the federal tax code began to give them a meager EITC scale about 10 years ago, that won't change. This disparity raises the issue of ""equal pay for equal work"" (separately from gender or color) that doesn't arise in minimum-wage plans. Mr. Trump's plan won't appeal to singles unless he includes them.Barry J. MitchelPortsmouth, Va.To the extent that the EITC works to increase labor supply, it pushes down market wages. It is as simple as supply and demand. The more the EITC is expanded, the more market wages are suppressed and ironically, the more liberals can then complain about stagnant wages at the bottom end.The EITC is a $60 billion spending program. That money is taxed from other Americans, thus reducing their incentive to work.Chris EdwardsCato InstituteWashingtonMr. Saltsman correctly points out that this ""credit"" is a misnomer, calling it ""a wage supplement for low-income employees."" Essentially the EITC makes up the difference for the low-wage paying employers so that their employees have more take-home pay. Taxpayers end up covering the additional wage cost that the employer would otherwise pay in a higher wage. So if the EITC is another form of wage income, why is the FICA tax not applied? This shortchanges Social Security. Or is it that the government wants to cut the earned benefits of one entitlement so it can expand the unearned benefits of another?Steve WaldeRancho Santa Fe, Calif.",9/24/16
"In Debate, Readers Want to Hear About National Debt; Topic is No. 1 in Wall Street Journal survey ahead of Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump meeting",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1823241765?accountid=12768,"Confronting the nation's debt was the subject that readers of The Wall Street Journal most wanted the presidential candidates to address in Monday night's debate , according to a survey.Beginning Sunday, the Journal solicited readers' feedback online ahead of the first showdown between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Readers were shown 157 potential topics and asked to submit as many as five picks in their response. In all, readers submitted more than 1,400 responses to the survey as of Monday afternoon.Of the topics presented to readers, national debt was the top selection, receiving 363 votes. Tackling the debt has been a theme in presidential campaign for decades, and the next president will face the highest debt-to-GDP ratio since Harry Truman. That said, neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Trump has framed tackling the debt--now at more than $19 trillion--as a top issue.After national debt, Journal readers hoped to hear from the candidates about income tax, with 322 votes. According to plans released by the campaigns and statements by candidates, Mrs. Clinton's plan would raise taxes on high-income, high-wealth households, such as Mr. Trump. The Republican is promoting cuts for individuals and businesses, along with a repeal of the estate tax, which affects just 0.2% of estates each year, and new breaks for child care costs.The next two issues Journal readers were interested in hearing most at the debate also had an economic thread: the Affordable Care Act and the nation's economic growth.In fifth came ""Islamic terror,"" with climate change, infrastructure, corporate tax, entitlements and the budget deficit rounding out the top 10.On the flip side, some of the issues on the list that got the lowest amount of votes were Donald Trump's children, Cuba and both vice-presidential nominees--Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine on the Democratic ticket and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on the Republican one. Those two running mates will debate next week.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 34% of registered voters think the debates will be extremely or quite important in helping them decide whom to support for president.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.comRead More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com's home for Election 2016 news.* Live Coverage: First Presidential Debate* Jerry Seib: Wavering Voters Key to Race After Debate* Candidates Need to Emphasize the 'How' on Policy* How the Demographic Composition of the Electorate Could Prove DecisiveCredit: By Natalie Andrews",9/26/16

"Election 2016: Trump Stirs Up Capitol With His Visit --- Cruz warms to candidate, others remain icy after meetings on the Hill",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805654804?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, still working to secure the support of reluctant Republicans in Congress, reached a detente with his most formidable primary rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, but clashed with his critics during closed-door meetings Thursday.In the high point of his second visit this year to Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump won Mr. Cruz's commitment to speak at the GOP convention this month, a long-delayed rapprochement expected to help Mr. Trump win over his former opponent's conservative supporters.But the New York businessman continued to provoke other Republicans, showing little willingness to rein in the contentious statements that have caused heartburn in the party. The tensions were on display in a sharp exchange with Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) and in questions from concerned Republicans on immigration and other issues.Mr. Trump met with more than 215 House Republicans and many from the Senate in separate gatherings, followed by a private meeting with Mr. Cruz, according to a statement from the senator's office. It was the first meeting between the bitter rivals since the senator suspended his presidential campaign in May.Mr. Cruz didn't endorse Mr. Trump, but his willingness to speak at the convention is the clearest sign yet that the conservative lawmaker won't try to hinder Mr. Trump's campaign in the four months left until his showdown against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.The meeting seemed to mark the end of the animosity that had long flared between the Trump and Cruz campaigns. Before Mr. Cruz dropped out, Mr. Trump maligned him as ""Lyin' Ted"" and accused his father of being complicit in the John F. Kennedy assassination. In the last day of his campaign, Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump a ""pathological liar"" and a ""narcissist.""Mr. Cruz has made no secret of his desire to run for president again and has told people privately he believes 2016 is a repeat of 1976, when Ronald Reagan lost a nomination battle to Gerald Ford before taking the White House four years later.But even while Mr. Trump made peace with one of his former foes, he took on other lawmakers in meetings that turned combative at times. In one of the day's most confrontational exchanges, Mr. Trump chastised Mr. Flake for criticizing him publicly, saying that up until now he hadn't personally attacked Mr. Flake but could start to, according to accounts from Mr. Flake and other people familiar with the exchange.Mr. Flake, who has disavowed many of Mr. Trump's stances and hasn't endorsed him, told Mr. Trump he wanted to be able to support him, but found it hard amid the candidate's stream of incendiary comments, like those about the ""Mexican heritage"" of the Indiana-born federal judge overseeing the lawsuit against Trump University. Mr. Trump said the judge's lineage was a conflict due to Mr. Trump's pledge to seal the Mexican border.Mr. Flake referred to himself as the ""other senator from Arizona -- the one who wasn't captured,"" in a reference to fellow Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, which Mr. Trump has diminished.When Mr. Trump blamed the media for distorting his comments, Mr. Flake responded he was referring to direct quotes, the senator said.Mr. Trump did well in the GOP primary, but will have to secure much broader support to win in November, Mr. Flake said in an interview after the meeting. ""That's difficult to do when he seems to be going out of his way to offend certain demographic groups.""Mr. Trump also belittled Sen. Mark Kirk, the Illinois Republican locked in a tight re-election race who rescinded his endorsement of Mr. Trump last month. Mr. Trump called Mr. Kirk a ""loser"" and predicted he would lose his race, according to someone familiar with the discussion. Mr. Kirk wasn't present at the meeting.Mr. Trump also said he believed Mr. Kirk privately supported him but felt he had to publicly disavow him, according to two people familiar with his remarks.Mr. Kirk said he didn't have any reaction to Mr. Trump's comments, and predicted that Mr. Trump wouldn't win in Democratic-leaning Illinois.Mr. Trump faced tough questions from House Republicans, who pressed him on his approach to Hispanic voters. Mr. Trump early in his campaign said many Hispanics crossing the southern border are rapists and criminals. Rep. Cresent Hardy, a Nevada Republican facing a tight re-election race, asked Mr. Trump how his campaign style would register in swing states like Nevada, with a large Hispanic population.Mr. Trump told House Republicans his polling has shown Hispanics support him more strongly than they did Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee in 2012. Mr. Hardy said he was satisfied by Mr. Trump's response that he was confident he could win swing states, but others remained skeptical.Mr. Trump's pitch to lawmakers highlighted his argument that Republicans should want him to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy and any others in the next four years.""He made the point over and over again and I think he's right: 'Even if some of you don't agree with me, look at the Supreme Court,'"" said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R., Neb.). Mr. Fortenberry said he would vote for Mr. Trump but didn't want ""to be proximate to unstudied remarks or bluster.""---Reid J.

Trump and the Broad Street Bullies,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802302299?accountid=12768,"Later this month, Hillary Clinton will receive the nomination of her party in Philadelphia at an arena not much more than a long slap shot away from the site of the Spectrum, where the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team once played. This short stretch of South Broad Street holds some reminders that are still relevant today.In the mid-1970s, the Flyers won two straight Stanley Cups. Known as ""the Broad Street Bullies,"" the team combined a few highly skilled players with a posse of tough guys to intimidate their opponents. In 1976 the Montreal Canadiens, with players quicker and more talented and with a style of play to match, beat the Flyers in the finals in four straight games. I was a member of that Montreal team.The Flyers had entered the National Hockey League as one of six new expansion teams when the NHL doubled in size in 1967, but they got the shortest of all the short straws. The existing ""Original Six"" teams made available to the Flyers next to nothing in the expansion draft, and while it was the same for the other new markets, they at least had some history of hockey success. Philadelphia had none. The Flyers would need to compete on the ice with a team that wasn't competitive, and off the ice for new fans who, like old fans, don't like losing. It was possible that some new teams, particularly Philadelphia, would fail.In 1971 the Flyers hired a smart, cynical and pragmatic coach, Fred Shero. To win, to give the Flyers a chance to survive, Shero had a choice. He could try to make the team a lot better fast, an impossible task, or he could try to make his opponents worse.Intimidation has been employed as a strategy throughout hockey's history, by player against player, by some teams against certain others. But for the Flyers, intimidation was the basic team approach. A superior player who is not focused completely on what makes him superior, but is distracted by concerns for his safety, is no longer superior. The Flyers would drag opponents down to their level, then win with their own sprinkling of stars.Other teams had been tough; the Flyers were punishing. Some players, when the Flyers were the next opponent on the schedule, suddenly came down with the ""Philadelphia flu,"" as it came to be known, and were unable to play. The Broad Street Bullies began dominating the league.Lots of people also aren't given much when they start out. Most decide that's how things work and do the best they can within the system of which they are a part. But many come to feel left out of this system that makes the decisions that controls their lives. Sometimes those left out become the focus of political parties that promise to right the imbalance. Sometimes, though rarely, one such party wins power. But even then, change is usually hard to detect, and over time most of these outsiders lose interest in politics. To them, if not to the parties themselves, one political party led by people not like them is merely a close variation of another.Then along comes Donald Trump. An insider in most of his life, he is an outsider to politics. He knows, like Fred Shero knew, that in time some people (and players) do well, but most will never win. They are not talented enough, or privileged enough, or enough of whatever it is the game requires to make it to the top. Mr. Trump persuades them, as Shero had done with his players, that they don't have to accept their fate and stay on the sidelines, but can fight back in ways that serious people in politics and sports don't fight, but could in ways that are suited to them.Mr. Trump himself couldn't fight back within the existing party system. No party would have sought him as its leader. But he didn't need the media and public attention that a party ensures; he is Trump. He didn't need its respectability; people can decide for themselves how much that matters to them. At first, the Trump candidacy seemed laughable to insiders, to those who counted--to party leaders and the media--then irrelevant, then outrageous, then scary. At the same time, those who counted fought back using the skills, smartness and party privilege that had always won them the game. But as with teams playing against the Flyers during those two years in the 1970s, taking that approach didn't work.Now many of those same serious people are waiting for Mr. Trump to become more presidential, to give up his game for theirs, just as hockey waited for the Flyers to abandon their brawling tactics and shrink back into respectability. That didn't happen as long as they were winning, and this won't happen either. For Trump and many of his supporters, why give up the game they are winning to play a game they are sure to lose?Other NHL teams couldn't beat the Flyers at their game; you can't beat Mr. Trump at his. Those menacing ""be careful"" warnings of his on Twitter, his encouragement of violence toward protesters at rallies, his anti-immigrant rhetoric--intimidation, easily masked as strength and toughness, can work. The Canadiens won in the 1970s by standing up to the Flyers and by coming up with a better, more worthy game. The challenge for Hillary Clinton is to do the same.Mr. Dryden is a former member of the Canadian Parliament and goaltender for the Montreal Canadiens.

Election 2016: VP Prospect Backs Abortion --- Flynn's comments prompt pushback in latest snag for Trump running mate effort,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805664655?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a possible vice presidential pick for presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, came out in favor of abortion rights on Sunday, taking a stand on a divisive issue that puts him sharply at odds with the majority of Republican officeholders, activists and voters.Lt. Gen. Flynn, a registered Democrat who most recently served in President Barack Obama's administration as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said in an interview with ABC News that women ""have to be able to choose"" whether to get an abortion. ""They are the ones that have to make the decision because they're the ones that are going to decide to bring up that child or not,"" he said.Lt. Gen. Flynn is reportedly being considered as a running mate for Mr. Trump, but his support for abortion rights could complicate a bid to win a spot on the GOP ticket.Mr. Trump has run against abortion rights during this election campaign but has said in the past he supports abortion. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.Lt. Gen. Flynn's comments are the latest complication for Mr. Trump's effort to recruit a running mate after several prominent Republicans removed themselves from consideration.Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, a rising GOP star, said she was focused on her job in the Senate, while one of the Senate's top foreign policy experts, Bob Corker of Tennessee, removed himself from the running last week. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said she wasn't being vetted.Candidates reportedly being considered include former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.Republicans have long included opposition to abortion rights in their official party platform, while social conservatives and religious voters remain an important constituency within the party.Mr. Trump's vice presidential nominee would need to be approved by delegates at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this month. Some Republicans opposed to Mr. Trump are pushing a last-ditch effort to force a vote on the convention floor on whether to replace him as the nominee.The selection of a pro-abortion rights vice presidential nominee could throw the convention into further chaos and divide the party in advance of the fall election.Lt. Gen. Flynn's remarks drew quick criticism from antiabortion groups and conservative activists.Lt. Gen. Flynn ""has disqualified himself from consideration as vice president. His pro-abortion position is unacceptable and would undermine the pro-life policy commitments that Mr. Trump has made throughout the campaign,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List.""Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is a war hero and an expert in foreign policy. He should stick with what he knows. Social conservatives would consider it a slap in the face if he is chosen as VP,"" said Penny Young Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, a conservative group.Lt. Gen. Flynn held a number of top positions in the Army, including intelligence chief for the Joint Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command. He was appointed by Mr. Obama as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012.He left the job and retired from the military in 2014. In an op-ed piece last week in the New York Post, Lt. Gen. Flynn said he was fired for his efforts to change the nation's military intelligence apparatus.""If our leaders were interested in winning, they would have to design a strategy to destroy this global enemy,"" Lt. Gen. Flynn wrote about the broader fight against Islamic-inspired terrorism. ""But they don't see the global war. Instead, they timidly nibble around the edges of the battlefields from Africa to the Middle East, and act as if each fight, whether in Syria, Iraq, Nigeria, Libya or Afghanistan, can be peacefully resolved by diplomatic effort.""Credit: By Byron Tau",9/27/16
"Presidential Debate Sets Viewership Record; Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton scored huge live-TV audience, with 84 million viewers",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1823532464?accountid=12768,"The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was the most watched ever, as 84 million people tuned in to see the candidates spar at Hofstra University, according to Nielsen.The ratings surpassed the previous record held by the sole debate in 1980 between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, which drew 80.6 million viewers. Next on the list is a 1992 contest between Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot, at 69.9 million.The first debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney four years ago brought in 67.2 million viewers.NBC led the pack among broadcast networks with 18.2 million viewers, followed by ABC with 13.5 million and CBS with 12.1 million. Fox News beat out the cable competition with 11.4 million, compared to CNN's 9.8 million and 4.9 million on MSNBC.Anticipation for Monday's first general-election debate was high as national and battleground state polls showed a tight race, with Mrs. Clinton's lead narrowing. High expectations were fueled by the huge audiences the primary debates drew earlier in the election season.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump clashed on issues ranging from jobs to race to international trade at the debate, which was moderated by ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt.The prime-time debate predictably dragged down ratings for ""Monday Night Football"" on ESPN. The Atlanta Falcons' victory over the New Orleans Saints drew about 8 million viewers on the network. While the contest was considered a weaker one, ratings still fell more than ad buyers expected .Viewership for the debate was fragmented across many TV channels. Live streams also were available on some broadcasters' over-the-top applications, as well as platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, which wouldn't be included in Nielsen's traditional ratings. There were 55 million views of debate-related Facebook Live videos, the company said Tuesday, and 18.6 million people in the U.S. generated 73.8 million likes, posts, comments and shares.While the broadcast itself was free of advertising, marketers benefited from Monday night's large TV audience before and after the debate, as brands such as Audi and GoDaddy released election-themed ads in an effort to capitalize on the political buzz.Write to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.comCredit: By Steven Perlberg",9/28/16

Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Time of Testing Arrives for Ryan and Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803009488?accountid=12768,"Next week's Republican convention represents a turning point for Donald Trump. But it will be no less a turning point for House Speaker Paul Ryan -- and, by extension, for the rest of the Republican Party.Mr. Ryan will be the chairman of the convention and, as such, walking a tightrope. He has endorsed but not embraced Mr. Trump. His convention role is largely symbolic but nevertheless important. In carrying it out, he must try to please both Mr. Trump's many supporters, and the many party regulars who are trying to look away from (and perhaps beyond) their presumptive nominee.In short, Mr. Ryan will be trying to do the near-impossible: Unify a party while standing a bit apart from the man who at the convention takes his place, at least for now, as the nominal leader of that party.But that is only the beginning of the balancing acts for Mr. Ryan. He will play a leading role in the continuing Republican drama regardless of the outcome of November's election.If Mr. Trump wins, many Republicans hope and assume the lead in setting policy can be moved down Pennsylvania Avenue, from the White House to a Congress led by Mr. Ryan as well as Senate leader Mitch McConnell and a renewed Republican majority.Mr. Trump is running a policy-light campaign, the thinking goes, one long on populist impulses but short on a detailed agenda. That raises the possibility that congressional Republicans could and would step into the vacuum, reversing a policy-making flow that in the last several decades has tended to run from executive branch to legislative branch.This is precisely the notion Mr. Ryan has been advancing in recent weeks by rolling out in the House a series of proposals designed to show what a Congress-led Republican agenda on taxes, health and education can look like.Nobody is more hopeful that this approach will take root than are Mr. Ryan's compatriots in the party's conservative wing, who disagree with Mr. Trump on plenty, including trade and immigration.Mr. Ryan has explained his endorsement of Mr. Trump by saying the business leader would, as president, sign into law the pieces of that Republican agenda. Yet it is far from clear that Mr. Trump, hardly a shy and retiring sort, would be willing to see policy-making power move away from him. It's also unclear how Mr. Ryan would respond when a President Trump asked him to get to work passing legislation to dismantle free-trade treaties or provide funds to build a new wall along the Mexican border.If Mr. Trump loses, on the other hand, the Ryan role would be radically different. The one-time GOP vice presidential nominee would instantly become the de facto leader of the party, more free than ever to try to mold it in his own image and likeness.It's safe to say Republicans would be in a mess. Mr. Trump would have activated millions of supporters who have bought into his combative populism and won't be ready to let it go, with or without Mr. Trump. This year's primary battles revealed just how deeply many Republicans mistrust their own party's establishment, and Mr. Ryan now represents that establishment to many of them.But offsetting that populist army would be a resurgent force of social and ideological conservatives who, in the wake of a defeat by a man they distrusted and in some cases flatly opposed, will be ready to reassert their primacy. The rift could well be a deep and angry one, and it will be Mr. Ryan's to try to close. The problems would start with replaying the debate of the last four years over the party's stance on immigration and whether it needs to do more to appeal to Hispanics.Mr. Ryan's task would be further complicated by the fact that he has his own enemies within. Trusted as he is by most conservatives, some in the tea-party wing think he has been too representative of the Washington establishment they hate and too open to working with Democrats. Meantime, he is being actively opposed in the Republican primary in his district in Wisconsin that isn't especially friendly for a Republican in a general election.So, given all that, how does he propose to handle the convention next week? He plans to give a speech Tuesday night that aides say will stress the policy ideas he has been laying out, which he argues are what can unite Republicans. And he plans to spend a fair amount of time working what amounts to the grass-roots of a convention -- the meetings of state delegations.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",9/29/16
Trump Still Finds Few Backers in Congress,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801724289?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON--Less than two weeks before the Republican convention, the party's congressional wing is no more enthusiastic about Donald Trump for president than when he two months ago.Several Republicans are withholding their endorsements, while others simply ignore the question when asked. A number of GOP lawmakers don't plan to attend the nominating convention in Cleveland, which starts July 18.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), when asked about Mr. Trump last week, said the New York businessman "" in order to win. ""My hope is that he is beginning to pivot and become what I would call a more serious and credible candidate for the highest office in the land,"" Mr. McConnell told .Republicans have become adept at finding diplomatic ways to couch their concerns.""I always look for constant improvement,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) told reporters Tuesday, when asked about his level of comfort with Mr. Trump.Supporters of the candidate, who is scheduled to meet with House and Senate Republicans here on Thursday, say if there is one thing that could shift the dynamic ahead of the convention it is Mr. Trump himself. Compared with his campaign stump speeches, Mr. Trump cuts a different, more personable and personal profile in the small question-and-answer sessions that are a feature of closed-door meetings on Capitol Hill.""He is down to earth; he is spontaneous,"" said Rep. Chris Collins (R., N.Y.), one of Mr. Trump's early congressional endorsers. ""I think what will come of the meeting is a comfort level for those who have never met him.""Mr. Trump faces a dubious crowd. Not only has Mr. McConnell complained that Mr. Trump doesn't know the issues, but House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) criticized Mr. Trump only a day after endorsing him June 2.On Tuesday, Mr. Ryan that it had to ""clean up"" its use of social media after the candidate's Twitter account on Saturday posted, then later changed, an image of Hillary Clinton and piles of cash along with a interpreted by many as a Star of David, with the words ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!""""Look, anti-Semitic images, they've got no place in presidential campaigns. Candidates should know that,"" Mr. Ryan told Wisconsin radio show host Charlie Sykes. ""I don't know what flunky put this up there, they obviously gotta fix that,"" he said.One vulnerable Senate Republican, Mark Kirk of Illinois, has taken back his endorsement of Mr. Trump. Another, Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), in an interview last week listed concern after concern about the candidate. Mr. Lee isn't sure whether he will endorse Mr. Trump--or even attend the meeting.Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), who once suggested to CNN that he would campaign with Mr. Trump, joking that it would be ""the Ronald and the Donald,"" said last week the remarks were taken out of context.""I am not commenting on Donald Trump,"" Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) said last week, sticking to a line he has used regularly for weeks when asked by reporters.Mr. Trump's past remarks still sting on Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers fiercely protect the institution. It has also been personal. Mr. Trump said last year that Mr. McCain wasn't a war hero and this year suggested that Sen. Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy.The likely Republican nominee told ABC in May that it would be better if the party were unified--although it didn't have to be--then said last week that the Republicans who challenged him in the primary but won't endorse him should ""never be allowed to run for public office again.""Though Mr. Trump met with congressional leaders in May, this week will be the first time his meetings will include rank-and-file GOP lawmakers. ""Probably some people will give their opinions and ideas about how to run the campaign,"" Mr. McCarthy said.With the relationship between Mr. Trump and his nominal GOP allies still tenuous, some Republicans are working to put the two sides on the same policy ground before the convention. The most determined driver of a policy vision is Mr. Ryan, who has put forth House Republicans' six-part agenda, which includes replacing the Affordable Care Act, one of the few areas on which Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have clear agreement.Mr. McCarthy, who will be attending the GOP convention as a California delegate, said Tuesday he expected the agenda would be the prime topic of Mr. Trump's Thursday visit.Still, more than a few Republicans are steering clear of the convention entirely, avoiding the need to clarify their common policy goals. The list includes Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R., N.H.), and Mr. Kirk, along with Mr. McCain and Rep. Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.)Besides Mr. Collins, possible bridge builders include Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who is Mr. Trump's most high-profile supporter in Congress, and Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), who met with Mr. Trump in New York in May and was scheduled to attend a rally in North Carolina with him Tuesday night, according to someone familiar with the event.Mr. Trump himself has begun taking the edge off of some of his positions. After last year calling for banning Muslims from entering the U.S., he has to calling for blocking immigrants from countries with terrorist links. Republicans in Congress were later reassured when Mr. Trump's chief policy adviser said that the likely nominee was ""adamantly nonproliferation"" after Mr. Trump had earlier suggested that the U.S. should with countries like Japan and South Korea and allow them to build their own nuclear arsenals.Some bridges may be impossible to build. Mr. Trump has hardened his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that many Senate Republicans have backed and that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a big supporter of Republicans, has embraced.""We're going to agree to disagree on some things,"" Mr. Ryan told reporters last month. ""What we do agree on is we don't want another Democrat in the White House.""Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson atCredit: By Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson",9/29/16
Trump Business Reach Stirs Conflict Questions --- Conflict-of-interest question would loom if the businessman were elected president,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1801515558?accountid=12768,"NEW YORK--Back in his 26th-floor office after a recent campaign swing, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sat down at his desk and began signing a two-inch stack of checks, including ones for $10,000 for fuel, $21,000 for concrete and $99,000 to a contractor at a hotel construction site.Mr. Trump personally oversees many of his routine business expenses this way. Yet he also says he would separate himself from that business empire, and the many potential conflicts of interest it might create, by putting his ownership into a blind trust, most likely with his adult children as its trustees, if he were elected president.""I wouldn't mind a blind trust,"" he said in a recent interview. ""I would be doing one thing. My total focus would be on making this country great again. I wouldn't even think about the company.""As Mr. Trump heads into the general election, the conflicts-of-interest question is big and complex. That is because the Trump Organization, which is owned solely by him, consists mostly of operating assets, as opposed to passive investments. Hundreds of business entities, including some in foreign countries, own or manage hotels, commercial and residential real estate, golf resorts and even part of the reality TV show ""The Apprentice.""""Trump's empire would pose unprecedented conflicts of interest due to the size of its holdings, privately held nature of the family-run business, and concentration in one industry,"" said Richard Painter, University of Minnesota law professor who was the White House's chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush.""A blind trust would never work in Trump's case, because his assets are known, not blind, and children aren't independent trustees,"" he added, noting that other modern-era wealthy presidents, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, were ""old-money with diversified holdings"" that didn't directly manage businesses the way Mr. Trump does.No federal law would require Mr. Trump, famous for putting his name on his swath of enterprises, to remove himself from running his empire, ethics experts say. But Mr. Trump, who has financed some of his real estate with debt and expanded his organization globally, would be closely scrutinized for any policy stance that would affect banking, real estate or the foreign countries where his properties sit.Mr. Trump dismisses those concerns, saying his business dealings wouldn't influence how he would approach the banking or real-estate sectors or foreign policy. He also said he would let other executives run the trust if his children would be considered too close to him to serve as trustees.""I'll do whatever I have to do,"" the New York billionaire said in Trump Tower recently. ""I'll do whatever makes people comfortable. It's very easy.""Mr. Trump and a small coterie of executives and three of his adult children--Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric--maintain a tight grip on all major assets, which . Even though Mr. Trump controls outgoing expenditures, he has transferred most of the day-to-day management of the empire's strategy and operations to those three children.But Mr. Trump seems unable to help himself from meddling in operations. When he recently stopped by the in Washington, D.C., which he is renovating into a luxury hotel, he inspected the finishes on wall moldings and queried the hotel manager on the size of a reception area. ""Is it too late to change it now?"" Mr. Trump asked.Yet, the , including the 100% owned-and-operated properties. Ivanka Trump oversaw the $350 million acquisition and renovation of Trump National Doral, the 800-acre Miami hotel and spa, while her brother Eric supervised improvements to indoor and outdoor public spaces throughout its golf resort.Donald Jr., who runs most of the company's commercial leasing, has pushed rents higher and occupancy to 97% at the commercial office building 40 Wall Street in a ""re-set"" with new leases on 750,000 square feet of the building, according to a Trump executive. By far, the most lucrative commercial lease in a Trump-owned property is the street-level Gucci store at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, which pays $18 million in annual rent, the executive said.The Trump empire also makes money on real estate it doesn't own. Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver, set to open in August, is expected to provide a sizable annual revenue stream from management fees as the hotel operator and from licensing fees for real-estate sales of the condominiums.As Mr. Trump continued signing his stack of checks, which he occasionally does on his private jet when on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump added: ""Signing checks is just one way...to know what's really going on...I sign my own checks as much as possible.""The potential for conflicts abounds. In his campaign financial statement, Mr. Trump disclosed loans and personal guarantees ranging from $315 million to $500 million from a total of 10 creditors. ""The loans are a tiny proportion of my net worth,"" he said.The Trump Organization now has five licensing deals for mixed-use luxury properties in India and other hotel, residential and development projects around the globe, Ivanka Trump said. Foreign interests provide revenue from management and licensing fees because Mr. Trump doesn't have ownership stakes, with the exception of Trump properties in the U.K., which are wholly owned, she said.Democrats have said Mr. Trump's conflicts of interest are already on display in his public comments. He handling a civil case against his now-defunct Trump University, based on the judge's ethnicity, and he cited an Internal Revenue Service audit of his taxes as a reason he won't release his tax returns. Last month, he commented on the U.K. vote to leave the European Union while in Scotland promoting a newly renovated golf resort.Significant conflicts of interest also arise over presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her , ethics experts say. ""Clinton's conflict also would be unprecedented with the scale and breadth of her family foundation, because it has been receiving substantial gifts from private parties, including some from outside the United States,"" said Mr. Painter, of the University of Minnesota. He suggests both candidates separate themselves and their family members from their organizations.Mrs. Clinton ""stepped down from the foundation just prior to launching her campaign last year,"" a spokesman said. Former President Bill Clinton has said the foundation's work and structure would change if his wife were elected president.Mr. Trump dismissed the idea of the need for a complete undoing of his family business. ""It's almost like there is no conflict,"" the businessman said. ""The better I do as president, the better it is for my business--and everybody's business.""Write to Monica Langley at monica.langley@wsj.comCredit: By Monica Langley",9/29/16
An Explainer on the Tax Benefit Donald Trump May Have Used; Tax laws that allow net operating losses to be carried over to other tax years can be financially lucrative,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825143122?accountid=12768,"News that Donald Trump claimed a $916 million net operating loss on 1995 state tax returns has led to speculation that he could have wiped out his tax liabilities for more than 15 years. Net operating loss carry-overs are legal behavior and have long been a feature of the tax code. Here are some basics:Q. Where did the concept originate to allow certain losses to be carried over to other tax years?A. The Revenue Act of 1918 introduced the idea of allowing taxpayers to carry over net-operating losses, known as NOL, to other tax years, temporarily allowing for an NOL to be carried back one year and then forward one year. Today, carry-over periods reach 20 years; losses can be carried back two years.Q. What's the idea behind it?A. Allowing businesses to carry forward (and carry back) loss helps them better weather the economy's inevitable ups and downs, advocates argue. It lets businesses and their owners smooth out their incomes and tax bills over multiple years, giving them a better chance at long-term survival. Some economists argue that the carry-over also can help counteract economic downturns.Q. Who tends to use it the most?A. Cyclical businesses that can suffer heavy losses in downturns, such as consumer-goods makers. Owners of real-estate investment firms, with big interest and depreciation deductions, also can benefit. Other rules benefit real-estate investors such as Donald Trump, including the ability to use losses to offset other kinds of income.Q. Do taxpayers ever claim losses that didn't exist?A. Because the NOL carry-over is a potentially lucrative break, it has occasionally led people to concoct schemes aimed at generating big NOL's on paper that they then use to claim big refunds of prior-year taxes.Q. How controversial has this provision been in Congress?A. There has been debate, but the basic principle of business NOL carry-over has been embraced and expanded in recent years by both parties.Q. Is there any push now to take this away, or modify it?A. Progressives often criticize the NOL break as a giveaway to business, but there has been little serious effort in Congress to take it away. Some states have reduced the benefits of the NOL break, principally for budget reasons, and often state rules aren't as generous as the federal rules.Write to John D.

Political Reporters' Hobgoblin; Trump and Clinton are inconsistent. So what? It's naive to expect otherwise.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825134096?accountid=12768,"'A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."" So wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay ""Self-Reliance."" Since Emerson himself was perhaps the least consistent of writers, often saying one thing in one place and its opposite in another, the remark bears the unmistakable stamp of self-justification. I haven't for a long while wandered through the journals, letters, sermons and other writing of this most overrated of American scribblers, but I shouldn't be in the least surprised to discover that somewhere Emerson also wrote that consistency is the hallmark of large minds.I have been thinking of that Emerson sentence a fair amount of late when watching television political reporters, anchors, commentators--Chuck Todd, Bret Baier, John Dickerson and others--interview politicians, their managers and so-called party strategists. Increasingly these interviews center on the search for inconsistencies (more precisely, contradictions). How do the politicians' current views compare with the views they held earlier in their careers? Or, in the case of our current presidential candidates, the views they held as recently as two or three days ago? By this ploy, television reporters attempt to demonstrate that politicians, like rubber sandals, flip-flop. But to what avail? The law of contradiction, after all, is not enforceable; if it were the jails would overflow.In the instances of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, it is scarcely surprising that contradictions pop up with the regularity of fleas on a junkyard dog. Both are what I should call Kentucky-windage politicians: Without genuine beliefs, each always checks which way the wind--that is, voter sentiment--is blowing before firing away.It is naive to expect consistency from politicians, to say nothing of devotion to principles, and more than naive to think that catching their contradictions will slow them down in any significant way. With votes at stake, with polls changing almost hourly, it is only natural that politicians and their close supporters provide a nearly endless stream of pronunciamentos rife with contradictions.What does a reporter gain in confronting politicians with their inconsistencies? Pointing out to a politician that he claimed to be for this or that program in 2009 and now he claims to be against it is roughly as telling a criticism as informing a streetwalker that her hem is perhaps a touch too high. Do political commentators truly expect politicians, when confronted with evidence of their contradictions, to respond, ""You're right. You know, I never thought of that.""I've long held that the world's dumbest question, asked repeatedly by female reporters on the sidelines after sporting events, is ""What was on your mind when . . . [fill in the event]?"" A truthful answer is probably that the athlete knew once the game ended he would have to face the inanity of the question of what was on his mind and have an answer ready.Catching out a politician in a contradiction may be an even more empty exercise. Politicians never admit it. Instead, they waffle, they wobble, they claim to have been misunderstood, they bob and weave and artfully dodge the charge. Donald Trump and the dreary birther question is a case in point. Yes, the Trump camp avers, he may have doubted Barack Obama's birth. But they add that the lubricious Sidney Blumenthal started the rumor that the president wasn't born in this country when Mrs. Clinton ran against Mr. Obama in 2008.Even if politicians could be got to admit the contradictory nature of their current with their former views, would it really matter? Who knows: In their defense they might even cite the stale Emerson quotation.Rather than cite contradictions, which abound without ultimate significance, television reporters would be much more useful if they put politicians' and candidates' feet to the fire on views they currently claim to hold. They might ask Mr. Trump how, precisely, he plans to restore American military might and at what cost, or by what means he thinks he can defeat ISIS. He has been claiming for months now that he can easily do both without anyone pressing him on these matters.They might ask Mrs. Clinton, who is keen on aligning herself with the Black Lives Matter movement, for her thoughts on the vast number of black-on-black killings that now number in the tens of thousands in the black ghetto neighborhoods, and whether Black Lives Matter doesn't actually deflect attention from this much more serious problem.They might ask politicians who have served more than two terms in the Senate or six in the House how they happen to have become multimillionaires on their relatively modest political salaries. There is no want of good questions to ask politicians--none of which begin, ""In 2011 you said . . .""Mr. Epstein's books include ""Frozen in Time: Twenty Stories"" and ""Wind Sprints: Shorter Essays.""Credit: By Joseph Epstein",10/3/16
"Election 2016: Trump and Pence Differ on Tone, Issues",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804473120?accountid=12768,"Republican Donald Trump ended weeks of speculation Friday by naming Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, a choice meant to bolster the presumptive nominee with Midwestern voters and the party's conservative base.The selection was cheered by many of the same conservative leaders who haven't yet endorsed Mr. Trump, but it also spotlights some of the policy and stylistic stances that make the presumptive Republican nominee an outlier in the party he now leads.During the primary, Mr. Trump frequently criticized the war in Iraq; Mr. Pence voted to support it. Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of free trade; Mr. Pence is a strong proponent. Mr. Trump has panned Republican-led efforts to overhaul Medicare and Social Security; Mr. Pence has championed many of those efforts. And, of course, Mr. Pence endorsed Mr. Trump's top rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.Temperamentally, the two Republicans are very different: Mr. Trump is a New York billionaire who regularly courts controversy, relishes name-calling and makes no secret of his mutable policy views, while Mr. Pence is a low-key Midwestern governor who presents himself as an always-upbeat conservative crusader with deeply held convictions, and whose net worth was less than $400,000 when he left the House.Messrs. Trump and Pence are hardly the first ticket to present a contrast of personalities or policy beliefs. Ronald Reagan picked George H.W. Bush in 1980 to shore up his support from the GOP's establishment wing, while a polished, young Barack Obama picked the older, plain-spoken Joe Biden in 2008 to give their ticket more experience.In many ways, picking Mr. Pence represents one of the few conventional decisions Mr. Trump has made in this campaign. The uncharacteristic choice and its rollout were amplified on Friday.Hours after Mr. Trump confirmed his pick in a Twitter post, campaign aides had to rebut multiple reports that Mr. Trump had second thoughts and even inquired about dumping the governor as his running mate.""Totally false,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview on Friday afternoon.""There's no way to predict chemistry,"" said Kevin Sheridan, a top aide to the last GOP vice-presidential nominee, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, during the 2012 campaign. ""If it works, the rollout will be forgotten. If it doesn't, people will point to it as the first sign of a troubled marriage.""Mr. Trump and his running mate both favor tax cuts as a way to spur the economy. Mr. Pence has consistently championed tax cuts since taking over as governor in 2013, leading efforts to lower Indiana's income tax and reduce others. The two Republicans also see eye-to-eye about increasing the defense budget, cracking down on illegal immigration and protecting gun rights.Their views align on most social issues, but Mr. Trump is a recent convert in opposing abortion and gay marriage. Mr. Pence has a much longer record of fighting to restrict both. He signed legislation making it easier for business owners to deny service to gay couples, before an outcry forced him to soften the law.Their biggest splits come on trade and foreign policy. Mr. Trump regularly bashes the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Mr. Pence was an early and consistent supporter of the war. Mr. Pence has also been critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin and called for the U.S. to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Trump has been a fierce critic of NATO and pledges to work more closely with Mr. Putin.Mr. Pence criticized Mr. Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, following the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.Differences between the two men could serve them well with some of the conservative activists who are reluctant to back Mr. Trump. ""Mike Pence would be an outstanding vice president,"" said David McIntosh, a former Indiana congressman and president of the Club for Growth, which spent millions trying to deny Mr. Trump the nomination.Democrats quickly sought to turn the pick against Mr. Trump, with Hillary Clinton's campaign dubbing the Indiana governor the ""most extreme VP pick in a generation.""---Damian Paletta contributed to this article.Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",10/3/16
Christie Keeps Focus on Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804472992?accountid=12768,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie saw his last hope to run on the 2016 presidential ticket dashed Friday, but some state lawmakers and political observers said the governor's national ambitions will keep pulling his attention away from the Statehouse.Mr. Christie, who has 18 months left in office, has been accused of shirking responsibilities at home during the past year as he waged his unsuccessful bid for president and then campaigned for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.While Mr. Trump didn't choose Mr. Christie as his running mate, Mr. Christie is leading Mr. Trump's transition team, which is responsible for preparing the candidate for the possibility of the presidency. Mr. Christie is also expected to keep campaigning for Mr. Trump as the general election heats up.Aides to Mr. Christie didn't return requests for comment on Friday after Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that he tapped Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to join him on the GOP ticket. On Thursday, Mr. Christie said in an interview with MSNBC that he would remain closely involved in Mr. Trump's campaign regardless of whether the governor appeared on the Nov. 8 ballot.""He is a great friend and a person Mr. Trump has tremendous respect for,"" Mr. Trump's spokeswoman said in an email, referring to Mr. Christie.Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat from Middlesex County, said he expects the governor, who is prevented by law from seeking a third term, to make ""auditioning for a cabinet post"" in a possible Trump administration a priority over addressing state issues, such as New Jersey's depleted transportation trust fund.Mr. Wisniewski pointed to Mr. Christie's insistence on cutting the state sales tax in exchange for a gas-tax increase to fund transportation projects as evidence that the governor is seeking to burnish his national conservative credentials.""His policy decisions in New Jersey are more about hewing to a certain political orthodoxy so he can be viable on a national stage,"" said Mr. Wisniewski, who believes Mr. Christie's proposed sales-tax cut would be too costly.Assemblyman Jon Bramnick, the chamber's GOP leader, said the governor's sales-tax proposal is about ""giving money back to the taxpayers"" and accused Democrats of blocking Mr. Christie's efforts to overhaul the state's school funding formula and reduce public-pension costs.""It doesn't make any difference if Chris Christie is here, in Iowa or traveling the country with Donald Trump,"" Mr. Bramnick said. ""Democrats who are controlling the Legislature won't make the necessary changes to make the state more affordable.""Mr. Christie, who spent 261 partial or full days traveling outside of New Jersey in 2015, has sought to quell criticism about his out-of-state travel since ending his presidential bid in February.The governor held frequent news conferences this spring as he pushed for a state takeover of Atlantic City, personally negotiated still-pending legislation to renew the state's transportation trust fund and held several town-hall meetings to lobby for his proposed school funding overhaul.Still, the governor faces low job approval numbers, a looming federal trial involving former top allies accused in the George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal and a Legislature that is already anticipating his departure.Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said he believes the federal investigations, in particular, made Mr. Christie a less attractive option for vice presidentDavid Samson, a former appointee and longtime ally of Mr. Christie, pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal bribery charge. Two of the governor's former top aides are scheduled to go on trial in September in connection with the 2013 bridge scandal.""It doesn't matter that the governor isn't on trial. It's going to be revelation after revelation of how the Christie administration did business,"" Mr. Dworkin said. ""A six-week corruption trial involving top members of your administration puts a story that you don't want in the news in the heart of the final push for the election.""Mr. Christie wasn't charged by federal authorities and has denied any wrongdoing.State Sen. Joe Kyrillos, a Republican, said simply being vetted for vice president was an accomplishment.""Given the significant obstacles in his way, it's amazing that he got as far as he did and I'm happy for him,"" Mr. Kyrillos said. ""It will be tricky to lead the transition preparation, be on the campaign trail and be the governor of a major state, which in the easiest of times is not a part-time job.""Former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, a Republican, said he thinks Mr. Christie is ""lucky"" that he wasn't selected as Mr. Trump's running mate. Mr. Christie is better suited for another federal position, such as chief of staff or attorney general, Mr. Kean said.In the coming months in Trenton, Mr. Kean said, Mr. Christie may find willing negotiating partners among Democrats to deal with some thorny issues.""Some of the Democrats he's been negotiating with think of themselves as future governors,"" he said, ""so it's very much in their interest to get these issues off the table before they're in office.""Credit: By Kate King",10/3/16
The GOP's Trump Power Play,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804472927?accountid=12768,"Every poll shows that Donald Trump needs to shore up his support among wary Republicans if he wants to win in November. He and his allies at the Republican National Committee didn't help their cause with their power play Thursday night to shut off any debate at next week's convention in Cleveland.The RNC put the hammer down in a late-night session of the 112-member rules committee, which pounded through a rule requiring delegates to vote based on their state primary and caucus results. Allies of party chief Reince Priebus even twisted arms to squelch support for a minority report supporting a ""conscience clause"" that would have let delegates vote as they please. The minority report needed 28 votes to get a floor hearing next week but failed on a voice vote.Mr. Priebus and Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort want an orderly convention that suggests the GOP is more united than it is. But the irony is that by imposing such iron discipline they demonstrated that groups like Delegates Unbound were right in claiming that delegates aren't automatically bound to candidates, and that only a tailor-made convention rule could force delegates to follow state results. RNC lawyers vigorously denied that claim, but that's precisely the kind of rule they passed Thursday.Dianna Orrock, a national committeewoman for Nevada, bragged on Facebook that the ""strategy"" was that ""by our staying to complete our work late last night, rather than end at 6 pm and reconvene today, [we] wore down our opposition and didn't give them any opportunity to regroup."" Mr. Manafort crowed on Twitter: ""Anti-Trump people get crushed at Rules Committee."" Ah, the glories of backroom democracy.The real test for Messrs. Priebus and Manafort comes in November, and that will require persuasion more than loyalty tests. The ""anti-Trump"" representatives that Mr. Manafort disparaged represent hundreds of delegates who are loyal to Ted Cruz and other candidates, and whose support Mr. Trump needs. These are the state-level ground troops who get out the vote.The dissenting delegates weren't likely to get close to denying Mr. Trump the nomination, especially with Mr. Trump's choice of Mike Pence as a running mate and his recent gains in the polls. But allowing a debate would have been good democratic drama that might have attracted more news coverage, and Mr. Trump would be that much stronger as a nominee for having prevailed after a debate. Dissenting delegates will still find ways to express themselves, perhaps in media interviews and no doubt in the reception for Mr. Cruz when he speaks.The GOP last felt obliged to impose such strict delegate-binding rules in 1976, when Gerald Ford was trying to avoid floor defections to Ronald Reagan. Ford, aided by a young delegate manager named Paul Manafort, controlled the floor. He lost the election.",10/3/16
Clinton Foundation Amends Its Filing With New York; Move comes day after rival Donald Trump's charitable foundation was told to suspend fundraising in state,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825675967?accountid=12768,"Officials at the foundation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said they filed information Tuesday with the New York attorney general's office that was missing from previous disclosures.The move comes a day after Republican rival Donald Trump's charitable foundation was told to suspend its fundraising in the state because it violated registration requirements.A Clinton Foundation spokesman said the charity has complied with New York law, but amended its annual charitable filing with the office of Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, ""out of an abundance of caution."" The group said it would disclose more detailed financial data on its affiliates.A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said the foundation's filings for at least one year--in 2012--were incomplete. The attorney general's office didn't immediately release the new information provided by the foundation, and it wasn't clear whether it included additional audited information about the charity's foreign affiliates.The foundation's move comes as presidential contenders' philanthropic ventures have come under scrutiny.Mrs. Clinton's political rivals have questioned the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign government donations, including some that came during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton has denied any conflicts of interest and said she is proud of the foundation's work.Mr. Schneiderman's office said Monday it is demanding that Donald Trump's charitable foundation suspend fundraising activity in New York, issuing a cease-and-desist letter accusing Mr. Trump's family nonprofit of failing to register as a charity that raises money in the state.The foundation has 15 days from Sept. 30--the day the notice was dated--to correct its registration and file required paperwork.A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said the candidate questioned the political motives of Mr. Schneiderman, who supports Mrs. Clinton, and said the foundation would comply with Mr. Schneiderman's broader investigation into the charity.The Clinton Foundation has offered to share more details with Mr. Schneiderman's bureau about contributions from foreign governments. But a spokesman for the foundation said it hasn't received a request to do so from Mr. Schneiderman's office.New York requires that charitable organizations annually disclose and itemize the dollar amounts of grants made by a ""government agency.""The attorney general and the Clinton Foundation said they are currently interpreting that rule to be limited to grants from domestic government sources.The foundation in recent years has disclosed to New York officials its foreign government grants as a lump sum. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, the foundation's largest project, also makes annual financial disclosures to the attorney general, but neither itemizes its foreign government grants nor specifies a summary total dollar figure, a practice scrutinized in a Scripps News report from September.""CHAI also received foreign government contributions and can provide those in more details if needed,"" the group told the attorney general's office in a letter accompanying its most recent annual filing.Mr. Schneiderman's office says it has never demanded itemization of foreign government grants, but has said it is considering clarifying its requirements.Some foundations and charities have itemized foreign government grants in recent annual tax filings, including Family Care International, Action Against Hunger and the George W. Bush Foundation, which reported a $5 million grant from the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia in its 2013 filing.Write to James Grimaldi at James.Grimaldi@wsj.com and Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.comCredit: By James V.

We haven't confirmed its authenticity because, like the rest of the corrupt media, we're totally dishonest.Thank you, everybody, thank you. It's good to be back in Arizona. And you know we're going to win, right? The polls say we're going to win in Arizona, and we will.The polls also say we'd lose the general election if it were held today. But they're wrong. So wrong. You know how pollsters work? They guess who will show up to vote on election day, and then they poll these ""likely voters.""But let me tell you something. The pollsters have no clue. None. They don't have a clue who the electorate is, and they don't have a clue of what's going on in America. Believe me, folks, on election day they're going to find out.The other day, in Colombia -- I'm talking about the country in South America -- they held a vote. A referendum. President Santos staked his reputation on a, quote-unquote, peace deal with the terrorists of the FARC.Now the FARC, they're the worst people in the world. They've killed tens of thousands of people. They make their money through drug trafficking and kidnapping. They've been terrorizing Colombians for 50 years.Along comes Santos, and he makes this terrible deal that says to the FARC: We're not going to send you to jail. We're going to sentence your leaders to community service. We're even going to guarantee you seats in the Congress.And all the polls said the deal was going to win in a landslide. Obama and Kerry lined up behind it. Santos told Colombians they had no choice, that it was the only road to peace.Guess what? The polls were wrong. The Colombians knew a bad deal when they saw one. They weren't going to let killers get away with their crimes. The only deal they want with the FARC is the same deal Reagan got from Russia: We win, they lose.Folks, it was the same story with the Brexit vote in June. All the polls said the Brits wouldn't vote to leave the European Union. They did. All the experts said the sky would fall if the Brits voted to go. It didn't. These geniuses said that Britain was too small to be the master of its own destiny. The British people believe otherwise, and I'm with them!What happened in Britain, in Colombia, it's going to happen here. Because, like them, we're sick of it.We're sick of hearing ObamaCare is working when even the New York Timesadmits it's a total disaster. We're sick of hearing how great the economy is when it's floating on a big wave of cheap credit that benefits Wall Street at the expense of savers. We're sick of hearing how great the Iran deal is, then watching our sailors being humiliated while we secretly fork over pallets of cash.You know what we're also sick of? Liberal hypocrites.I'm not supposed to say the name I'm about to say. Well, two words: Alicia. Machado.Who is this Alicia Machado, other than a political prop for Hillary? She was a beauty queen for a business I helped run called ""Miss Universe."" The business of beauty queens is to be beautiful, just like it's the business of athletes to be fit. Duh! And when she gained some weight, I insisted she lose it. Did I call her ""Miss Piggy""? Boo hoo. Get over it.For this I'm being treated very badly. Let me ask you something: Other than Lena Dunham, when was the last time Anna Wintour ran a fat person on the cover of Vogue? And when was the last time Hillary said no to one of Ms. Wintour's big fundraisers because of Vogue's ""lookism""?So spare me the sensitivity lectures. Spare me the business lectures, too. Those tax returns someone stole and the New York Times published? The ones that showed I once lost nearly a billion dollars and used every legal trick in the book to stage a comeback?All of you here understand this is how business is done in America. Some years you make money. Some years you lose. You take advantage of every tax break you can because the government is trying to screw you every other way.That's the real world. It's only in the unreal world that Hillary lives in that you can make a fortune by being a failed secretary of state and then cash in on obscene speaking fees, or arrange for Bill to get an $18 million salary to be ""honorary chancellor"" at a for-profit college while the Obama administration destroys every other for-profit. That's called corruption, no matter whether it's legal or not.Folks, there's a giant wave coming. A tsunami of Americans who won't stand for being told we don't know what's good for us. Who refuse to be lectured by political grifters about how to make an honest buck. Who don't need our morals improved by Hillary Macbeth and Billy Caligula.

Declarations: Trump and the Unknowable Moment,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806205101?accountid=12768,"Cleveland -- Two headlines on the week, and some speeches.Donald Trump effectively won the Republican primary in the first week of May, meaning the GOP has had 2 1/2 months to do what it has always done, even under duress, such as in 1964 and 1976: come together. They have not. From day one of the convention it was clear the GOP is a bitterly divided party and not even bothering to hide it.It failed to unite not because it had poor leadership or the nominee didn't know how to do it, though both are true. More killingly it failed to unite because it didn't want to. Everyone's in his corner. Donald Trump failed to change his style in a way that would have given cover to those who would have, with considerable relief, joined him. On the other hand, anti-Trump forces continued to look down on Mr. Trump's supporters and grant them nothing in terms of motivation, sincerity, insight.Most important, though no one in Cleveland was keen to talk about it, there is the split between the base and the top on such huge and fundamental issues as immigration, trade and entitlements. The base came to this convention, which was middle-class and dressed down. The wealthy and connected largely stayed away. You didn't see them swanning from reception to party to caucus. It spoke volumes. Now and then you remember that snobbery is an actual force in life.If each side hates the other and believes in different things, how do they come together again?Connected to that, the second headline, which has to do with the unknowability of the moment we're in. The shrewdest old political pro, the brightest young delegate, the owlish political journalist -- they didn't know exactly what they were witnessing. Was it the formal start of an epic political disaster? The birth of a new GOP more identified with the struggles of its base? Is 2016 a particular and contained event, or does it mark the beginning of some long-term realignment? As for Mr. Trump, is he a lightning storm that lit things up, caused some damage, will play itself out and pass? Or is he an earthquake that changed the actual shape of things, the literal lay of the land?Nobody involved here, nobody watching, knew. I've never quite seen such intellectual modesty among people who are usually quick in their eagerness to explain it all to you.There were a number of good speeches. Donald Trump Jr. was strong and persuasive on Tuesday night. The next morning, at a Wall Street Journal event, he made a better case for his father than his father has. He talked about the forgotten middle American and referred to himself, humorously, as ""a Fifth Avenue redneck."" When pressed on how a man as divisive as his father could unify the nation, he answered that one way to unify the country is to see that its people have jobs: ""When people are doing well it's amazing how much unity you'll get from that."" I had the distinct impression I was listening to a future political candidate.Mike Pence's speech was modest, simple and strong. He is going to be a powerful and effective figure in the coming campaign. A longtime staffer told me he was surprised how relaxed the governor was as he prepared. He'd seen him over the years be nervous about smaller, less important speeches. Mr. Pence, the staffer said, told him the reason was that he was completely at peace with his decision to run with Mr. Trump.Ted Cruz did himself damage. By the end of his tireless campaign for the nomination he was semi-endearing. Wednesday night he resurrected Snaky Ted. He spoke highly of freedom and went after President Obama. Sometimes he half-laughed after speaking a line, as if to say You know this is showbiz, right? It showed an unbecoming detachment. He told the audience not to stay home in November but vote for the right person, then forgot to say who that person might be.If you can't endorse, good for you and stay home. That isn't politics, it's basic human comportment. If someone you're certain is awful invites you to a party, you politely decline. You don't go, walk into the room, and punch your host in the head. Mr. Cruz miscalculated, thinking if he snubbed Trump half the delegates would cheer. Instead almost all booed. He thought the media would laud his courage and integrity. They saw him as wounded and treated him as prey.When his campaign ended in June, I attended a small dinner in his honor. Mr. Cruz was charming, modest and funny. When we said goodnight I told him I felt, in retrospect, that I hadn't always been just to him and was glad I'd have a chance to be more generous in the future. Apparently I will need still more time. What a jerk.Donald Trump's speech was important. He is a vivid figure and for a year has elicited strong reactions. By now he's exhausting. We have Trump Fatigue. Also, who doesn't know how he feels about him? His acceptance speech was an opportunity to break through in a new way and flesh out his purpose. I think he succeeded, though with a certain grimness. He'd probably reply that the times are grim.We have to assess the true facts of our nation, he said: ""We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore."" He spoke of ""the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news,"" including the costs of illegal immigration and the victims of economic decline.He argued that the past eight years of U.S. foreign policy have been disastrous to peace and stability. ""But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.""Does he want a ban on Muslims? No. ""We must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place."" This stand has always driven his enemies crazy, and Mr. Trump usually spoke of it sloppily, either deliberately or not. But to most Americans it will sound like simple common sense.He was frankly populist: ""I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves . . . . My greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens."" He stands, he asserted, for ""the forgotten"" -- not as their tribune or their leader, but ""their voice.""Cleverly: ""My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads, 'I'm with her.' I choose to recite a different pledge: 'I'm with you, the American people.'""It was not an eloquent speech, not lofty, very plain and blunt. It covered a lot of territory and went too long. It had no leavening humor. It is strange to see a New Yorker so uninterested in wit. It was at points too hyped and declarative, and it was sometimes grandiose.But it was powerful. After reading a copy of the speech leaked in advance, an anti-Trump conservative intellectual emailed me. ""He's going to win,"" he said. The moment at least was not unknowable to him.Credit: By Peggy Noonan",10/4/16
"At Bridge Tables, 'No Trump!' Takes On a New Meaning --- Traditional game lingo loses neutrality as some players inject politics",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806204294?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsThe American Contract Bridge League is the governing body for the card game in North America. A Page One article Saturday about the term ""no trump"" taking on new meaning in the game incorrectly referred to the group as the American Contract Bridge Association.(WSJ July 25, 2016)At gatherings of the Glenshaw Duplicate Bridge Club outside of Pittsburgh, players sip soft drinks in the social hall of a Presbyterian church and chat quietly between hands. Mainly they avoid small talk, especially politics, once the cards are on the table.But lately, partisanship has crept into the deck.""No trump!"" said a player at one recent event, using game-speak to request that a hand begin without a trump suit. In this particular utterance, though, the player's tone suggested he was also referring to the Republican presidential nominee.John Bernhard, who directs five bridge clubs around the city, didn't catch who made the comment. ""It was obviously a liberal,"" he said. ""No one threw any punches. I'm a Trump supporter, but I'm like a Buddhist; I detach.""Donald Trump, known for his brash political style, is now roiling the quiet world of contract bridge -- where trump suits, which carry more weight than others in a given hand, are an integral part of play.A few bridge fans have even appealed to governing authorities to replace the timeworn term to avoid political connotations.At the Oaxaca Bridge Club in Mexico, where many of the players are either U.S. or Canadian expats, ""no trump"" bids are a badge of pride.""We do it with gusto,"" said Barbara Perez, the director of the club in the town about 800 miles south of the U.S. border, where Mr. Trump's proposal to build an anti-immigration wall is far from popular.On the flip side, such jokes aren't welcome at the Whitford Country Club in the Philadelphia suburb of Exton.""You're not likely to hear 'no trump' puns here,"" said Susan Shenkin, noting a strong anti-Clinton bent in the group. ""People kind of assume everybody else is on the same page.""Bridge, a contest of strategy and finesse, likely evolved from an older card game called Whist in the 1800s, according to games historian David Parlett. The modern form of bridge was developed by Harold Vanderbilt in 1929.The term ""trump"" stretches back even further, with roots in the 15th century, said Mr. Parlett, and is thought to be semantically related to the word ""triumph.""Today, organized games are played around the U.S. at homes, church basements, recreation centers and country clubs. There's also a healthy tournament circuit. Many players are retirees; fans include the likes of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.Representatives for both Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and Mr. Trump declined to comment on the bridge-table controversy.""The word 'trump' has been part of bridge's vernacular long before Donald Trump was even a twinkle in his parent's eye. And it will be around long after he is gone,"" said Darbi Padbury, spokeswoman for the American Contract Bridge Association.In bridge, players go around the table and try to get their preferred suit as trump for that hand -- part of a process known as bidding. Each player also has the chance to declare ""no trump"" in hopes of making all four suits equal.At the Beverly Hills Bridge Club, someone hung a recent New Yorker cartoon depicting four players at a table. The caption reads: ""One no-trump. Oh, please, God, no Trump.""""I think everyone looked at it and laughed a little bit,"" said Om Chokriwala, a manager of the club.At the recent Flying Pig Regional bridge tournament in Cincinnati, a vendor had a new offering: a jaunty hat declaring ""No Trump"" in big letters accompanied by the four suits in a deck of cards.""They sell like hot cakes,"" said club director A.J. Stephani -- though he acknowledged that he and others felt the hats crossed a line.""What brings us together is love of the game. You have to keep politics out,"" he said.The hat salesman, Brett Butterman, of West Palm Beach, Fla., said he is used to taking flak from Trump supporters.A company that makes bridge markers, a sign that reminds players of the suit for each hand, is playing both sides of the aisle. It offers markers that say ""No Clinton,"" instead of ""No Trump"" and another one that says ""Vote Clinton, No Trump,"" said James Esteph, owner of Newt's Playing Cards in Circleville, Ohio.""So far, the 'No Clinton' ones are winning, but only by a few,"" Mr. Esteph said.A few members of the American Contract Bridge League have even written in to demand the organizations drop the use of the word ""trump,"" said Paul Linxwiler, editor of the group's magazine, ""Bridge Bulletin.""Mostly, though, Mr. Linxwiler says he gets unsolicited jokes and cartoons from members. Riffling through a stack to find a funny one, he is disappointed.""If you have a heart, bid no trump,"" he read. ""Everybody thinks they're a comedian.""Credit: By Ben Kesling and Beckie Strum",10/4/16
"Trump Celebrates, But Feud Simmers",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806204196?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- A satisfied Donald Trump celebrated ""one of the most love-filled conventions in the history of conventions"" on Friday, and then he capped the week of his Republican presidential nomination by reopening one of the week's most contentious moments: his feud with primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz.Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Cruz for failing to endorse him after being granted a prime speaking slot at the convention this week. ""I don't want his endorsement,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If he gives it, I won't accept.""With emphasis on immigration, crime and ""America first"" policies in trade and foreign policy, Mr. Trump's acceptance speech and overall convention program echoed the signature messages that have brought people to his campaign. Quick survey and poll results brought positive news for Mr. Trump.An instant CNN/ORC poll found that 56% of those viewing the speech said they would be more likely to vote for Mr. Trump, 10% said it made them less likely to vote for him, and 32% said it had little effect.In a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken over the course of the Republican convention, Mr. Trump pulled closer to Democrat Hillary Clinton. The July 18-22 national online poll found that 41% of likely voters supported Mrs. Clinton, while 38% supported Mr. Trump, with a margin of error of about 4 percentage points. On Monday, he trailed her by nearly 10 percentage points in the poll.Traditionally, parties and their presidential nominees take their national conventions as an opportunity to turn from the primary-season focus on their own party to an effort to address a broader audience of independents and swing voters who will be needed to win a general election.There were some efforts to do that at the GOP gathering by nodding to groups that haven't been Republican regulars: Mr. Trump's acceptance speech called for protecting the gay, lesbian and transgender community from intolerance and terrorism, and he commented that he was glad to hear the GOP audience applaud his remarks. Technology executive Peter Thiel took the podium and noted he was the first openly gay Republican to speak to a GOP convention.The speech beforehand by Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka was designed mainly to address women and counter accusations that her father demeans them. And she introduced herself as a millennial who, like about half of her generation, doesn't identify solely with either party.Initial reactions suggested Mr. Trump made little progress with gay community leaders. The Human Rights Campaign said that ""Donald Trump appallingly feigned support for LGBTQ people after opposing equality at every turn.""Far more of the convention's program, and most of Mr. Trump's speech, appeared designed to shore up his base. That may have been a strategy born of necessity, in light of divisions within the party.""It wasn't a speech that was uplifting, but Trump's never been about that,"" said Doug Heye, a former aide to House GOP leaders who has said he wouldn't vote for Mr. Trump. ""It was a speech still aimed at the base -- not at trying to build a broader coalition of voters, but again that's not something Trump has ever tried to do.""Trump supporters argue that he doesn't need a new message tailored to attracting new voters. ""The key to appealing to the potential new voters to put you over the top is not to be more milquetoast and more moderate,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an early Trump backer. ""So what he did was show strength: 'I understand you, I'm on your side.' And I think that message will resonate until November. It's going to get stronger, and I'm pretty confident that his vote total will grow.""Even some who aren't sold on Mr. Trump said the approach was smart. ""Trump has cleverly positioned himself as the candidate of change, versus Clinton as the puppet of the status quo,"""" said Scott Reed, political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who has been skeptical of Mr. Trump. ""Watch for a healthy bump in the battleground-state polls.""Mrs. Clinton, speaking in Florida on Friday, strongly objected to the theme of Mr. Trump's speech that he would speak for working people and the downtrodden. ""Last night, Donald told us 'I am your voice,'"" said Mrs, Clinton. ""Well, I don't think he speaks for most Americans, do you? . . . Contrary to what they tried to say at their convention, I don't think he speaks for women.""Analysts from both parties will be watching closely to see how much and how lasting a bump in the polls Mr. Trump might get -- and whether it moves swing voters.John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics who conducted a town hall meeting with young people in Cleveland during the convention, said that Ivanka Trump was very appealing to young voters, but that her message of inclusion was overshadowed by her father's speech.""Some of the good will created by her speech might have been lost, or at least not extended,"" by the nominee's acceptance speech that followed, Mr. Della Volpe said.Some Republicans saw the greatest risk in the paucity of outreach to Hispanics, a fast-growing part of the electorate that GOP leaders want to court to bolster the party's future, but who have been particularly negative about Mr. Trump because of his anti-immigrant message.""As a Hispanic, I didn't like what I heard,"" said Al Cardenas, former president of the American Conservative Union, who had supported Trump rival Jeb Bush. ""If you were expecting him to pivot and cast a wider net going into the general election, you were wrong. I don't see how he gets enough people to follow him on such a narrow path.""Mr. Trump's morning-after attack on Mr. Cruz also renewed one of the most bizarre issues of the primary campaign, returning to allegations made in the National Enquirer tabloid that Mr. Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, was linked to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.---Beth Reinhard, Reid J. Epstein and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook and Heather Haddon",10/4/16
Why Peter Thiel Really Supports Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806204184?accountid=12768,"For a Trumpian nonbeliever, the most interesting speech of four days was always going to be technology superinvestor Peter Thiel's.The Silicon Valley wunderkind and early Facebook backer is known for his singular diagnosis of American ills. The undersea cities, flying cars and three-star restaurants on Mars we promised ourselves in the optimistic early '60s haven't materialized. Outside of infotech, the rate of American innovation and progress is very much less than we like to tell ourselves it is. In the world of bits, deregulated entrepreneurialism prevails. In the world of atoms, not so much, thanks to overregulation and politicized risk aversion.Six years ago, Mr. Thiel explained why this was a disaster for Americans: ""In a world where wealth is growing, you can get away with printing money . . . . In the '30s, the Keynesian stuff worked at least in the sense that you could print money without inflation because there was all this productivity growth happening."" In today's world where technology is failing, printing money is ""not going to work"" and ""you probably have to get rid of the welfare state.""Mr. Thiel at the time foresaw a ""grim Malthusian politics,"" a period of ""long-term stagnation,"" leading to a ""near revolutionary situation"" in the U.S. It's a view (increasingly shared by secular stagnation theorists) that he has continued to elaborate in speeches and interviews ever since.So if Mr. Thiel this week gave himself the job of speaking for a candidate whom many of his Silicon Valley friends and peers frankly revile, one readily supposes the reasoning went like this: The Valley sees Trump as anti-trade, anti-immigration, and nothing in Mr. Thiel's speech suggested Mr. Thiel is anti-trade, anti-immigration. But Mr. Trump is a wrecking ball at a time when Washington needs a wrecking ball. It needs a candidate whose very existence forcibly disrupts its ways and patterns.Even Mr. Trump's vulgarities, his reprehensible impulses (kill the innocent family members of terrorists), his dangerous suggestions (decide when the time comes whether to uphold NATO's guarantee of the Baltics) might seem virtues, in a sense. They expand the boundaries of the sayable.Of course, making so counterintuitive a case in a convention speech isn't practical, especially when doing extra duty as a representative of gay outreach. So Mr. Thiel contented himself with saying that he supported Mr. Trump because Mr. Trump ""is a builder."" He harked back to the 1960s, when government was competent -- it got us to the moon in less time and for less money than it takes today to repair a bridge. Every industrial city was a Silicon Valley, because businesses everywhere were innovating and investing. We need to recover that spirit. Today's fights about gender-bathroom assignment are a distraction. ""Who cares!""You had to know where Mr. Thiel was coming from to know where he was going with his support of Mr. Trump. Few voters did. Yet the job Mr. Thiel gave himself is an important one. The Republican convention has now wrapped up. Those immune to histrionics and heavy breathing have only one question: Will Mr. Trump mount a fall campaign equal to the task of returning a Republican majority to both houses of Congress?Even voters sensitive to the many ways that Donald Trump has given lip to an agenda that likely would do more harm than good can see him as a gift of providence. He's here to scare the bejesus out of the establishment.Mr. Trump fulfills this role even if he loses by a smidgen to Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton and the GOP House and Senate leadership of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell will be left acknowledging a near-run thing. Mrs. Clinton will have no second term, no legacy; Mr. Ryan will have no hope of the presidency; Mr. McConnell will finally fall to the Tea Party types who have been gunning for him so long -- unless they make the deals that begin America's renewal.Mr. Trump's own speech, give him credit, was a masterful if lengthy exposition of his nationalist-Peronist viewpoint: America is a nation of lovely people of every creed, ethnicity and sexual orientation beset by murderous illegal aliens, Islamic terrorists and the predatory trade practices of other countries.At least gone was the impractical and dangerous idea of rounding up 11 million illegals and deporting them (instead Mr. Trump would slow new arrivals to a trickle). In every other way, Mr. Trump sticks to a diagnosis that blames non-Americans for America's problems. We wait to find out how this plays with the American voter. Politically, Mr. Trump piles his chips on a high-risk, all-or-nothing gamble. He seeks to ignite a populist prairie fire that will burn a path to the White House. He does not engage in the tactical (and expensive, media-wise) base broadening that most presidential campaigns engage in.All or nothing, of course, is also the Trump strategy most likely to end with a Hillary landslide, with Democrats inheriting all three branches and trying to cure America's malaise with bigger government and more redistribution. If Mr. Thiel aligns himself with a handful of base-expanding Wall Streeters who also have endorsed Mr. Trump as a blower-upper of the status quo, this fear is probably partly why.Credit: By Holman W.

City News: Students for Trump Stick Together,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804814471?accountid=12768,"Vassar College economics student Ian Vasily cuts an unusual figure walking through campus in a hat bearing Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""Many students at the upstate New York school ask:""'Are you actually supporting him?' "" Mr. Vasily said, "" 'Or is this ironic?'""At liberal-arts colleges in the Northeast and on many campuses nationwide, where left-wing activism often flourishes, there is little love lost between the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and student bodies.But a phenomenon has sprung up at these schools, too -- the lonely Trump supporter waging a solitary battle and seeking like-minded peers in the shadows.From Yale University to New York University, students donning Trump gear across campus quads attract attention, if not hostilities, and spark debates.While sipping a milkshake on campus in his hat, Mr. Vasily faced questions from a student passerby about whether he thought some of Mr. Trump's comments were racist.""Generally people are more curious than anything else because it's such an oddity,"" said Mr. Vasily, 19 years old.At Yale, philosophy student Karl Notturno is one of the few out-and-proud backers of the Republican candidate on the Connecticut campus, which, he said, has become his claim to fame. ""I'm kind of known as 'The Trump Supporter,'"" he said.Mr. Notturno, 21, said he has found fellow Trump voters while conducting his own informal polling, but ""a lot of them are quiet about it, because it's a very, very unpopular opinion. It's not the type of thing you'd voluntarily disclose.""While Mr. Trump has found a well of support in red state and Evangelical campuses, the New York businessman remains largely unpopular on college campuses in blue states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. According to a poll this spring of 3,183 voters under 30 from the Institute of Politics at Harvard University, 61% prefer presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump.At some New York colleges, campus GOP clubs have been riven by Mr. Trump's candidacy, mirroring the divide among GOP lawmakers in Washington.Students at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., treat active members of the campus Republican club -- all five of them -- ""even less seriously than they did before"" because of Mr. Trump's candidacy, said Elizabeth Barry, a member of the club.At Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., when ""Make America Great Again"" was scrawled on two faculty members' dry-erase boards, a campus panel tasked with investigating alleged acts of prejudice labeled it a bias attack. Both faculty members were racial minorities. The person responsible for the writing wasn't identified.A spokeswoman for Skidmore said Mr. Trump's slogan ""is in its own right protected political speech"" but when particular individuals are targeted ""it may take it out of that realm and raise different concerns about its purpose.""Some of Mr. Trump's backers described doing underground networking to find like-minded peers. Mr. Vasily said he found one supporter of Mr. Trump at Vassar through an app that allows students to gossip anonymously about one another.Some students were criticizing a fellow Vassar student for holding pro-Trump views, and Mr. Vasily and other campus conservatives tracked him down.Students with conservative views have long complained about feeling isolated on college campuses. Dylan Perera, a bespectacled NYU student, found a burst of right-wing celebrity after he revealed he supported Mr. Trump in a New York Post article about students at the school who were afraid to show they were Trump backers. Mr. Perera made the rounds on talk shows and blogs earlier this year.He declined to comment for this article because he said he is in talks about an internship with Mr. Trump's campaign.Their liberal peers say the fears are overblown. ""It actually tends to be those that are more liberal -- particularly minorities and urban youths -- who are truly threatened on a day-to-day basis,"" said Michael DeLuca, 21, president of the NYU College Democrats.At Columbia University, 22-year-old Eric Steven Wimer, who identifies as a ""leftist,"" said he didn't know of a single Trump supporter at the school of 30,000 students. ""The fact that we can't find any of them means they're probably hiding,"" he said.Credit: By Mike Vilensky and Zolan Kanno-Youngs",10/4/16
Cleveland Set for a Trump Show,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804814430?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- Republicans gathered here to elevate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate and party leader, an outcome almost no one among the GOP's leadership saw coming at the campaign's outset.The convention that begins Monday will, in some ways, be as unorthodox as the process that led to it. Trump aides say they hope to use it to showcase the New York developer as not merely the slashing political figure Americans saw in the primary debates, but as an accomplished business leader and a family man.Toward that end, the television spectacle this week will be more heavily focused on the first-time candidate rather than the party around him. A member of the Trump family -- three adult children and his wife -- will each be featured on one of the convention's four nights, as will those who have known him personally in multiple walks of life.The tenor of the gathering now figures to be affected by a series of shocking news events in recent days. The killing of five police officers in Dallas and Sunday's killing of three in Louisiana have led Mr. Trump and his newly minted running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, to declare themselves the ""law and order"" candidates.Those messages, however, could be undermined by rowdy street protests by both supporters and opponents of Mr. Trump that are expected to attract thousands, including some who have vowed to take advantage of Ohio's law allowing them to openly carry firearms.Recasting and broadening Mr. Trump's image, a key convention goal for the campaign, is critical because he begins the general election against expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton behind. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News national poll shows him trailing Mrs. Clinton, whose convention will be held next week in Philadelphia, by a 46%-to-41% margin.The survey also shows that Mr. Trump has a lot of work to do this week uniting the party behind him.Few Republicans -- 13% -- see their party as unified, and just 38% say they are satisfied with Mr. Trump as the party's nominee. Dozens of high-profile party officials -- senators and former presidents -- have refused to attend the convention because they oppose the New York businessman.The survey was done before the announcement of Mr. Pence as the GOP running mate, a pick that was specifically aimed at uniting the party. The governor is a favorite of the party's evangelical Christian base and is a former member of Congress popular with many lawmakers.In a joint interview with Mr. Pence on CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" Mr. Trump said of his running mate, ""Having Governor Mike Pence has really -- people that I wasn't necessarily liking or getting along are loving this pick, because they have such respect for him.""The national conventions give both parties and their presidential nominees a chance to address not just their supporters but a wider audience of Americans, many of them sour on politics. The GOP has the bigger public-relations problem, the latest WSJ/NBC News poll found: Just 27% of registered voters have a positive view of the Republican Party, compared with 39% who view the Democratic Party favorably.Still, Mr. Trump is holding his own in a race where, according to the poll, a majority of voters wants a candidate who brings ""major changes"" to government rather than a ""steady approach.""""Donald Trump is a phenomenon we have never seen in American politics,"" said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who worked on the survey with GOP pollster Bill McInturff. ""In an election of change, Donald Trump would be a favorite. But he is the chaos candidate, and that is likely to nullify the advantage he has.""The conventions are meeting after several weeks of great tumult at home and abroad, including federal officials' conclusion that Mrs. Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in handling sensitive government emails, gun violence, racial tensions, and, with the massacre in Nice, France, heightened fears of international terrorism.Still, the poll found one pillar of stability in U.S. politics: Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton remain the two most unpopular people in modern times to be major-party presidential nominees.Tammy Kirkiewicz, a 51-year-old in St. Louis, said she was backing Mr. Trump mostly because he is the alternative to Mrs. Clinton. ""I'm not sure that he's the one; he's sort of a loose cannon,"" she said. ""But if that's the only option, it's better than Hillary.""Asked which candidate showed the right judgment to be a good president, 37% said Mrs. Clinton, and 25% said Mr. Trump. But 32% said neither candidate -- a huge difference from 2008, when only 6% said that neither Barack Obama nor John McCain had the right judgment.""Let me summarize the poll in four little words: They hate them both,"" said Fred Yang, another Democratic pollster who conducted the survey.Mrs. Clinton continued to lead Mr. Trump when third-party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party, were added to the mix.In that lineup, Mrs. Clinton draws 41% of the vote, Mr. Trump 35%, Mr. Johnson 11% and Ms. Stein 6%.The poll identified other factors that could redound to her benefit. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump among Hispanic registered voters by a whopping 76% to 14%, meaning the Republican trails the 27% of Hispanic voters won by Mitt Romney in 2012.Meanwhile, more voters say they want a Democrat to be president than a Republican. Mr. Obama's job performance wins approval from 51% of voters for the third straight month. A growing share says the economy has improved and that Mr. Obama deserves credit.Still, the poll found that the FBI report on Mrs. Clinton's email practices is casting a long shadow over voters' view of her.Fully 55% of those surveyed said her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state was an ""important factor"" in deciding whether to vote for her.At the same time, a plurality of 43% said they believed the FBI investigation was ""unfair and too partisan.""William Reeves, 34, a Clinton supporter in Tampa, Fla., said Mrs. Clinton probably should have met punishment for her email use. But the matter wasn't enough to deter him from voting for her.""When it becomes a choice between Hillary Clinton's proven track record and a complete nobody . . . it's a pretty clear, easy choice,"" Mr. Reeves said.Credit: By Janet Hook",10/4/16
The Republican Convention: Rules Fight Is Set to End Quietly --- Anti-Trump movement fails to secure support for unbinding measure from top party officials,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804814181?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- What might have been a disruptive fight about the party's rules and platform is now almost certain to end with a whimper when the Republican National Convention opens for businesson Monday.The rules fight, in the works for months as the Ted Cruz campaign worked to install the Texan's supporters on key committees, fizzled last week as Donald Trump's backers allied with key officials from the Republican National Committee to crush the anti-Trump faction.The only remaining drama will come when bands of renegade delegates try to slow the convention proceedings through a series of procedural maneuvers that are likely to fail -- just as the effort to block Donald Trump from becoming the party's presidential nominee did last week.Mr. Trump's opponents will seek a recorded roll-call vote by each state's delegation on the rules adopted in a marathon Rules Committee session last week.Organizers of the anti-Trump movement recognize their odds are slim but they expect the cause to live on.""This is something that doesn't rise and fall at what happens here in Cleveland,"" Dane Waters, a leader of the unbinding effort, said Sunday. ""They've riled up the base"" in a way that could produce ""longtime positive reform in reviving the Republican Party.""RNC chairman Reince Priebus said the renegade delegates won't succeed in delaying the convention or unbinding delegates.""I don't think they're going to be successful,"" he said in aSunday interview on ABC.Along with the effort to unseat Mr. Trump as the nominee, a faction of delegates loyal to Mr. Cruz continues to seek a conventionwide vote on a series of measures designed to help future conservative candidates in presidential contests.The Cruz delegates want to ban corporate lobbyists from serving on the RNC, provide a 20% delegate bonus to states that forbid Democrats and independents from participating in their primaries and caucuses, award more delegates to states with more Republican members of Congress and strip power from the RNC chairman.All of their proposals failed last week in the convention committee.In aFridaynight conference call, former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who is leading the Cruz backers on the Rules Committee, promised to pursue a ""minority report,"" which would require agreement from at least 28 of the 112 committee members. That number would allow Mr. Cuccinelli to force the entire convention to vote on the pro-Cruz measures.""You can expect to see that this isn't done. It isn't over,"" Mr. Cuccinelli said. ""If there was some notion on the part of the party or the Trump campaign that they wanted unity in this convention, it is an odd way to do it to kick the grass-roots in the teeth.""In a Friday interview in Cleveland, Mr. Cruz, a Texas Senator, declined to explicitly criticize the Rules Committee but backed Mr. Cuccinelli's proposals. ""I think a great many of us would like to see Republican nominees chosen by Republicans,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""There are certainly common sense reforms that could be enacted to ensure that happens. But that's for the delegates to make those decisions.""A fight promised last week concerning social-issues language in the party's platform also appears to have fizzled in recent days.Giovani Cicione of Rhode Island on Wednesday said he had commitments from enough members of the Platform Committee to back a full-convention vote to replace the 60-page platform, which takes a harsh stance on gay marriage, with a two-page document that avoids mention of it.Jim Bopp, a Republican National Committee member from Indiana, who whipped votes against the alternative plan, said he had convinced many to rescind their support for the two-page document.""That effort is dead,"" Mr. Bopp said Sunday.Credit: By Reid J.

Before Mr. de Blasio won election in 2013, the city elected the GOP mayoral nominee five times. Mr. de Blasio's predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, was a lifelong Democrat who changed parties before running for City Hall; he is now unaffiliated with any party.Asked whether the Trump children might have a shot at becoming mayor, Ed Cox, chairman of the New York state Republican Party, laughed. ""I'm sure it's nothing they're concerned about right now, nor should they be,"" he said.Nicholas Kokkinis, 25, a registered Democrat in Manhattan, said the Trump children represented much of what is wrong with America and would be riding on their father's coattails.""I pretty much detest the Trump brand name,"" he said.

Clinton Foundation Amends Its Filing With New York; Move comes day after rival Donald Trump's charitable foundation was told to suspend fundraising in state,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825687402?accountid=12768,"Officials at the foundation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said they filed information Tuesday with the New York attorney general's office that was missing from previous disclosures.The move comes a day after Republican rival Donald Trump's charitable foundation was told to suspend its fundraising in the state because it violated registration requirements.A Clinton Foundation spokesman said the charity has complied with New York law, but amended its annual charitable filing with the office of Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, ""out of an abundance of caution."" The group said it would disclose more detailed financial data on its affiliates.A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said the foundation's filings for at least one year--in 2012--were incomplete. After the foundation submitted the additional information on Tuesday, the attorney general's office made it public, showing a more complete breakdown of annual revenues, expenses and liabilities for the foundation and its related entities, including foreign affiliates.The foundation's move comes as presidential contenders' philanthropic ventures have come under scrutiny.Mrs. Clinton's political rivals have questioned the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign government donations, including some that came during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton has denied any conflicts of interest and said she is proud of the foundation's work.Mr. Schneiderman's office said Monday it is demanding that Donald Trump's charitable foundation suspend fundraising activity in New York, issuing a cease-and-desist letter accusing Mr. Trump's family nonprofit of failing to register as a charity that raises money in the state.The foundation has 15 days from Sept. 30--the day the notice was dated--to correct its registration and file required paperwork.A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said the candidate questioned the political motives of Mr. Schneiderman, who supports Mrs. Clinton, and said the foundation would comply with Mr. Schneiderman's broader investigation into the charity.The Clinton Foundation has offered to share more details with Mr. Schneiderman's bureau about contributions from foreign governments. But a spokesman for the foundation said it hasn't received a request to do so from Mr. Schneiderman's office.New York requires that charitable organizations annually disclose and itemize the dollar amounts of grants made by a ""government agency.""The attorney general and the Clinton Foundation said they are currently interpreting that rule to be limited to grants from domestic government sources.The foundation in recent years has disclosed to New York officials its foreign government grants as a lump sum. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, the foundation's largest project, also makes annual financial disclosures to the attorney general, but neither itemizes its foreign government grants nor specifies a summary total dollar figure, a practice scrutinized in a Scripps News report from September.""CHAI also received foreign government contributions and can provide those in more details if needed,"" the group told the attorney general's office in a letter accompanying its most recent annual filing.Mr. Schneiderman's office says it has never demanded itemization of foreign government grants, but has said it is considering clarifying its requirements.Some foundations and charities have itemized foreign government grants in recent annual tax filings, including Family Care International, Action Against Hunger and the George W. Bush Foundation, which reported a $5 million grant from the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia in its 2013 filing.Write to James Grimaldi at James.Grimaldi@wsj.com and Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.comCredit: By James V.

The Apology of Donald J. Trump; To those who don't get why Clinton isn't ahead by 50 points--here's the answer.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1825302352?accountid=12768,"What follows is a draft of a speech Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver Tuesday, Oct. 4 in Prescott Valley, Ariz. We haven't confirmed its authenticity because, like the rest of the corrupt media, we're totally dishonest.Thank you, everybody, thank you. It's good to be back in Arizona. And you know we're going to win, right? The polls say we're going to win in Arizona, and we will.The polls also say we'd lose the general election if it were held today. But they're wrong. So wrong. You know how pollsters work? They guess who will show up to vote on election day, and then they poll these ""likely voters.""But let me tell you something. The pollsters have no clue. None. They don't have a clue who the electorate is, and they don't have a clue of what's going on in America. Believe me, folks, on election day they're going to find out.The other day, in Colombia--I'm talking about the country in South America--they held a vote. A referendum. President Santos staked his reputation on a, quote-unquote, peace deal with the terrorists of the FARC.Now the FARC, they're the worst people in the world. They've killed tens of thousands of people. They make their money through drug trafficking and kidnapping. They've been terrorizing Colombians for 50 years.Along comes Santos, and he makes this terrible deal that says to the FARC: We're not going to send you to jail. We're going to sentence your leaders to community service. We're even going to guarantee you seats in the Congress.And all the polls said the deal was going to win in a landslide. Obama and Kerry lined up behind it. Santos told Colombians they had no choice, that it was the only road to peace.Guess what? The polls were wrong. The Colombians knew a bad deal when they saw one. They weren't going to let killers get away with their crimes. The only deal they want with the FARC is the same deal Reagan got from Russia: We win, they lose.Folks, it was the same story with the Brexit vote in June. All the polls said the Brits wouldn't vote to leave the European Union. They did. All the experts said the sky would fall if the Brits voted to go. It didn't. These geniuses said that Britain was too small to be the master of its own destiny. The British people believe otherwise, and I'm with them!What happened in Britain, in Colombia, it's going to happen here. Because, like them, we're sick of it.We're sick of hearing ObamaCare is working when even the New York Times admits it's a total disaster. We're sick of hearing how great the economy is when it's floating on a big wave of cheap credit that benefits Wall Street at the expense of savers. We're sick of hearing how great the Iran deal is, then watching our sailors being humiliated while we secretly fork over pallets of cash.You know what we're also sick of? Liberal hypocrites.I'm not supposed to say the name I'm about to say. Well, two words: Alicia. Machado.Who is this Alicia Machado, other than a political prop for Hillary? She was a beauty queen for a business I helped run called ""Miss Universe."" The business of beauty queens is to be beautiful, just like it's the business of athletes to be fit. Duh! And when she gained some weight, I insisted she lose it. Did I call her ""Miss Piggy""? Boo hoo. Get over it.For this I'm being treated very badly. Let me ask you something: Other than Lena Dunham, when was the last time Anna Wintour ran a fat person on the cover of Vogue? And when was the last time Hillary said no to one of Ms. Wintour's big fundraisers because of Vogue's ""lookism""?So spare me the sensitivity lectures. Spare me the business lectures, too. Those tax returns someone stole and the New York Times published? The ones that showed I once lost nearly a billion dollars and used every legal trick in the book to stage a comeback?All of you here understand this is how business is done in America. Some years you make money. Some years you lose. You take advantage of every tax break you can because the government is trying to screw you every other way.That's the real world. It's only in the unreal world that Hillary lives in that you can make a fortune by being a failed secretary of state and then cash in on obscene speaking fees, or arrange for Bill to get an $18 million salary to be ""honorary chancellor"" at a for-profit college while the Obama administration destroys every other for-profit. That's called corruption, no matter whether it's legal or not.Folks, there's a giant wave coming. A tsunami of Americans who won't stand for being told we don't know what's good for us. Who refuse to be lectured by political grifters about how to make an honest buck. Who don't need our morals improved by Hillary Macbeth and Billy Caligula. And who refuse to accept that we have to make lousy deals, or make do with less, or that America can't ever be great again.To all the liberals and Never Trumpers who don't get why Hillary isn't ahead by 50 points--I just explained it. To all of you, get ready for Nov. 8. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Believe me.Write bstephens@wsj.com.Credit: By Bret Stephens",10/5/16
REVIEW --- The Trump Before Trump --- There are lessons for today's GOP in the ill-fated populist insurgency of William Jennings Bryan,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1804472908?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsPresident McKinley was assassinated in 1901. A July 16 Review cover essay about William Jennings Bryan incorrectly said McKinley was killed in 1900.(WSJ August 1, 2016)Underfinanced, thinly organized and reviled in the media, the Trump campaign has nonetheless apparently pulled even in some recent polls with Hillary Clinton. Every pundit can itemize the long list of things that Donald Trump has done all wrong throughout this election season -- and yet here he is, poised to overcome all dissent at the Republican convention in Cleveland and to run a competitive race afterward.Trump's first and strongest advocate in conservative media, the columnist Ann Coulter, has vividly described the radicalism of what has happened: ""Trump isn't a standard-issue GOP, trying to balance the ticket to get his party into power. He's starting a new party! He's just blown up the old GOP.""Dazed and baffled, the old GOP is still struggling to understand how it has reached this point. One way to understand the situation is to look at an unexpected historical parallel: the populist insurgency led by William Jennings Bryan, who was three times -- in 1896, 1900 and 1908 -- the Democratic Party's candidate for president.As individuals, the gaudy businessman from New York City and the Great Commoner from the prairies don't have much in common. But the political movements that they have championed do share much in common -- both on the way up and, perhaps, on the way down.Both men championed constituencies that formerly occupied a position of cultural and political dominance: small farmers in Bryan's case, the white working class in Trump's. Both of those constituencies had been economically ravaged for years beforehand: by 20 years of price deflation for the small farmers, by a generation of declining wages for the white working class.Both men used their communication skills to upend well-established political hierarchies. In 1896, when Bryan won his first presidential nomination, he had just lost a Senate race after serving a mere two terms in the House of Representatives. He was only 36, but his gorgeously theatrical oratory captured the imagination of Democratic audiences, who seethed against the conservative economic policies imposed by a Democratic president, Grover Cleveland. Likewise for Trump, who has defied his party's consensus on foreign and domestic policy and profited from rank-and-file disgust with an outdated party leadership.Both candidates came to prominence in times of anger and anxiety. In 1893, the U.S. had plunged into the worst depression in its history to date. In 2016, the U.S. is still struggling to recover from a financial crisis almost a decade old.Both articulated a critique of an economic system that seemed to favor a powerful and influential few against the exploited many. Both offered exciting, easy-to-understand solutions: in Bryan's case, replacing the country's de facto gold standard with the bimetallic silver and gold standard of pre-Civil War days; in Trump's, immigration restriction plus trade protection. (Bryan also urged freer trade, with an income tax to replace the revenues from tariffs, and stricter regulation of railways and other corporations.)Both men joined their economic ideas to a cultural message that appalled and frightened their political opponents. Bryan disdained the new urban America: ""Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms, and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country."" Bryan led a party that defined and applied its Jeffersonian ideals for white people only. Trump -- well, we all know about that.Both men horrified elites. Bryan's advocacy of an income tax appalled the Republicans of the 1890s, who equated ""Bryanism"" with anarchism and communism. The rising New York politician Theodore Roosevelt earned a job in the next Republican administration by his bloodcurdling denunciations of Bryan's radicalism. As for Trump's perceived dangerousness, just consider the world-historical malefactors to whom he is routinely compared.Both men sought the leadership of political parties on the decline. Democrats had won six of the nine presidential elections from 1828 until the Civil War, but only two of the seven between Appomattox and Bryan's rise. The Republicans -- well, again, we all know about their recent failures at the presidential level.Both men promised to renew their party by deepening its hold on its core constituency. In the depression of the 1890s, the worst in American history until the 1930s, farmers across the South and West had been lured to new populist third parties and independent political movements. Bryan promised to re-establish Democratic ascendancy by winning them back. Trump has prophesied that he would win ""millions and millions"" of new voters, including blacks and Latinos, with his ""make America great again"" message.Bryan actually kept his promise, recovering for the Democrats more than a million voters who had opted for the Populist and Prohibition parties in 1892. But his achievement came at the price of writing off the industrial states, including traditional Democratic strongholds like New Jersey and Indiana. Trump -- well, that one none of us knows, but this week's more promising polls represent a rare deviation from a long string of ominous survey results for a Trump-led GOP.In the aftermath of Bryan's defeat is found the most urgently relevant comparison between the two candidacies. Bryan personally emerged from 1896 a party hero and martyr. He would win two more Democratic nominations and serve as secretary of state in the first Wilson administration, ending his career as a pitchman for Florida real estate.But the small farmers who looked to him for rescue were politically ruined by his candidacy. Their party would turn its back on their issues, desperately retooling itself in an effort to appeal to voters in the industrial Midwest and North. The post-1896 Democrats made their peace with the gold standard, which was enacted into law in 1900. Henceforth, it would be the factory worker -- not the small farmer -- whom they most strenuously sought to protect from the excesses of industrial capitalism.Not until the New Deal would Democrats again put agricultural issues at the center of their program. By then, the small farmers were a broken and bankrupt social class, recipients of compassion and charity from a Democratic Party now strongly based in the ethnically and religiously heterogeneous urban America that had so frightened William Jennings Bryan.The great irony of 1896 was that Bryan was more right than wrong about his central issues. Milton Friedman convincingly argued in his 1992 book ""Money Mischief"" that a bimetallic silver-gold standard would have mitigated or even prevented the post-Civil War price deflation. The deflation crushed farm incomes even as farm debt weighed more onerously. Bryan's other great issue, freer trade, would have enhanced consumer purchasing power at a time when wages were growing slowly.Instead, Bryan's repeated political defeats locked the gold standard and protectionism into place for most of the next 35 years. Though no politician could have preserved the farm society of the 19th century, different policies might have eased the hardships of the transition for rural America. A different champion might have secured different policies.Likewise, Donald Trump is making powerful points, increasingly confirmed by economic research, about the shock to working-class Americans of the trade and immigration policies of the past two decades. Trump has accepted social-insurance programs like Medicare and Social Security more wholeheartedly than any other national Republican in a generation.But Trump has made those winning points in an aggressively inflammatory language that has repelled women, nonwhites and the college-educated. If Trump should go down to the epic defeat that even many in his own party seem to expect, the outcome could reverberate down the ballot. What then would happen to Trump's issues -- and to the concerns of the white working-class voters who put their faith in him?Republican senators are itching to revive the bipartisan Gang of Eight immigration approach of 2013, with its various accommodations of the status quo. The congressional Republican Party remains committed to a fiscal agenda that would cut social insurance to finance big upper-income tax cuts. Though more Republicans are making Trump-like noises about opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the party has shown insufficient interest in what can be done to retrain and re-employ those manufacturing workers who have already lost jobs -- aside, that is, from offering tax cuts to potential employers.In the case of a Trump defeat, surviving Republican officeholders and party leaders will find themselves next year absorbing an amazing result: Their historic base among the better-off and better-educated will have overwhelmingly deserted them. Their yearned-for growth in support among more affluent and ambitious nonwhites will have receded still further away. And their newly expanded base among angry and alienated downscale whites will have cast votes for a set of policies repugnant to those theoretically tasked with trying to implement them.After November, the outlook of the Republican elite may well be captured by the grim joke told by Bertolt Brecht after the 1953 Berlin uprising: ""Would it not be simpler if the government simply dissolved the people and elected another?"" Like the post-Bryan Democrats who turned for support from Bryan's Protestant countryside to Al Smith's Catholic big cities, the post-Trump Republicans may focus their attention on their lost upmarket and hoped-for minority votes and turn their backs on a working-class base that would be assigned the blame for the 2016 debacle.There would be some fairness in this, but many other culprits are equally or more blameworthy: the right-wing talk-radio hosts and broadcast-media outlets that worked so hard to promote Trump; the self-seeking mainstream candidates who declined to combine against him; the lobbyists and operatives who visibly preferred Trump to Ted Cruz, the last available Republican alternative; the party leaders who invented the orthodoxy of more immigration and less social insurance that has defined the congressional GOP throughout the Obama years -- and so many more. But they are too powerful or too central to the party's institutional identity to be fingered. It will be the voters who take the blame.It is fascinating now to read the legendarily vicious obituary of Bryan written by H.L. Mencken in 1925. In many ways, Mencken's politics aligned with Bryan's. Both had opposed U.S. entry into World War I, for example. But none of that could offset Mencken's contempt for Bryan's voters and Bryan himself for representing them: ""There was something peculiarly fitting in the fact that his last days were spent in a one-horse Tennessee village, beating off the flies and gnats, and that death found him there. The man felt at home in such simple and Christian scenes. He liked people who sweated freely, and were not debauched by the refinements of the toilet.""Mencken's sneers do not make for pleasant reading now. But in 1925, they had members of the self-consciously clever class laughing in much the same smug way that John Oliver makes their moral descendants laugh today at very similar targets.And perhaps the Trump voters set themselves up for it. Trump has duped them with claims so thin and preposterous that it is hard for the unduped to imagine how it could have been done.But do they deserve it? Like Bryan's hard-pressed farmers, the Trump voters are the Americans selected to pay the heaviest cost for the transition from one economic order to another. Not only the heaviest economic cost but the most onerous social cost too: family crackup, addiction, suicide, lost cultural standing, lost political respect, lost deference to their norms and expectations. They have fallen down the stairs. Must the people at the top throw a kick after them?Bryan's first defeat coincided with a surge of internecine conflict in the U.S.: lynchings in the South, murderous labor strife in factory and mining towns, the assassination of President McKinley in 1900, a nearly successful attempt on former President Roosevelt in 1912. Great social and economic transitions are dangerous. Generous and inspired leadership can ease them. We're still waiting for that.---Mr. Frum is a senior editor at the Atlantic and the chairman of the British think tank Policy Exchange. In 2001-02, he was a speechwriter for President George W.

Election 2016: Ginsburg Comments on Trump Draw Criticism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803364247?accountid=12768,"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dislike of the possibility Donald Trump could be president is sparking criticism that she is politicizing the Supreme Court, which already is a central issue in the presidential election.Justice Ginsburg has addressed the presumptive Republican nominee in three recent interviews in which she suggested Mr. Trump would be bad for the court and for the nation. Her remarks -- unusually candid and perhaps unprecedented in modern times -- have prompted debate about whether it is appropriate for a justice to speak directly about an election, particularly one that could have long-lasting consequences for the Supreme Court.""He is a faker,"" Justice Ginsburg said of Mr. Trump during a CNN interview from her chambers late Monday. ""He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.""The CNN comments followed interviews with the New York Times and the Associated Press in which she expressed dread at the possibility of a Trump presidency. ""I can't imagine what this place would be -- I can't imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president,"" Justice Ginsburg said in the Times interview.Justice Ginsburg has a reputation for being more outspoken in public than most of her colleagues, but her comments have prompted unease in legal circles and denunciations from some politicians.The code of conduct for federal judges says that they shouldn't ""publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office."" The code doesn't apply to Supreme Court justices, but they generally are guided by it.""Steering the courts into the political fray is something the code is trying to avoid,"" said Indiana University law professor Charles Geyh.Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Justice Ginsburg's comments ""make the judiciary just as political as the other branches of government, and that's a bad thing.""Mr. Shapiro said Justice Ginsburg could face requests to recuse herself if legal disputes arise out of the November presidential election, and in future cases involving executive actions by Mr. Trump if he were to win the White House.Justice Ginsburg, through a court spokeswoman, declined to comment further. The Trump campaign didn't respond to requests for comment.The next president could shape the direction of the Supreme Court for a generation. Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February left the court evenly split between conservative and liberal justices, and the Senate has declined to consider President Barack Obama's nominee to fill the ninth slot, Judge Merrick Garland, with Republicans saying the nomination should go to the next president.---Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.Credit: By Brent Kendall and Jacob Gershman",10/5/16

But in the interview, on the way to events with Mr. Pence in Indiana, Mr. Trump added a new criterion: He wants an attack dog.""I'm getting attacked from all sides,"" he said.Having a staunch critic of the Democratic ticket would give Mr. Trump room to show he can be presidential, said one person familiar with the situation, rather than attacking his rivals as he did during the primaries.That plays to the strengths of Messrs. Christie and Gingrich, feisty and combative politicians whom Mr. Trump called ""two extraordinary warriors."" Saying that personal chemistry is also important, Mr. Trump said, ""You either have it or you don't. I clearly have it with Chris and Newt.""As for Mr. Pence, who has been rising to the top of the list among political speculators, Mr. Trump said he hasn't seen enough to measure his fighting spirit and their chemistry. That is why Tuesday's events -- a fundraiser and a rally -- may have amounted to a high-profile audition for a role that Mr. Trump is likely to announce at week's end.At Tuesday's Indiana rally, Mr. Pence, in a short speech introducing Mr. Trump, said, ""We are ready to put a fighter, a builder and a patriot in the Oval Office.""Later, Mr. Trump said to the audience: ""How's your governor doing by the way? Good? I think so."" In one other mention of Mr. Pence, he said, ""I don't know if he is going to be your governor or vice president.""Mr. Trump's recent tryouts with prospects have effectively winnowed his field of choices. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee in early July called the job too political for his taste after he spent eight hours with Mr. Trump and appeared at a rally North Carolina. Later that same day, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who had met with Mr. Trump the day before, said she was focused on the Senate.While Mr. Sessions hasn't been a focus of political handicapping, Mr. Trump has hired some of the senator's top aides, and he was among the first lawmakers to endorse the candidate.Other presidential hopefuls have campaigned with potential running mates before picking them, but Mr. Trump's appearances are especially purposeful, coming as they have in the final days before his decision.""A key part of this is 'What's the chemistry?' "" said Mr. Gingrich in an interview. ""Trump is dealing with people he doesn't know. He hasn't been with any of us.""Mr. Gingrich and Fox News said Tuesday that his role as paid contributor on the network was suspended. Randy Evans, Mr. Gingrich's lawyer, said the move was to avoid the ""appearance of impropriety"" while he was on the shortlist.Mr. Gingrich can rev up a crowd and would give Mr. Trump a partner skilled in reaching out to Congress. But the former Georgia congressman also has a long trail of controversies -- he was forced to settle an ethics complaint in the House -- and a knack for being as unpredictable and provocative as Mr. Trump.Mr. Christie, in the latest of many joint appearances with Mr. Trump, introduced the presumptive nominee in Virginia Monday and showed how he would play the traditional running-mate role of attacking the opposition.Mr. Christie could bring to the ticket the experience of having been a governor, with a background in law enforcement. But with his brash personality and northeastern roots, his selection would defy the conventional wisdom that a running mate broaden a nominee's political, regional and personal appeal.The governor also has his own scandal -- the closure of lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge that prosecutors call payback by Christie aides to a Democratic mayor that didn't endorse their boss.A top Christie adviser declined to discuss the matter in detail but confirmed the governor had met Saturday with a top Trump official involved in the final stages of vetting.One Republican strategist called Mr. Pence the ""safest"" choice. He would bring governing experience and ties to the congressional and party establishment, and he has close links to social conservatives.Mr. Pence and his wife, Karen, went to New Jersey this month to spend time with Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania.Credit: By Monica Langley and Janet Hook",10/5/16
WSJ Trump's Party Foes Mounting Last Drive,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803263282?accountid=12768,"By Reid J. EpsteinMonths after Donald Trump appeared to seal the Republican nomination for president, anti-Trump forces are making one last push to force a vote on the party's convention floor that would throw open the GOP contest again.It's a long shot, but by some counts they are remarkably close to getting past the first hurdle next week in Cleveland.Mr. Trump's intraparty foes, led by a group of rogue delegates, are waging an intense behind-the-scenes effort to push the Republican National Convention's Rules Committee for a vote on freeing delegates to back whomever they wish, rather than being bound to Mr. Trump.The presumptive nominee's team is fighting back just as vehemently, with an organized campaign of dozens of aides and volunteers. It's a power struggle that has prompted threats of reprisals and left many Republicans anxious that it could hurt the party's prospects in November.The anti-Trump camp needs the backing of 28, or one-quarter, of 112 Convention Rules Committee members to place the issue before the full convention. A Wall Street Journal survey suggests it could be close.In interviews, 20 members said they are willing to consider allowing delegates to be unbound, while 59 support Mr. Trump. The other 33 panelists couldn't be reached or didn't respond to repeated messages.Others counting votes have their own tallies. Internal surveys of the Rules Committee conducted by RNC member Randy Evans of Georgia, who is trying to help Mr. Trump fend off the insurrection, found at least 18 committee members open to voting to unbind. The Trump campaign's count shows about 15 leaning toward unbinding, according to people familiar with the campaign.Kendal Unruh, a Colorado teacher on the committee leading part of the anti-Trump movement, said she has private commitments from more than 30 committee members, but that many aren't willing to admit so publicly.All involved in counting votes say those numbers fluctuate day-to-day. If the provision gets the necessary committee votes when the panel meets beginning next Wednesday, it would place the issue before the convention, where it would need 1,237 votes -- half the delegates -- to pass.Though a majority of the convention delegates are bound to support Mr. Trump, Mr. Evans's count shows just about 890 delegates are personally loyal to the New Yorker. Another 680 oppose Mr. Trump. That leaves 900 delegates who are presumed to be ""in play,"" he said. The stop-Trump forces would have to take nearly two-thirds of them to block his nomination.A Trump campaign official described Mr. Evans's figures as ""wildly inaccurate"" and said Mr. Trump would win any floor vote at the convention.Pushing the measure to the floor would create chaos, with the party delegates fighting over a nomination long viewed as settled in full display of the international news media. With such enormous stakes, members of the committee, including Graham Hunt, an insurance salesman from Orting, Wash., are the focus of a heated behind-the-scenes lobbying effort from both camps.""It's intensifying,"" Mr. Hunt said one recent day at 9:30 a.m. ""I have 83 emails already today."" On average, he gets more than 200 emails a day from unbinding proponents along with several daily phone calls from Mr. Trump's campaign staff.Mr. Trump, who for nearly a year ignored the nuts and bolts of securing delegate slots, realized such a fight was brewing in March when The Wall Street Journal reported he garnered fewer delegates in Louisiana than primary rival Ted Cruz, even though Mr. Trump won more of the state's votes. He hired longtime Republican operative Paul Manafort, who led President Gerald Ford's whip operation in 1976.Mr. Trump is confident he will prevail.""It's ridiculous. We won more votes than any other Republican, we won 38 states and now they want to try to"" take it away, he said in an interview last week. ""No one is even writing about it anymore.""Yet every day last week, Mr. Hunt received a phone call, and on some days several, from a Trump campaign aide or surrogate seeking to win him over to their camp.What would it take for the former state lawmaker to back the New York businessman, Mr. Trump's allies ask, or at least to come out in opposition to the effort to unbind delegates?""Verbatim, they said, 'Let me ask you, what would make Donald Trump a better candidate in your opinion? We want to know because we're going to send this up to the campaign,' "" said Mr. Hunt, who led Mr. Cruz's campaign in Washington state.He remains offended at Mr. Trump's July 2015 assertion that Sen. John McCain is ""not a war hero"" because he was captured during the Vietnam War, Mr. Hunt tells them. He also offered suggestions about specific policy proposals to help war veterans. A Trump aide told Mr. Hunt they would seek to add his suggestions to the party's official platform.""Actions will be sufficient and we're not there yet,"" Mr. Hunt said.Some delegates report receiving veiled threats. One said a Trump surrogate called to say she was being monitored closely, a message she viewed as an attempt at intimidation.Mike Stuart, Mr. Trump's state co-chairman from West Virginia who is a member of the Rules Committee, said he would ask the panel to issue a formal reprimand of anti-Trump Republicans such as Mrs. Unruh and Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who has been a strident voice against Mr. Trump.""I would support consideration of sanctions against established Republicans who work to undermine our nominee,"" Mr. Stuart said.An aide to the 2012 GOP nominee declined to comment for this article. He hasn't said if he believes delegates should be unbound.Mrs. Unruh and many of her allies see Mr. Trump as a historically bad nominee who would doom fellow Republians. In addition, they are arguing that Mr. Trump's team shouldn't fear one final test of his popularity from the party's delegates.""If we are a party of liberty, what are we afraid of?"" wrote Gina Blanchard-Reed, of Washington state, in an email to her fellow Rules Committee members. ""What are we unwilling to do? Does it mean that Donald Trump would be denied the nomination? Possibly. Possibly not. He would come out of the Convention stronger if he won the nomination as a result of a FREE WILL vote.""The Trump campaign is preparing for some nightmare scenarios if the opposition gets close to the 28 votes it needs. One fear is that Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who has been critical of Mr. Trump and is the highest-profile Rules Committee member, urges votes in favor of unbinding delegates. Mr. Lee, whose wife is also on the committee, hasn't revealed his opinion on the binding question to Mrs. Unruh, the Trump campaign or RNC members and declined to do so in an interview.Some establishment Republicans are pushing against the unbind movement. Wisconsin's Steve King and Mary Buestrin, both of the RNC and Rules Committee, wrote Friday to panel committee members that those behind the unbinding effort ""are asking you to disenfranchise the votes of our family members, friends and neighbors."" Mr. King is the longtime chairman of House Speaker Paul Ryan's campaigns.Art Wittich, a Montana state legislator on the committee, is undecided on unbinding but is troubled that the effort hasn't presented an alternative candidate who could plausibly be nominated from the convention floor, he said.""My question is, if you get what you want, then what?"" Mr. Wittich said. ""Nobody can really answer that.""--Beth Reinhard and Julian Routh contributed to this article.Write to Reid J.

Trump Fundraising Picked Up in June,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802105645?accountid=12768,"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump raised nearly $20 million directly for his presidential campaign and another $32 million for two joint funds with the Republican Party in June, marking a sharp acceleration that draws him closer to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's fundraising pace.The June figures, which bring the fundraising total for Mr. Trump's campaign to $37 million this election cycle, show Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee massively expanded their fundraising operation last month. In May, Mr. Trump raised just $3.1 million for his campaign, raising concerns among donors and supporters about whether his campaign would be a viable competitor to Mrs. Clinton.In its statement Wednesday, the campaign said its recent push to raise money over email and online had yielded $19.9 million for the campaign, plus $6.6 million for one of its joint funds with the RNC, called Trump Make America Great Again.About 80% of each individual's donation to Trump Make America Great Again will be transferred to the Trump campaign, the campaign said.Separately, Mr. Trump raised $25 million for another joint fund with the RNC and state parties--called Trump Victory--by holding 22 fundraisers in the last week of May and in June, the campaign said. That committee can solicit up to $449,400 per individual donor.Just a fraction of the funds raised for Trump Victory will be transferred directly to Mr. Trump's campaign, which can accept up to $5,400 per individual. The New York businessman also donated $3.8 million to his campaign in June.The tally marks a promising start for Mr. Trump's efforts to go a more traditional fundraising route as he enters the general-election season.Mr. Trump still trails behind Mrs. Clinton, whose fundraising began more than 15 months ago. Mrs. Clinton raised $40.5 million for her campaign in June, bringing her total for the election cycle to $288 million. She also raised $28 million for her joint funds with the Democratic National Committee and state parties in the month.Mr. Trump's total June fundraising haul for all accounts--about $51 million--is shy of the $70 million Mrs. Clinton raised for her campaign and the Democratic Party.Mrs. Clinton's campaign had $44 million on hand at the end of June. Mr. Trump didn't release a cash-on-hand figure.The Trump campaign said Wednesday it was happy with the June figures. ""We're extremely pleased, especially with the online support,"" national finance chairman Steven Mnuchin said in an interview. ""We really just started this five weeks ago.""The campaign has also said it may need to raise less money than Mrs. Clinton, who has said she plans to raise $1 billion.Mr. Trump and the RNC have taken steps in recent weeks to expand their fundraising operation. Last week, they unveiled a list of state finance chairmen in 33 states, which included like Doug Deason, son of Texas tech billionaire Darwin Deason, and Peter Kalikow, a wealthy real-estate developer who recently hosted a fundraiser for a pro-Trump super PAC.The main pro-Clinton super PAC has raised $88 million through May, while the largest pro-Trump super PAC has raised $5 million.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comCredit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",10/5/16
Trump's Casinos Targeted,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1802058244?accountid=12768,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.--Democrat Hillary Clinton traveled to the boardwalk here Wednesday to spotlight Republican rival Donald Trump's casino bankruptcies, saying he repeatedly enriched himself at the expense of others.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee pointed to Mr. Trump's promise to do for the nation what he did for his business, saying this should be viewed as a warning, not an enticement.""He always rigged it so he got paid no matter how his companies performed,"" Mrs. Clinton said on a sweltering noontime boardwalk next to the former Trump Plaza casino, the faint outlines of his name visible behind her where it once adorned the building's exterior. She said that hundreds of people lost jobs, shareholders were wiped out, lenders lost money and contractors took heavy losses. ""But Donald Trump? He walked away with millions.""The event is part of the Clinton campaign's effort to turn one of Mr. Trump's biggest assets--a perception that he is a successful businessman--against him. She also pointed to a fraud suit pending against his Trump University and his record of putting the Trump name on products made abroad.In a statement Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he created ""thousands of jobs and made a lot of money"" in his casinos. He called bankruptcy ""an effective and commonly used practice"" by businesses that ""ultimately saves jobs.""""Nobody understands the economy like I do and no one, especially not Crooked Hillary Clinton, will do more for the economy than I will,"" he said.Mr. Trump's legacy in Atlantic City includes four rounds of bankruptcy for the casinos he ran there, . In addition, those casinos received limited capital investment, exacerbating their business problems, according to regulatory and financial records examined by The Wall Street Journal.Mrs. Clinton charged that Mr. Trump intentionally ran up large debts and then defaulted, without any concern for those who lost money. To drive home the point, she was introduced by a retired local business executive who said his plate glass company wasn't paid for work it performed for Trump casinos.Mr. Trump said in an interview last year that those who lost out might never have had jobs or contracts in the first place if it not for him. ""They made plenty of money on me,"" he said. He also described stock and bond investors who lost money in restructurings as ""Wall Street killers"" accustomed to his tough practices.On his Twitter account on Wednesday, Mr. Trump also sought to tie his troubles in Atlantic City to the broader local economy, pointing out that other companies with casinos there have gone or are going through bankruptcy. He blamed Atlantic City's recent trouble on decisions by local politicians there.Atlantic City was a growing casino market until about a decade ago, when neighboring states started adding gambling, and revenue plummeted. Many casino companies there have gone through bankruptcy since.Mr. Trump's troubles, however, date back further. His first bankruptcy there was in 1991, and his casinos went through another round in 2004 with him at the helm. The casinos he once ran also went into bankruptcy protection in 2009 and 2014. By the time two of the casinos he once ran filed for bankruptcy in 2014, he had lost all ownership interest in them and a third that had been sold.Casinos in the onetime East Coast gambling mecca are facing financial problems as the industry has expanded in nearby states, in part because of that limited investment in the Trump casinos and in other properties by the owners there. The city itself has been and was a recent recipient of a state bailout package.The Trump Taj Mahal, which is the last casino in Atlantic City to bear Mr. Trump's name and is currently owned by activist investor Carl Icahn, emerged from bankruptcy proceedings this year. The casino wiped out all of the workers' health-care coverage and pensions during that process, arguing that it couldn't keep the casino open otherwise. while Mr. Icahn's casino company has threatened to close the Taj if it continues. Mr. Trump has no involvement in the casino.After her remarks Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton stopped by the picket line and spent a few minutes greeting strikers who were banging drums and sounding horns in the sweltering heat.Mr. Trump opened three new casinos in Atlantic City starting in the early 1980s and ran two separate public companies that operated casinos in the city. He often touts his record as a signal of his business prowess, boasting of the profits he made there despite repeated business failings.A showed that Mr. Trump made a net profit of $160 million in Atlantic City between 1990 and 1996 through fees and other payouts that he took from the casinos there, even as they all went through bankruptcy-court proceedings during that time. Those profits in Atlantic City allowed Mr. Trump to survive a broader seismic financial crisis he was facing in other areas of his real estate empire in the early 1990s.""For many years I took money out of Atlantic City,"" Mr. Trump said in the interview last year. ""The money I made in Atlantic City fueled a lot of projects.""Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Alexandra Berzon atCredit: By Laura Meckler and Alexandra Berzon",10/5/16

"Trump Wins GOP Nomination --- Unorthodox Candidate Defied Customs, Stalwarts to Triumph",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805457259?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- The Republican Party officially made Donald Trump its standard-bearer Tuesday, making him the most unconventional presidential nominee in modern times.Mr. Trump's nomination came as his campaign sought to rebound from a tumultuous first day of floor fights and convention speeches.Mr. Trump tallied 1,725 delegates, easily surpassing the 1,237 delegate threshold needed to clinch the nomination. The delegate tally from his home state of New York, announced by Mr. Trump's son Donald Jr., put him over the top.But in an unusual roll call, votes for his former GOP primary rivals were also recorded. When Colorado shouted out its votes of 4 for Trump, 31 for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and two abstentions, a low murmur of boos could be heard in the Quicken Loans Arena.A former Democrat who has switched parties five times since 1987, Mr. Trump bested 16 candidates during a bruising Republican primary and is set to formally accept the nomination Thursday evening. Delegates also nominated Mr. Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a staunch social conservative and former congressman who adds a more traditional patina to the ticket.On Tuesday, the pressure was on his eldest son and youngest daughter to reset the pacing, tone, and messages of the convention.In his remarks, Donald Trump Jr. called himself ""the son of a great man."" He praised his father for his work ethic and for promoting blue-collar workers who showed aptitude. ""His true gift as a leader is that he sees the potential in people that they don't even see in themselves,"" he said.Tiffany Trump also offered a personal testimonial about how her dad had pushed her to excel, and would do the same for the country. ""By encouragement and by example, he motivates me to work my hardest and to always stay true to what I am and what I believe,"" she said.Mr. Trump's name was formally placed before the delegates by a trio of elected officials who endorsed him earlier this year, when he was widely shunned by the political establishment. ""One man, Donald Trump, was not intimidated,"" said Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. ""He would not be silenced. . . . Donald Trump is the singular leader that can get this country back on track.""Two of Tuesday night's speakers -- House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) -- have aims that extend beyond the top of the ticket: ensuring they preserve their majorities in Congress and the party's policy priorities. That message -- and focus on the Democratic presumptive nominee -- is central to congressional Republicans' strategy of untethering themselves from their own party's nominee.Both lawmakers emphasized that electing Mr. Trump would allow them to push through Congress a Republican policy agenda. Mr. McConnell said that with Mr. Trump in the White House, the Senate would ""pass more bills into law than any Senate in years.""Mr. Ryan mentioned Mr. Trump's name only twice during his speech. At next year's State of the Union address, he said, ""you'll find me right there on the rostrum with Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump.""Mr. Ryan nodded to the turmoil the party has experienced. ""Have we had our arguments this year? Sure we have,"" he said. He said those differences amounted to ""signs of life"" and said they meant the party was ""not just mouthing new words for the same old stuff.""While protests on the convention floor by anti-Trump delegates continued Monday and Tuesday, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was again the focus for several speakers.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was passed over by Mr. Trump for his running mate but remains a top campaign surrogate, delivered an aggressive, prosecutorial attack on Mrs. Clinton, whose ""facts of her life and career"" he said disqualify her from the presidency. As he spoke, the audience broke into chants of ""Lock her up!""Mr. Trump's differences with the party have led to strained relations with many of the top Republican donors. Billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Singer and billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch are among the party's top givers who have refused to rally behind Mr. Trump since he effectively clinched the nomination in May. Trump fundraisers say their work is also made more difficult by Mr. Trump's inclination for controversy.Yet, Mr. Trump's pugnacious and independent streak is what galvanizes his supporters.Railing against special interests and big donors, Mr. Trump largely bankrolled his own primary campaign with nearly $50 million. He surrounded himself with a small circle of advisers that included some political novices, and he traded the more intimate retail politics typical in the earliest voting states for massive rallies that often saw an outbreak of violence.On policy, Mr. Trump defied the party line on many issues, bashing free trade deals, calling for reduced American intervention in foreign conflicts, and declining to back a major overhaul of entitlement programs, a key priority for Mr. Ryan.He also took a hard line against illegal immigration, resisting calls from elected officials and party leaders to send a more inclusive message to try to broaden the party's reach beyond its white, male base. In the end, he built a new coalition to win the nomination and revamped the GOP's core message to become more isolationist and less business friendly.New York Rep. Chris Collins, who seconded Mr. Trump's nomination, said the businessman would champion American jobs and take a tougher foreign-policy stance. ""It's time to take back our country,"" he said. ""President Trump is going to build a wall and secure our borders. President Trump is going to defeat terrorism and make our country safe again. President Trump is going to bring back our stolen jobs.""---Janet Hook contributed to this article.(See related article: ""After a Rocky Start, Party Seeks to Move On"" -- WSJ July 20, 2016)Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Rebecca Ballhaus",10/6/16
The Republican Convention: Platform Changes In the Trump Era,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805456590?accountid=12768,"The Republican Party platform has changed significantly over time on some issues. Some changes this year reflect Donald Trump's priorities:Trade2016: International trade is crucial for all sectors of America's economy. Massive trade deficits are not. . . . We need better negotiated trade agreements that put America first. When trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports. When those agreements do not adequately protect U.S. interests, U.S. sovereignty, or when they are violated with impunity, they must be rejected.2012: International trade is crucial for our economy. . . . A Republican president will complete negotiations for a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open rapidly developing Asian markets to U.S. products.Analysis: Mr. Trump's skepticism of trade deals and call for a tougher negotiating stance is prominent in the new platform.Immigration2016: Our highest priority . . . must be to secure our borders and all ports of entry and to enforce our immigration laws. That is why we support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry.1980: Republicans are proud that our people have opened their arms and hearts to strangers from abroad, and we favor an immigration and refugee policy which is consistent with this tradition. We believe that to the fullest extent possible those immigrants should be admitted who will make a positive contribution to America and who are willing to accept the fundamental American values.Analysis: A debate within the party over immigration policy has tilted in favor of tougher enforcement and tighter border control.

"Trump Wins GOP Nomination --- After a Rocky Start, Party Seeks to Move On",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805440168?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- Republicans gathered Tuesday hoping to dispel a strange cloud that emerged from nowhere and hung over their party's convention all day.The problem: Donald Trump's wife, Melania, who delivered what had originally been a well-received speech to the Republican National Convention, was accused within hours of plagiarizing first lady Michelle Obama.By Tuesday night, the party was moving past the speech -- while still worrying that it might be symptomatic of some lingering problems facing their presidential candidate and his campaign.The Trump team angrily beat back the plagiarizing charges, but they were rehashed endlessly in hallways here, as well as on cable television conversations. They overshadowed the proceedings for much of the convention's second day, and became a kind of metaphor for a convention that isn't following traditional form and a campaign that is entering general-election season still racing to build the kind of fully formed organization that could prevent such problems.Parts of two paragraphs of Mrs. Trump's speech Monday evening were nearly identical to Mrs. Obama's 2008 speech at the Democratic convention, including when she praised her husband and the values they were raised with and want to pass on to their children.Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort dismissed the accusations and, without providing any evidence, blamed Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for instigating the controversy as a way to take down a rival woman.""There's a political tint to this whole issue,"" he said.Clinton spokesman Jennifer Palmieri pushed back on Mr. Manafort's claim. ""Nice try, not true,"" she said in a Twitter post. ""Blaming Hillary Clinton isn't the answer for (every) Trump campaign problem.""The campaign wouldn't disclose how the speech was drafted or who was behind its writing. Stephen Miller, the campaign's policy director and an adviser on Mr. Trump's speech, told The Wall Street Journal that no one would lose their job over Mrs. Trump's remarks. ""There is nothing to take the fall for,"" he said.Tuesday's rocky start followed one of the most combustible first days of a convention in recent memory. On Monday, the Trump campaign had to quell a vocal uprising on the convention floor when a group of angry delegates waged a procedural fight over the rules that govern the gathering.That afternoon, Iowa Rep. Steve King, known for his hard-line immigration policies, caused an uproar online when he defended ""old white people"" by asking, ""Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?""Mr. Trump interrupted coverage of his own convention on Fox News Monday night to conduct a telephone interview during remarks by the mother of one of the four Americans killed in Benghazi, Libya in 2012. During the interview, he suggested the Black Lives Matter movement bears some responsibility for the recent killings of police in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La.He also used the occasion to criticize Ohio Gov. John Kasich, his former GOP primary rival, for skipping the convention. Mr. Kasich had laughed off such barbs from Mr. Trump's campaign earlier in the day.The plagiarism problem comes amid Republican concerns that the Trump campaign, an unusual enterprise that prevailed in the primary on the strength of its candidate's personal image-building and without most of the traditional campaign structure, isn't yet ready for the mine fields of a tough general-election campaign.Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus, speaking at a Bloomberg News breakfast, said the campaign ""came out of the primaries pretty thin, paying for their own campaign,"" before joining the national committee for more organizational and fund-raising prowess. He added: ""I think you're going to see that by the time you get to August, you're going to have a campaign that is out there across the country.""Mr. Priebus also said that he ""probably"" would fire a speech writer if he were put in the same position.Several Republicans outside the campaign quickly pointed fingers, arguing Mr. Trump should fire those responsible for writing or vetting his wife's speech.""I would expect whoever did it to resign,"" said Karl Rove, the top political adviser to former President George W. Bush and a Wall Street Journal opinion pages columnist.Ryan Call, former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party, said it was ""almost criminal negligence"" on the part of the campaign to leave Mrs. Trump open to accusations of plagiarism.""I came to this convention hoping to be persuaded and to be able to support the Republican nominee,"" he said. ""There's still the opportunity to change the narrative over the next couple days, and I hope we're going to see something that can inspire confidence.""(See related article: ""Celebrity Businessman Defied Customs, Stalwarts to Triumph"" -- WSJ July 20, 2016)Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus and Patrick O'Connor",10/6/16
"GOP Chief Ramped Up Machine For Trump --- After a rocky start, Priebus became presumptive nominee's trusted ally",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805458517?accountid=12768,"After listening to the first few minutes of the San Diego Symphony's ""Star Spangled Pops"" concert with his family July 3, Republican National Committee head Reince Priebus bolted to the airport for a red-eye flight to New York.Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, were hosting Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst in separate tryouts for the vice-presidential pick, and Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Priebus's input in a hurry.The next morning at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., they began weighing the pros and cons over cold Arnold Palmers.From that point on, Mr. Trump often called Mr. Priebus with his thoughts and questions about the vice-presidential decision-making process -- and nearly every strategy and maneuver going into this week's convention in Cleveland.This intense and little-known collaboration between Mr. Priebus, the leader of the Republican Party, and Mr. Trump, the party's presumptive nominee, is one of the most significant plot twists of the campaign. For several months, Messrs. Priebus and Trump kept their distance from one another. Mr. Trump once said the RNC chairman's handling of the primary process was""a disgrace,"" and some party activists doubted Mr. Priebus could keep his job if Mr. Trump won the nomination.Nevertheless, Mr. Priebus, 44 years old, has become one of Mr. Trump's top advisers, often speaking with him several times a day on topics large and small, including strategies to beat Democrat Hillary Clinton. He makes cocktail-party remarks on Mr. Trump's behalf at GOP fundraisers and has pushed reluctant Republicans relentlessly to get behind Mr. Trump.If Mr. Trump wins in November, one big reason could be Mr. Priebus's decision to throw the GOP's campaign machine fully behind him. The GOP chairman has essentially hard-wired the Trump campaign into the RNC's well-funded and more-experienced apparatus.""We've got a candidate who doesn't have a huge infrastructure, but we do,"" says Mr. Priebus.In Cleveland, the waves Mr. Trump has made within the party haven't subsided. At least a dozen Republican senators, four governors, the past two Republican presidents and the past two nominees skipped the convention either in opposition to Mr. Trump's elevation or to avoid association with it. Among those absent were two of Ohio's biggest GOP names: Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rob Portman, who is facing a tough re-election.On the convention floor Monday, Mr. Trump's aides joined with RNC officials to stop an effort to allow the delegates to vote for someone other than the presumptive nominee. The tactics prompted Colorado's delegation, which included many leaders of the anti-Trump rebellion, to walk out. Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a leader of anti-Trump efforts, told MSNBC: ""This is done, they rolled through, they cheated, they cheated.""Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, derided Mr. Priebus in a tweet last week as an ""obedient, compliant apparatchik willing to subordinate a grand old party to a new strongman.""Mr. Priebus responds: ""Of course, I'm doing everything possible to help our presumptive nominee. That's my job.""It is uncommon for either national party to run so many key functions for its nominee -- such as field staff for on-the-ground campaign operations, opposition researchand data work for voter outreach. Four years ago, the leaders of Mitt Romney's campaign ""had our own campaign operation, with the RNC on the side and definitely not at the core, as it is now,"" says House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was Mr. Romney's running mate.During the primary season, Mr. Priebus tried to maintain a neutral position among ""16 candidates with triple-A personalities,"" he says. ""These weren't church mice."" As Mr. Trump emerged as the strongest and loudest candidate, he wasn't shy about criticizing the GOP chairman. He said Mr. Priebus ""should be ashamed of himself"" for his role in the party's ""rigged"" delegate systemduring the primaries. Mr. Priebus publicly criticized Mr. Trump for some of his most controversial positions, such as banning Muslims from entering the U.S.The ill will between the two men dissipated when Mr. Trump won the Indiana primary, forcing his last serious rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, to drop out of the race. Within minutes, Mr. Priebus tweeted that ""we all need to unite and focus on defeating"" Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Trump says now that ""Reince got it -- meaning Trump -- before others"" in the Republican Party.Mr. Priebus faced a crisis when Mr. Ryan, a close friend and fellow Wisconsinite, said he was ""not ready"" to back Mr. Trump. ""I'm not there right now,"" the U.S.'s highest-ranking elected Republican official told CNN on May 6. Mr. Trump fired back. ""I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people.""Mr. Priebus then moved in, setting up a meeting between Messrs. Trump and Ryan. ""Reince got us together,"" Mr. Ryan says. ""He's been the consummate honest broker.""The meeting in Mr. Priebus's office inRNC headquarters began a process that led to Mr. Ryan's qualified endorsement of Mr. Trump in early June.When the Trump campaign was roiled with infighting between then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and convention chairman Paul Manafort, a longtime Washington hand brought in to ramp up for the general election, Mr. Priebus did not pick between the feuding officials. Instead he started a dialogue with the candidate's adult children, who actively advise their father while running his real-estate empire. ""We quickly grew to respect and trust Reince,"" says Donald Trump Jr.Mr. Priebus was often added to the confidential email list of Mr. Trump's innermost circle used for big decisions and issues.After Mr. Trump called out fellow Republicans who weren't solidly behind him or outright dissing him, Mr. Priebus used his access to influence Mr. Trump. ""I don't think you should hit other Republicans,"" he said. Mr. Trump indicated that he planned to keep griping about them if necessary but wouldn't say their names publicly.Mr. Priebus also has taken on a large role in raising money on behalf of Mr. Trump, who was unaccustomed to asking for money and making small talk to get contributions. At some of their first fundraising events together, Mr. Priebus arrived early enough to handle all the schmoozing for the first hour or so until Mr. Trump arrived.As the convention in Cleveland neared, Mr. Priebus cajoled and even pleaded with important Republicans to attend. On July 6, he took Mr. Cruz out for a steak dinner in an attempt to broker peace between the rivals.Mr. Priebus asked if they would meet privately, with him as a buffer. After Mr. Cruz agreed, Mr. Priebus delivered a reminder to Mr. Trump. ""Offer grace to people in buckets in politics, because you are playing a long game,"" he said. ""It will be worth it if you become president.""After meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz agreed to speak at the convention. Mr. Priebus told him: ""It would be helpful if you could have positive words about Donald.""Last Tuesday night, Mr. Trump had narrowed the field to Mr. Pence, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""You've got good options, so now it's a personal decision for you to determine what's best for the country and for you,"" Mr. Priebus said from Cleveland.Mr. Trump asked: ""What would you do?""Mr. Priebus wouldn't comment on what he told Mr. Trump.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Monica Langley",10/6/16

Let's all come together in a national campaign like no other,"" said Mrs. Trump during her 15-minute address to the Republican National Convention Monday night.""He does not give up,"" said Mrs. Trump, who appeared in a fitted, white dress. ""If you want someone to fight for you and your country, I can assure you that he's the guy.""The speech was the most uplifting and positive one in a night dominated by darker addresses focused on terrorism and global insecurity.Mrs. Trump, a former model and the New York businessman's third wife, was the first in what will be a parade of family members to speak on Mr. Trump's behalf at the convention. It was a national political debut of sorts for Mrs. Trump, who had been heard from rarely during the campaign.Mr. Trump's four adult children were all given speaking spots, including Tiffany Trump, a recent college graduate. Ivanka Trump is scheduled to take the prominent role of introducing her father on the convention's final night, Thursday, while sons Donald Jr. and Eric are set to speak on Tuesday and on Wednesday.An immigrant, Mrs. Trump's native language is Slovenian, though she also speaks French, Serbian, German and English. The 46-year-old mother to Mr. Trump's youngest child has dabbled in business but focused much of her time on charity work.

"The Republican Convention: Clinton Attacked, Foes Silenced --- Trump critics denied a roll call on their move to let delegates back other candidates",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805203722?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- On the first night of Donald Trump's convention, Republicans assailed Hillary Clinton for the 2012 attack on Benghazi, illegal immigration and recent killings of police officers they said were the result of societal breakdowns caused by feckless leadership in Washington.At the same time, Mr. Trump's campaign and its Republican National Committee allies presided over the most chaotic scene at a national party convention in generations, with hundreds of delegates shouting for a roll-call vote to disrupt his forthcoming nomination and one state delegation walking off the floor.Mr. Trump's campaign dismissed the midafternoon disruption as the last gasp of a shrinking number of intraparty opponents. But Kendal Unruh, a leading anti-Trump delegate, said the schisms are now worse. ""They chose to divide and try to conquer. He didn't unify the party,"" Mrs. Unruh said.Near the close of the evening, Mr. Trump emerged from a darkened stage to introduce his wife, Melania, as the Queen anthem ""We are the Champions"" pumped through the arena's speakers.Upon taking the stage, Mrs. Trump said her husband was honored to be the GOP's choice for president and testified to his patriotic commitment.""I can tell you with certainty that my husband has been concerned about our country for as long as I have known him,"" Mrs. Trump said. ""He will never, ever let you down.""Earlier in the evening session, delegates heard from mothers of U.S. officials killed in Benghazi and a father whose son was murdered by an undocumented immigrant. David Clarke, the African-American sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis., opened his remarks with a retort that ""blue lives matter,"" a reference to recent shootings of police officers.The themes were aimed at undermining Mrs. Clinton's foreign policy experience and service as secretary of state. They also played to a Trump strength, as a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed voters think he would be tougher on the issue of terrorism by a slight margin.Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in the attack at the embassy compound in Libya, accused Mrs. Clinton of being emotionally callous. ""I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son, personally,"" she said. ""I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead.""Her address left some delegates in tears. Yet, in another sign of the undisciplined nature of Mr. Trump's candidacy, he called in to the Fox News Channel at the same moment to criticize Ohio Gov. John Kasich, his former GOP primary rival, for skipping the convention.The lack of unity for Mr. Trump's nomination was on full display when the delegates convened to vote on the reports of the rules and platform committees. Delegates who have sought for months to deny him the nomination found themselves silenced on key procedural votes.The final blow to the stop-Trump movement came when Republican National Committee staffers, allied with Trump campaign whips, beat back an effort to conduct a roll-call vote on the party's rules.Delegates seeking to unseat Mr. Trump had hoped the convention would reject the rules adopted last week and allow delegates to vote their conscience.Hundreds of delegates, including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, shouted their disapproval, chanting ""roll call vote."" Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, who was presiding over the convention, instead announced based on a voice vote that the ""ayes"" had it and the party's rules were approved.Mr. Womack left the stage, announcing that the rules had been adopted. The Colorado delegation, which included many of the leaders of the anti-Trump rebellion, walked out of the arena as Mr. Trump's backers shouted ""U-S-A"" and support for Mr. Trump.Credit: By Reid J.

Main Street: The Case for Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805202840?accountid=12768,"Cleveland -- What's the best case for Donald Trump?The question comes in the week Republicans here will formally nominate him for president, and the answer is not complicated. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence gave it as his reason for signing on as Mr. Trump's VP: The alternative is President Hillary Clinton.This is the reality of choice in a two-party democracy. Still, many have a hard time accepting it. So even as Mr. Trump handily dispatched 16 more-experienced rivals, his shortcomings and unfitness for office have become a staple of conservative fare.Yes, Mr. Trump elevates insult over argument. Yes, he is vague and contradictory about the details of his own proposals. And yes, he often speaks aloud before thinking things through. It's all fair game.Even so, in this election Mr. Trump is not running against himself. Though you might not know it from much of the commentary and coverage, he is running against Mrs. Clinton.On so many issues -- free trade, the claim that Mexico will pay for a border wall, his suspiciously recent embrace of the pro-life cause -- Mr. Trump gives reasons for pause. But he still isn't Mrs. Clinton. That's crucial, because much of the argument for keeping Mr. Trump out of the Oval Office at all costs requires glossing over the damage a second Clinton presidency would do.Start with the economy. There is zero reason to believe a Clinton administration would be any improvement over the past eight years, from taxes and spending and regulation to ObamaCare. If elected, moreover, Mrs. Clinton would be working with a Democratic Party that has been pulled sharply left by Bernie Sanders.Mrs. Clinton's flip-flop on the Trans-Pacific Partnership is illuminating. As President Obama's secretary of state, she waxed enthusiastic. But when it came time to take her stand as a presidential candidate, she folded. Mr. Trump has made his own protectionist noises, but if this same trade agreement had been negotiated by a Trump White House, who doubts that he would be telling us what a great deal it was for American workers?Or what about social issues? Mrs. Clinton has loudly repudiated the moderating language her husband ran on in 1992, notably on abortion. In sharp contrast, she is the candidate who touts the Planned Parenthood view of human life, who sees nothing wrong with forcing nuns to provide employees with contraceptives, and who supports the Obama administration's bid to compel K-through-12 public schools to open girls' bathrooms to males who identify as female.In short, Mrs. Clinton is the culture war on steroids.Which leaves foreign affairs. Here again, the initiatives where she was front-and-center do not inspire confidence: the Russian reset and Benghazi. More to the point, while she now apologizes for her 2002 vote to authorize the use of military force in Iraq, what she ought to be apologizing for is her admission that her 2007 opposition to the surge in Iraq was dictated not by any military concerns but because she was worried about facing antiwar candidate Barack Obama in the Iowa Democratic primary.Today this same woman supports the nuclear deal with Tehran and offers an Islamic State strategy that sounds tough but is not materially different from Mr. Obama's. This is the ""hawk"" we're always hearing about?Nor is the case against Mrs. Clinton limited to policy. It's as much about personnel, which goes much further than the activist nominees she would almost certainly nominate for the Supreme Court.When presidents enter office, they bring with them about 6,000 people. From the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and White House assistants down to the lowliest Justice Department lawyer, Mrs. Clinton would fill her government with people who get up each day looking to tax, spend, regulate -- and use the federal government to stomp on anyone in their way.At a time when so much of American ""law"" -- from the Health and Human Service's contraceptive mandate, to the Education Department's ""Dear Colleague"" letters on transgender policy, to the National Labor Relations Board's prosecution of Boeing for opening a new plant in South Carolina instead of in Washington state -- is decided by faceless federal bureaucrats, Mrs. Clinton would stuff these federal agencies from top to bottom with Lois Lerners and Elizabeth Warrens.Welcome to 21st-century American liberalism, which no longer even pretends to produce results. Whatever the shortcomings of Mr. Trump's people, non-progressives simply do not share the itch to use the government to boss everyone else around. On top of this, an overreaching President Trump would not be excused by the press and would face both Republican and Democratic opposition.Fair enough to argue that Mr. Trump represents a huge risk. But honesty requires that this risk be weighed against a clear-eyed look at the certainties a Hillary Clinton administration would bring.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: The Better Angels of Our Nature Face Reality"" -- WSJ July 25, 2016)Credit: By William McGurn",10/6/16
Trump's Best Path to Victory,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805202711?accountid=12768,"Two-hundred and seventy. That's the number of Electoral College votes one needs to become the most powerful person on earth. And according to most of the so-called experts, it won't be Donald Trump. While I agree that he is the underdog, a Trump victory is not impossible. Here's how it could happen.If this were a typical presidential election, the logical first step would be to pick the most likely combination of states to put the Trump campaign over the 270 threshold. Then you would spend all of your time, energy and resources targeting the battleground states. It has worked this way for decades. Pundits, academics and TV analysts are busy re-creating this process using predictive modeling and campaign-honed wisdom.The reality, though, is that this election is unlike any other in recent history -- and Mr. Trump is not your quintessential Republican nominee. If he followed the traditions, norms and standard practices of the past, he undoubtedly would lose.But there is a path to 270. For Mr. Trump to win, he needs to incite a national movement and a significant shift in voting behavior. Think of the 1970s movie ""Network,"" with people shouting out their windows: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore."" This time, instead of shouting they are voting for Mr. Trump. He can worry less about specific states to target and spend more time on a national branding and message campaign centered on motivating specific audiences, not states. Mr. Trump did precisely that to win the Republican primaries.There has been much criticism of Mr. Trump as a messenger. But what he seems to understand remarkably well is that he has become the megaphone for a large group of voters who feel they have been disenfranchised from the political process, and abandoned on the economic battlefield by both parties. Mr. Trump also knows that ""acting presidential"" is equivalent to no longer being authentic and believable to his supporters. You're never going to create an anti-Washington wave of the magnitude he needs if you sound too much like a focus-group-tested, teleprompter-guided candidate.The other advantage of this type of national campaign is that it costs less than a highly targeted state-by-state campaign. Mr. Trump doesn't have the pieces in place or the money to run a massive turnout operation, and it is too late to change that significantly. Instead, he needs to use an emotional appeal and create a national dialogue with voters by leveraging the seemingly unlimited supply of time and space the news media is so happy to give him.Note too that Hillary Clinton's early money advantage isn't as important as some political analysts claim. Television ads matter less in a presidential race because candidates get so much free airtime.To get to 270 electoral votes, Mr. Trump must first win every state Mitt Romney did. I realize that mathematically it isn't necessary, but symbolically it is. If Mr. Trump were to lose some of the Romney states, it would signal that critical Republican voting groups had deserted him, most likely moderate Republican women or evangelicals.There are a few Romney states that are attractive for the Clinton campaign to go after, North Carolina in particular. Mr. Trump also seems to be struggling in Arizona, likely because of its large Hispanic and Mormon populations. This is a huge problem, because he has little margin for error.But let's assume Mr. Trump carries all of the Romney states. The tempting approach would then be to look at the states where Mr. Romney lost by the smallest margins.But it would be wiser to look at states with the largest number of middle-income working families, and a sizable population of the children of Reagan Democrats. The largest blocs of those voters can be found in the Rust Belt. This means looking first at Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin (before turning to Virginia, Colorado and New Hampshire).The big trio will be remarkably difficult to win. Pennsylvania hasn't gone for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, and Wisconsin since 1984. But these states are chock-full of swing voters, many of whom are in sync with Mr. Trump on trade, immigration and national security. I have sat through many focus groups with these voters, and they are starving for a restoration of the American dream. They don't believe that's going to happen with a traditional candidate.The best news for Mr. Trump: With the right nominee, these three states aren't afraid to vote Republican. Each has a Republican senator, and two of the three have Republican governors. Mr. Trump pretty much has to win two of the three. I think Ohio and Pennsylvania are his best chances, as recent polls confirm.By putting Pennsylvania and Ohio in the Trump column, combined with the Romney states, Mr. Trump would sit at 244 electoral votes. At this point there would be two ways to get to 270: Win a collection of states such as Virginia, Colorado and New Hampshire, or win Florida. Neither John McCain in 2008 nor Mr. Romney won any of these states. But George W. Bush won all of them -- twice.I think the victory-in-Florida scenario is the more likely. Mr. Trump will benefit from a close relationship with the state's governor, Rick Scott, and, ironically, by having Marco Rubio back in the U.S. Senate race, increasing Republican enthusiasm and turnout.More than 30,000 new Republicans registered to vote in Florida this year and many observers believe that Mr. Trump was the driving factor. In recent days, Mrs. Clinton's numbers in Florida have eroded significantly, highlighting the state's volatility.All of this is a heavy lift for the Trump campaign. But who dreamed that Donald Trump could defeat 16 highly skilled and credible adversaries to become the Republican nominee?---Mr. Brabender, a national Republican strategist and media adviser, is a partner at BrabenderCox.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Time to Move Use of 'Rust Belt' to History's Ash Heap"" -- WSJ July 25, 2016)Credit: By John Brabender",10/6/16
Trump's Mum Supporters,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805439373?accountid=12768,"None of us will ever cast a vote that decides a presidential race, whereas we all bear immediate social cost and risk by saying whom we're voting for. That's the reality of incentives. Lots of prominent Republicans and conservative pundits have good reason for not sullying their carefully cultivated brands with Donald Trump's by saying they'll vote for him. This is understandable. In fact, it's a no-brainer.Of course, how you vote and what you say about your vote can be two different things. Kennedy won the 1960 election in a landslide according to polls taken after his assassination.So let's say it: As long as you don't have to pay a social price for it, a Trump presidency might not be so bad. A Trump victory would be inconceivable without his bringing a GOP Congress along. His business friends would steer him away from wild actions. Mr. Trump himself has said he has no intention of destabilizing the economy.We might get some real reform out of a Paul Ryan-led Congress. This would be Mr. Trump's easiest path to the victories (""we're winning again!"") he craves, and the reason some prominent conservatives like Larry Kudlow have risked their good names by lending them to Mr. Trump.The stock market has been straight up since Brexit, and since polls started showing Mr. Trump competitive with Hillary Clinton. Some credit central banks or turn up their hands, but a Trump reflation-with-tax-cuts, if the alternative is a Clinton reflation with a blowout expansion of entitlements, probably sounds OK to many investors.What about the character question? It's hard to believe voters would have elected Kennedy, LBJ, Nixon or Bill Clinton based on what they know now. Voters know a great deal about Mr. Trump. He might be the biggest sleaze they ever knowingly vote for, but not the biggest to hold the office.To imagine, as writers for the New Yorker do, that Mr. Trump threatens the very institutions of American democracy is to have little faith in the potency and self-love of Congress, the courts, the bureaucracy. Yes, instinct says beware the candidate who bases his appeal partly on teaching other countries a lesson. The chances of Mr. Trump being a disaster are not zero, but they never are.What seems more likely to resonate in the long term, frankly, is not the Trump singularity but the realignment of politics the Trump phenomenon represents amid a crisis for the Western economic model. The U.S. version may not be as bad as the European or Japanese version, but our politics seem destined to be embittered by declining expectations and pinched resources.White voters haven't traditionally seen themselves as a bloc, but as less-educated whites feel their status diminished, the biggest minority in the future may start to see itself as just that. Democrats, meanwhile, have become the true party of entitlement reform, pushing means-tested handouts for new voter groups at the expense of the aging constituents of Social Security and Medicare.ObamaCare was meant to be funded by Medicare cuts. Elders know a new Obama- and Clinton-touted proposal for a ""public option"" would put them in competition with younger, more liberal voters for government health resources. They've heard technocrats mutter for years about the ""misallocation"" of so much money to unproductive seniors in the last years of their lives.Where do African-American voters come down? This might be the pivotal question for future elections. In the 2010 census, the median age of black Americans was a full 10 years behind the median age of white Americans, but the black share of the under-18 population -- i.e., the future -- was already shrinking right along with the white share.Half of all births in Texas now are Hispanic. Hispanics are the largest single demographic in California. Mr. Trump says black Americans will flock to him in November. They won't. But in future contests they may increasingly see their interests in the same way aging white Trumpistas do, on entitlements and immigration at least.Back to the election: What has Republicans and conservatives withholding their endorsements, of course, is the possibility of a total debacle in the fall, the Trump campaign laying an egg. He blurts out something indefensible. Shady dealings surface. The alleged audit that keeps him from releasing his tax returns suddenly morphs into an IRS prosecution.Mr. Trump's campaign minions haven't helped this week by badgering the Bushes, Mitt Romney and Gov. John Kasich -- whose state hosts the convention and which Mr. Trump needs in the fall -- for not wishing to risk their reputations on Mr. Trump, an outsider-celebrity with no obvious long-term commitment to the GOP or conservative values.The problem is real. If the race is close in November, it could be decisive. The convention may be Mr. Trump's last chance to solve it, by showing he can be trusted to repay the loyalty he's asking conservatives of independent standing to invest in him.Credit: By Holman W.

Election 2016: Trump Calls on Justice Ginsburg to Resign,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803693830?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump called on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign, taking the clash between the presumptive GOP presidential nominee and a member of the Supreme Court further into uncharted territory.Mr. Trump on Tuesday and Wednesday used Twitter to respond to a series of highly unusual and escalating comments from Justice Ginsburg in which she suggested a Trump White House would be bad for the court and the nation.""Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot -- resign!,"" Mr. Trump said in a tweet sent close to midnight Tuesday.""Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!,"" he said in a Wednesday afternoon tweet.Justice Ginsburg, through a court spokeswoman, declined to comment.While judges and justices normally steer clear of public comments about politics, Justice Ginsburg in three media interviews criticized Mr. Trump and his candidacy, culminating in comments CNN published Tuesday in which she called the mogul ""a faker"" and questioned how he has ""gotten away"" with not releasing his tax returns.Direct clashes between politicians and justices are exceedingly rare and perhaps unprecedented in the heat of a modern political campaign. The closest recent analogy may come from the 2010 State of the Union, when President Barack Obama criticized the Supreme Court's Citizens United campaign finance ruling and said it could lead to foreign entities bankrolling American elections. Justice Samuel Alito, one of several justices in the audience, mouthed ""Not true.""In 1987, Justice Thurgood Marshall drew attention for comments in a television interview in which he criticized the civil-rights record of President Ronald Reagan and said the California Republican was at ""the bottom"" compared with other presidents. Mr. Reagan responded by inviting him to the White House. ""I literally told him my life story and how there was not prejudice in me,"" Mr. Reagan wrote in his diary. ""I think I made a friend.""White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed questions about Justice Ginsburg at a Wednesday briefing. ""I would not call her competence into question and I think anybody who has observed her, she's done her work,"" Mr. Earnest said.Legal observers said it is unrealistic to expect that judges won't have personal political views, and it isn't uncommon for members of the high court to consider aligning their retirement plans with the election of a president who would be likely to appoint a like-minded replacement. Those considerations, for example, were reportedly on the mind of former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in the 2000 election contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore.The code of conduct for judges says that members of the judiciary shouldn't publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office. The code doesn't apply to the Supreme Court but the justices generally are guided by it.""There is room to argue this is a unique kind of election,"" said Indiana University law professor Charles Geyh, though he added that Justice Ginsburg's comments were ""more nakedly political than what I think the code of conduct contemplates.""---Jess Bravin contributed to this aricle.Credit: By Brent Kendall",10/11/16
What Trump Needs for a Cleveland Bounce,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803674234?accountid=12768,"In the next few weeks there will be much interest in ""bounces"" -- the jump in the polls that most presidential candidates enjoy after their party's convention. Gallup has found that since 1964 Democrats have received an average 5.8% post-convention bounce and Republicans 4.9%. Actual performances vary from these averages. In 2012 President Obama jumped three points after his convention; Mitt Romney's numbers remained virtually unchanged after his.Donald Trump has been trending up in the polls this month, but to win he needs next week's Cleveland convention to succeed. Doing that -- leaving voters with the best impression of candidate, party and message -- involves more going right than might be imagined.First, Mr. Trump must unify the GOP. This means forgoing attacks on fellow Republicans, acting gracious toward party leaders who skipped the convention, and making the gathering about more than simply himself. He should emphasize the party's values and the success of down-ballot candidates.The presumptive nominee must avoid putting himself in situations like President Carter did in 1980, pathetically wandering the stage trying to get his primary challenger, Sen. Ted Kennedy, to raise arms together. By word, action and the convention's programming, Mr. Trump must enthuse the Republicans watching on television who are lukewarm about his candidacy.These tasks are critical for the candidate. To win in November, he must capture at least 90% of Republicans. The June 23 Washington Post/ABC poll had him carrying only 77% of Republicans. While Mr. Trump called the survey ""very dishonest,"" the June 28 Fox News poll found similar numbers, with Trump winning 74% of Republicans.The two polls differed in how independents split. The Post/ABC poll had Mr. Trump winning them 45% to 43% while Fox put him up 39% to 31%.Swing voters are the convention's most important audience, especially those in battleground states. They typically pay less attention to politics, so impressions created in Cleveland will greatly affect their openness to vote Republican.The convention must therefore present Mr. Trump in the best possible light -- humanize him by dwelling on his background and family. But overdoing it risks the gathering coming off a personality cult.Successful conventions also focus on critical issues and America's future: Republicans must leave viewers with clarity about the GOP's agenda. This requires far more than a good platform.Everyone who appears on the stage -- the candidate, keynote speaker, convention officials and others -- should offer a forward-looking message about what a new Republican administration would do. This vision should be inclusive (we are all in this together) and appeal to the best instincts of ordinary Americans. Showcasing rising GOP leaders, especially young and diverse figures, can help.It is critical that Mr. Trump's message be one of constructive change: After a period of disunity and rancor, he should offer common purpose; after economic malaise, growth and prosperity; and after U.S. retreat and weakness, a return of American leadership and resolve abroad.This will require message discipline in all his utterances, especially his acceptance speech. Over 30 million watched Mitt Romney's in 2012, while more than 38 million tuned in to Mr. Obama's.The moment has an inherent tension. The hall is jammed with 20,000 screaming partisans, but Mr. Trump should resist the temptation to deliver his typical rally speech. His target audience isn't those in the building but everyone watching on TV. Viewers at home don't want to be whipped into a frenzy by whatever pops into Mr. Trump's mind.Instead, these viewers want to connect with the candidate on a personal level, to understand what he values and what makes him tick. Only an effective acceptance speech will make them warm further to his candidacy.Running mates don't win elections. Bernard Grofman and Reuben Kline of the University of California, Irvine find that ""the net impact of vice presidential selection is at most 1 percentage point."" But voters will form most of their impression of Mr. Trump's choice during the convention. A good pick may improve their views of the presidential candidate, too -- so give the VP nominee sufficient airtime.Though trailing in the Real Clear Politics average by 4.3 percentage points, Mr. Trump has received good news this week. A new Washington Post/ABC poll finds that 56% of voters disagree with the decision not to indict Mrs. Clinton over her email; Quinnipiac polls show him leading in Florida and Pennsylvania and tied in Ohio; and a Monmouth survey puts him ahead in Iowa.Donald Trump remains the underdog. But mounting a successful, attractive, compelling show in Cleveland could help cement his recent gains and give him the bounce he needs to be competitive.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",10/11/16
Can Trump Win Ohio?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803673950?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, Republican, is days away from his presidential convention in Cleveland, Ohio, the one state he must win to become president.The good news for Mr. Trump is that this week's Wall Street Journal poll puts him in a 39%-39% dead heat in Ohio with Hillary Clinton. The bad news is most wish they had someone else to vote for. Ohio, as always, is in play.Since the Republican Party's founding in 1854, none of its candidates has won the presidency without carrying Ohio. None. The only Democrats ever to win without capturing the Buckeye State were Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy. Hillary Clinton is no John Kennedy.""Ohio is the Republicans' gateway to the Midwest,"" says Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball. Mr. Kondik is also an Ohio native who just published ""The Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President."" He says flatly that ""if Trump cannot win Ohio, he cannot win the election."" By which he means that without Ohio, it isn't likely Mr. Trump would carry Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota or Iowa.John Green, who heads the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron, has spent his career analyzing Ohio's politics. I asked him this week if Donald Trump can win Ohio by running what is emerging as a Rust Belt strategy of leaning heavily on anti-trade sentiment.""He can,"" said Mr. Green, if he also does two things: expand the Republican vote, as he promises to do; and not lose support among Ohio's huge numbers of suburban Republicans.There is one other detail without which, I think, Donald Trump simply can't win in Ohio: John Kasich.John Kasich is still steamed.As of this week, Gov. Kasich was not even going to appear at the Cleveland convention center. Speaking to a Cleveland TV station last week, he said he's still waiting for Mr. Trump, like Saul on the road to Damascus, to undergo a political conversion: ""If it doesn't come, then I probably will not find my way towards endorsing.""As these columns noted recently, among the perils of routinely insulting one's political opponents in public is they never forget. That could be a problem for Donald Trump because Ohio is a turnout state. To win, you must flush out every possible voter.Right now, if anything, the party's activists are campaigning for Ohio's incumbent GOP senator, Rob Portman. If Gov. Kasich doesn't throw the switch on the state's GOP election machine, Mr. Trump will have to fashion his own turnout operation in Ohio. It's getting late for that.Messrs. Kondik and Green don't discount the possibility that this unique Republican candidate could win Ohio without more than the powerful magic sauce called Trump. But both note that a victorious Ohio coalition has to cover so much political ground that Mr. Trump's hot stuff by itself might be insufficient to deliver the state.Mr. Trump's challenge in Ohio is three-fold. He has to pull votes away from Mrs. Clinton's three Democratic strongholds -- Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. He has to run up the vote in its 10 solidly Republican counties. And he must max out support among evangelicals, who dominate in southeastern Ohio.Turnout, turnout, turnout. Pew Research reports that 78% of evangelicals say they'll vote for Mr. Trump -- if they show up. Not enough did for Mitt Romney, who had polled at 75% among evangelicals.The blue-collar towns running west of Cleveland, from Parma out to Toledo have endured manufacturing losses and should be ripe for Mr. Trump's appeal.At the same time, the Cleveland metropolitan area has experienced an economic renaissance led by the Cleveland Clinic and a galaxy of companies related to health care and medical equipment and the service industries that support them. This ""new"" Ohio economy also radiates outward from Columbus and Cincinnati. And much of the new economy depends on exports. These voters like Nafta and trade with Asia. So do Ohio's exporting soybean farmers.If, as recent polling has suggested, Mr. Trump's temperament costs him votes at the margin among upscale and suburban Republican voters, that could wash out any gains among Ohio Democrats.Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Obama by nine points in Ohio's 2008 presidential primary. I watched her that week wow three audiences of mostly blue-collar women. She knows how to pitch in Ohio, but she was a woman of the center then. Will they still believe the post-Bernie version of the same woman?Her campaign will spend millions appealing to, or frightening, suburban Republicans. Anti-Trump TV ads already on the air in Ohio by the Hillary-supporting super PAC Priorities USA Action are a fraction of what is coming.The result in Ohio, like the outcome for the nation, may ultimately turn on which of these two unpopular candidates can dig the most votes out of the other's anxious and disaffected base.From Cleveland on Lake Erie down to Cincinnati on the Kentucky border, Ohio's voters historically have demanded hands-on attention before they pick the next president. For now, Donald Trump is campaigning for this must-win state with not much more than the Trump brand. There's a first time for everything.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",10/11/16
'Spy' Magazine Returns in Digital Form --- Raucous humor magazine will turn lens on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1827819097?accountid=12768,"It was probably inevitable. With Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump battling for the presidency, Spy magazine is returning to chronicle every daily twist and turn of the campaign's final stretch.In its new iteration, Spy is resurfacing as a short-lived digital pop-up that will be available on Esquire magazine's website, Esquire.com. The new edition launched Tuesday and will last appear on Election Day. Esquire is owned by closely held Hearst Corp.""We're pleased to do a quick sprint,"" said David Carey, president of Hearst Magazines. ""You never know where something like this may lead.""Spy, a raucous humor magazine, was co-founded in 1986 by Graydon Carter, now editor of Vanity Fair; author Kurt Andersen, and Tom Phillips. In its day Spy lampooned many of the rich and famous, describing Mr. Trump as a ""short-fingered vulgarian"" and portraying Mrs. Clinton on the February 1993 cover as clad in a leather dominatrix outfit.The publication was sold in 1994 to investor Jo Colman, chief executive and owner of Psychology Today. Mr. Colman closed Spy in 1998 but retained ownership. Mr. Colman said that he has licensed Spy to Hearst Corp. for the length of the digital edition.The new Spy has a staff of four led by special projects editor Josh Wolk. It is launching with six to eight stories. Spy hopes to publish as many as five original pieces daily. Wieden & Kennedy is overseeing advertising.""It's a fearless project, and we're happy to be involved,"" said Colleen DeCourcy, global executive creative director, via an email.Mr. Andersen said in an interview that he is among those contributing to the first day's edition.""I wish it well,"" he said. ""It's amazing that it's back in the picture."" Mr. Andersen's piece is in the form of an introductory letter to readers.Fans can expect to find new versions of such classic Spy features as ""Separated at Birth"" and ""Logrolling in Our Time."" Some original Spy stories may also be republished.""There may be a lot of humor surrounding this election, but there's ample room for Spy's special appreciation of the absurd,"" said Jay Fielden, who became Esquire's editor in chief last April after having served as editor of sister magazine Town & Country. ""Spy's past dovetails with the rise of the two people running for president. It will be a fact-based journalistic satire digitally reimagined.""Mr. Fielden, who remains editorial director of Town & Country, added that Nov. 8 will be the edition's last day ""unless there are any hanging chads.""Credit: By Jeffrey A.

Trump Adviser Tries to Clarify Carried Interest Policy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828293566?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's economic advisers attempted Thursday to clear up an ambiguity in how the Republican candidate's tax plan would treat private equity managers and other business owners.Investor Wilbur Ross, speaking at a Tax Policy Center event in Washington, said that carried interest--the manager's share of profits from others' investments--wouldn't be eligible for campaign's proposed 15% business tax rate. Instead, it would be taxed as ordinary income at a top rate of 33%.""My carried interest and everyone else's would not be eligible for the 15% rate,"" he said.Mr. Ross also insisted that it wouldn't be possible for people to convert their individual income into business income to take advantage of the gap between the 33% and 15% rates.Critics, including Hillary Clinton's campaign, have warned about such arbitrage, and the Trump campaign has given shifting explanations over the past month on how the plan would work. The most consistent statement has been that businesses that now pay one layer of taxes through their owners' tax returns could get the 15% rate but that at least some of them would have to pay a second layer of tax on capital gains or dividends.Already, the U.S. has difficulty preventing people from exploiting smaller rate differentials than that 18-point gap. The details, Mr. Ross said, will be worked out when Congress drafts legislation.""If all the people in Washington, all the lawyers and all the tax experts, can't figure out how to draft a simple thing like that successfully, they all ought to quit,"" he said.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comCredit: By Richard Rubin",10/13/16

Tech Boom Creates Too Few Jobs --- Dashed employment promises of the 1990s fuel Donald Trump's political rise; $7-an-hour robots,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828142661?accountid=12768,"The technology revolution has delivered Google searches, Facebook friends, iPhone apps, Twitter rants and shopping for almost anything on Amazon, all in the past decade and a half.What it hasn't delivered are many jobs. Google's Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. had at the end of last year a total of 74,505 employees, about one-third fewer than Microsoft Corp. even though their combined stock-market value is twice as big. Photo-sharing service Instagram had 13 employees when it was acquired for $1 billion by Facebook in 2012.Hiring in the computer and chip sectors dove after companies shifted hardware production outside the U.S., and the newest tech giants needed relatively few workers. The number of technology startups fizzled. Growth in productivity and wages slowed, and income inequality rose as machines replaced routine, low- and middle-income, human-powered work.This outcome is a far cry from what many political leaders, tech entrepreneurs and economists predicted about a generation ago. In 2000, President Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address: ""America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology."" His economic team trumpeted ""the ferment of rapid technological change"" as one of the U.S. economy's ""principal engines"" of growth.The gap between what the tech boom promised and delivered is another source of the rumbling national discontent that powered the rise this year of political outsiders Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.The tech-powered disappointment is subtler than the anger caused by the crushing impact of China's import invasion and the perceived failures of government institutions like the Federal Reserve in guiding the economy. Instead, it stems from the idea that Americans expected larger economic gains from these amazing new machines and their creators, not a widening between the haves and have-nots.""There is a growing sense of frustration that people haven't seen the progress that their parents and grandparents did,"" says Erik Brynjolfsson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose work has chronicled how technology widens the income gap between rich and poor. ""That frustration spills into the political arena.""In 1997, Time magazine named computer-chip maker Intel Corp.'s chief executive, Andrew S. Grove, who died in March 2016, as ""Man of the Year.""Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos won in 1999. Companies spent billions of dollars reprogramming their computers for the Year 2000 bug, and profitless dot-com startups won giant valuations from optimistic investors.The bursting of the dot-com bubble in early 2000, the recession in 2001 and deepening globalization proved to be turning points for the tech economy and its broader impact on American prosperity.U.S. tech companies accelerated the reshuffling of their supply networks to China and elsewhere in Asia, places filled with growth potential and cheap labor. Hardware makers concentrated production overseas to supply U.S. and foreign computer makers.After rising through the 1990s, total employment at computer and electronic firms in the U.S. sank to 1.03 million in August 2016 from 1.87 million in 2001, according to Labor Department statistics. Employment at semiconductor makers fell by half to 359,000 in the same period.In the 1990s, Micron Technology Inc. was a successful example of how far the tech industry reached beyond its nexus in Silicon Valley. Based in Boise, Idaho, Micron was founded by Idaho farmers and businessmen, including the late billionaire J.R. Simplot, who supplied McDonald's Corp. with most of its frozen french fries and had ""MR SPUD"" license plates on his pickup truck.Micron's workforce quadrupled to 18,800 between 1994 and 2000, with the growth overwhelmingly in the U.S. The company fought with Japan in the 1980s to restrict imported memory chips and protect its U.S. base.These days, Micron is a case study in how technology companies have exported jobs to other countries. As of 2013, the most recently disclosed data, Micron had 11,300 workers in the U.S., down from 14,000 in 2000. The company's non-U.S. workforce surged to 19,600, mainly in China and other Asian nations, from 4,800.Securities filings show that the percentage of employees at Micron who were in the U.S. shrank to 37% from 74% in the same period. The company stopped disclosing the annual percentage in 2014. A Micron spokesman says much of the growth outside the U.S. came from acquisitions.""What we're doing is replacing more resources there to support the growing customer base -- both the multinationals that are leveraging the low labor-cost areas in China, in particular, as well as the indigenous Chinese manufacturers,"" Mike Sadler, Micron's head of sales, told analysts in 2004. He is now Micron's strategic chief.The Semiconductor Industry Association says semiconductors remain a big U.S. business and are America's third-largest export, trailing cars and aircraft.Apple Inc. followed a similar path. Co-founder Steve Jobs made it a mission early in his Apple career and after creating NeXT Inc., another computer maker, to revitalize U.S. manufacturing. Macintosh computers rolled off the line at an Apple factory ""like a Holiday Inn toaster turns out toasted bagels,"" says Brent Schlender, who co-wrote a biography of Mr. Jobs.By the time Mr. Jobs died in 2011, Apple made nearly every one of its products outside America, largely in Asia. Apple halted U.S. manufacturing in 2004 and didn't resume until 2013, when it began producing Mac Pro personal computers in Austin, Texas.Apple says it employs about 80,000 workers in the U.S., or two-thirds of the company's overall workforce. About half the U.S. employees have retail jobs. An Apple spokeswoman says it is ""creating jobs in new industries like the App Economy,"" or apps for the iPhone, and is ""a major contributor to U.S. manufacturing"" by buying American-made components and materials.Mr. Schlender says it made sense to assemble the iPod outside the U.S. when production began in 2001. ""The components were hard to make, and putting them together was a labor-intensive job because everything was so small,"" he says. ""You had to piece it together by hand.""The computer-hardware exodus spread. International Business Machines Corp., the company that turned computers into a big business, was born in Endicott, N.Y., and built its first factories there.From 2001 to 2015, though, employment in computer and electronics manufacturing in surrounding Broome County fell about two-thirds to 3,055 jobs. Warehouses and transportation companies scooped up some laid-off workers at salaries of less than half those paid in high-tech manufacturing, says Christian Harris, an analyst for the New York State Department of Labor.American tech workers are getting a smaller piece of the pie created from what they produce. As of 2014, employee compensation in computer and electronic-parts making was equal to 49% of the value of the industry's output, down from 79% in 1999, according to the Commerce Department.While other tech jobs have been created in sectors such as software publishing, that growth is smaller than the losses in tech manufacturing.Since 2002, the number of technology startups has slowed, hurting job creation. In a 2014 study, economists Javier Miranda, John Haltiwanger and Ian Hathaway said the growth of tech startups accelerated to 113,000 in 2001 from 64,000 in 1992.That number slumped to 79,000 in 2011 and hasn't recovered, according to the economists' calculations using updated data. The causes include global competition and increased domestic regulation, says Mr. Haltiwanger, an economics professor at the University of Maryland.Another problem is that fewer tech companies have gone public, which can enrich early employees and spawn more jobs as companies grow.Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business, says there were 548 initial public offerings of technology-related companies from 2001 to 2015. From 1990 to 2000, 1,853 went public.The latest generation of hot tech startups has attracted a mountain of venture-capital funding and gigantic valuations, led by Uber Technologies Inc., which was worth $68 billion as of June.The influx of wealth has created more prosperity in Silicon Valley but exemplifies the economic polarization rippling through America.WhatsApp had more than 450 million users world-wide when Facebook bought the messaging service for $19 billion in 2014, turning founder Jan Koum into a billionaire several times over. At the time, WhatsApp had 55 employees.Economists call the phenomenon ""skill-biased technical change."" The spoils of growth go to those few people with skills and luck and who are best positioned to take advantage of new technology.The five largest U.S.-based technology companies by stock-market value -- Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Oracle Corp. -- are worth $1.8 trillion today. That is 80% more than the five largest tech companies in 2000.Today's five giants have 22% fewer workers than their predecessors, or a total of 434,505 as of last year, compared with 556,523 at Cisco Systems Inc., Intel, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft in 2000.Amazon uses 45,000 small robots at about one-third of its U.S. warehouses to automate order processing. The robots look like bread boxes on wheels, lifting modular shelves stuffed with products and carrying the shelves to workers who pick out pieces.An Amazon spokesman says the company has added about 200,000 employees since it began using the robots in early 2012. Amazon has 268,000 employees world-wide.Robots aren't dexterous enough yet to identify different sized-packages, pick the right ones and place them safely in boxes, says Mr. Brynjolfsson, the MIT economist. That is the fundamental skill in warehousing. Researchers now are trying to automate that part of the job, too.In coming decades, machines are likely to replace new forms of routine work done by humans. From 1991 to 2001, the number of secretaries declined about 35%. The number of textile and apparel workers fell 37%.For a long time, those with bachelor's degrees in science seemed to be safe from automation-related layoffs because their cognitive knowledge was tough for computers to duplicate. Less-educated workers who dispense personal service, such as home health aides or masseuses, also seemed safe.Harvard University economist David Deming estimates that the hollowing-out of work spread to programmers, librarians and engineers between 2000 and 2012. As much as $2 trillion worth of human economic activity could be automated away using existing technologies, such as Amazon's robots, in coming years, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates.Knightscope Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., makes robots that serve as night watchmen. About three dozen are on patrol, including at shopping malls, corporate campuses such as Microsoft's in Mountain View and the new home arena of the Sacramento Kings. Knightscope clients pay $7 an hour per robot.""Robots don't complain,"" says Stacy Stephens, a Knightscope co-founder. ""There's no pension. And there's no worker's comp,"" he adds.Credit: By Jon Hilsenrath and Bob Davis",10/13/16

"Should Christians Vote for Trump? Trump's behavior is odious, but Clinton has a deplorable basketful of deal breakers.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828011152?accountid=12768,"This question should hardly require an essay, but let's face it: We're living in strange times. America is in trouble.Over this past year many of Donald Trump's comments have made me almost literally hopping mad. The hot-mic comments from 2005 are especially horrifying. Can there be any question we should denounce them with flailing arms and screeching volume? I must not hang out in the right locker rooms, because if anyone I know said such things I might assault him physically (and repent later). So yes, many see these comments as a deal breaker.But we have a very knotty and larger problem. What if the other candidate also has deal breakers? Even a whole deplorable basketful? Suddenly things become horribly awkward. Would God want me simply not to vote? Is that a serious option?What if not pulling the lever for Mr. Trump effectively means electing someone who has actively enabled sexual predation in her husband before--and while--he was president? Won't God hold me responsible for that? What if she defended a man who raped a 12-year-old and in recalling the case laughed about getting away with it? Will I be excused from letting this person become president? What if she used her position as secretary of state to funnel hundreds of millions into her own foundation, much of it from nations that treat women and gay people worse than dogs? Since these things are true, can I escape responsibility for them by simply not voting?Many say they won't vote because choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil. But this is sophistry. Neither candidate is pure evil. They are human beings. We cannot escape the uncomfortable obligation to soberly choose between them. Not voting--or voting for a third candidate who cannot win--is a rationalization designed more than anything to assuage our consciences. Yet people in America and abroad depend on voters to make this very difficult choice.Children in the Middle East are forced to watch their fathers drowned in cages by ISIS. Kids in inner-city America are condemned to lives of poverty, hopelessness and increasing violence. Shall we sit on our hands and simply trust ""the least of these"" to God, as though that were our only option? Don't we have an obligation to them?Two heroes about whom I've written faced similar difficulties. William Wilberforce, who ended the slave trade in the British Empire, often worked with other parliamentarians he knew to be vile and immoral in their personal lives.Why did he? First, because as a sincere Christian he knew he must extend grace and forgiveness to others, since he desperately needed them himself. Second, because he knew the main issue was not his moral purity, nor the moral impurity of his colleagues, but rather the injustices and horrors suffered by the African slaves whose cause he championed. He knew that before God his first obligation was to them, and he must do what he could to help them.The anti-Nazi martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer also did things most Christians of his day were disgusted by. He most infamously joined a plot to kill the head of his government. He was horrified by it, but he did it nonetheless because he knew that to stay ""morally pure"" would allow the murder of millions to continue. Doing nothing or merely ""praying"" was not an option. He understood that God was merciful, and that even if his actions were wrong, God saw his heart and could forgive him. But he knew he must act.Wilberforce and Bonhoeffer knew it was an audience of One to whom they would ultimately answer. And He asks, ""What did you do to the least of these?""It's a fact that if Hillary Clinton is elected, the country's chance to have a Supreme Court that values the Constitution--and the genuine liberty and self-government for which millions have died--is gone. Not for four years, or eight, but forever. Many say Mr. Trump can't be trusted to deliver on this score, but Mrs. Clinton certainly can be trusted in the opposite direction. For our kids and grandkids, are we not obliged to take our best shot at this? Shall we sit on our hands and refuse to choose?If imperiously flouting the rules by having a private server endangered American lives and secrets and may lead to more deaths, if she cynically deleted thousands of emails, and if her foreign-policy judgment led to the rise of Islamic State, won't refusing to vote make me responsible for those suffering as a result of these things? How do I squirm out of this horrific conundrum? It's unavoidable: We who can vote must answer to God for these people, whom He loves. We are indeed our brothers' and sisters' keepers.We would be responsible for passively electing someone who champions the abomination of partial-birth abortion, someone who is celebrated by an organization that sells baby parts. We already live in a country where judges force bakers, florists and photographers to violate their consciences and faith--and Mrs. Clinton has zealously ratified this. If we believe this ends with bakers and photographers, we are horribly mistaken. No matter your faith or lack of faith, this statist view of America will dramatically affect you and your children.For many of us, this is very painful, pulling the lever for someone many think odious. But please consider this: A vote for Donald Trump is not necessarily a vote for Donald Trump himself. It is a vote for those who will be affected by the results of this election. Not to vote is to vote. God will not hold us guiltless.Mr. Metaxas, host of the nationally syndicated ""Eric Metaxas Show,"" is the author of ""If You Can Keep It: The Forgotten Promise of American Liberty"" (Viking, 2016).Related Articles* Jason Riley: Is Trump Taking the GOP Down With Him?* Scott Gant and Bruce Peabody: A Path to President Pence* Joseph Rago: The Libertarians Make Their CaseCredit: By Eric Metaxas",10/13/16
"The Press Buries Hillary Clinton's Sins; As reporters focus on Trump, they miss new details on Clinton's rotten record.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828362444?accountid=12768,"If average voters turned on the TV for five minutes this week, chances are they know that Donald Trump made lewd remarks a decade ago and now stands accused of groping women.But even if average voters had the TV on 24/7, they still probably haven't heard the news about Hillary Clinton: That the nation now has proof of pretty much everything she has been accused of.It comes from hacked emails dumped by WikiLeaks, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, and accounts from FBI insiders. The media has almost uniformly ignored the flurry of bombshells, preferring to devote its front pages to the Trump story. So let's review what amounts to a devastating case against a Clinton presidency.Start with a June 2015 email to Clinton staffers from Erika Rottenberg, the former general counsel of LinkedIn. Ms. Rottenberg wrote that none of the attorneys in her circle of friends ""can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents."" She added: ""It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I've either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc.""A few months later, in a September 2015 email, a Clinton confidante fretted that Mrs. Clinton was too bullheaded to acknowledge she'd done wrong. ""Everyone wants her to apologize,"" wrote Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress. ""And she should. Apologies are like her Achilles' heel.""Clinton staffers debated how to evade a congressional subpoena of Mrs. Clinton's emails--three weeks before a technician deleted them. The campaign later employed a focus group to see if it could fool Americans into thinking the email scandal was part of the Benghazi investigation (they are separate) and lay it all off as a Republican plot.A senior FBI official involved with the Clinton investigation told Fox News this week that the ""vast majority"" of career agents and prosecutors working the case ""felt she should be prosecuted"" and that giving her a pass was ""a top-down decision.""The Obama administration--the federal government, supported by tax dollars--was working as an extension of the Clinton campaign. The State Department coordinated with her staff in responding to the email scandal, and the Justice Department kept her team informed about developments in the court case.Worse, Mrs. Clinton's State Department, as documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show, took special care of donors to the Clinton Foundation. In a series of 2010 emails, a senior aide to Mrs. Clinton asked a foundation official to let her know which groups offering assistance with the Haitian earthquake relief were ""FOB"" (Friends of Bill) or ""WJC VIPs"" (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs). Those who made the cut appear to have been teed up for contracts. Those who weren't? Routed to a standard government website.The leaks show that the foundation was indeed the nexus of influence and money. The head of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Ira Magaziner, suggested in a 2011 email that Bill Clinton call Sheikh Mohammed of Saudi Arabia to thank him for offering the use of a plane. In response, a top Clinton Foundation official wrote: ""Unless Sheikh Mo has sent us a $6 million check, this sounds crazy to do.""The entire progressive apparatus--the Clinton campaign and boosters at the Center for American Progress--appears to view voters as stupid and tiresome, segregated into groups that must either be cajoled into support or demeaned into silence. We read that Republicans are attracted to Catholicism's ""severely backwards gender relations"" and only join the faith to ""sound sophisticated""; that Democratic leaders such as Bill Richardson are ""needy Latinos""; that Bernie Sanders supporters are ""self-righteous""; that the only people who watch Miss America ""are from the confederacy""; and that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is ""a terrorist.""The leaks also show that the press is in Mrs. Clinton's pocket. Donna Brazile, a former Clinton staffer and a TV pundit, sent the exact wording of a coming CNN town hall question to the campaign in advance of the event. Other media allowed the Clinton camp to veto which quotes they used from interviews, worked to maximize her press events and offered campaign advice.Mrs. Clinton has been exposed to have no core, to be someone who constantly changes her position to maximize political gain. Leaked speeches prove that she has two positions (public and private) on banks; two positions on the wealthy; two positions on borders; two positions on energy. Her team had endless discussions about what positions she should adopt to appease ""the Red Army""--i.e. ""the base of the Democratic Party.""Voters might not know any of this, because while both presidential candidates have plenty to answer for, the press has focused solely on taking out Mr. Trump. And the press is doing a diligent job of it.Write to kim@wsj.com.Credit: By Kimberley A. Strassel",10/14/16
Notable & Quotable: Trump's Dumbed-Down America; 'Who did the dumbing down? Our public schools? Our universities?',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828029813?accountid=12768,"The Weekly Standard's Andrew Ferguson, writing Oct. 6 , on an article about Donald Trump in Vanity Fair by that magazine's editor, Graydon Carter:One of the weirder aspects of anti-Trump mania is its sniffy tone. And it's especially weird coming from card-carrying liberal Democrats. For two generations our culture and its institutions have been living under a liberal ascendancy. The country's elites--the Bigs of the news media and Hollywood and the non-profit world and the arts and the academy--have signed on to a catechism of personal liberation, particularly sexual liberation, and a kind of radical individual autonomy that even lets you choose whether you're a boy or a girl. We are taught to be ""nonjudgmental"" in matters of lifestyle and to accept a pristine relativism in metaphysics and morality. . . .Carter's piece raises one further question, coming as it does from a credentialed member of the country's cultural elite. He calls the Trump ascendancy the ""final stage of a dumbed down America."" Who could disagree? Trump's rise, boosted by the forty percent of our fellow citizens who see him as a plausible president, is indeed evidence of a serious, system-wide failure. Dumbing down is a good name for it.The question is, Who did the dumbing down? Our public schools? Our universities? Our entertainment media--television, movies, popular music? The press? Glossy magazines like Vanity Fair?Surely all of them share in the blame. And all of them, from the schools to movie studios, rest snugly (I almost wrote ""smugly"") in the control of liberal Democrats, and have done so for fifty years or more. If we're getting dumber, we know whom to thank. How odd is their sniffy contempt for Donald Trump, the purest flowering of the culture they've created.",10/14/16
October Is for Halloween--Not Voting; Wait for Election Day. Clinton or Trump may change your mind.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1829397844?accountid=12768,"The election is still three weeks away, and hundreds of thousands of Americans have already voted. Yet in politics a lot can happen in only a few days: Donald Trump has recently been accused of groping women, and leaked emails show Hillary Clinton's staff mocking Catholics. How many Americans who voted before those revelations wish they could get their ballots back?California launched the early-voting mania in 1978, when it first allowed no-excuse absentee ballots. Today 37 states and the District of Columbia allow residents to vote early, with no need to state why they can't show up on Election Day. In Minnesota early voting began on Sept. 23, a full month and a half before the election. President Obama voted on Oct. 7 and encouraged others to follow his lead.All this has dramatically changed the character of American elections. In 1992 only 7% of presidential ballots were cast early. The figure rose to 31.6% by 2012. For nearly a third of the electorate, the last month--or more--of campaigning is irrelevant. Two of the three presidential debates were effectively written off. Candidates could be exposed for past indiscretions. They could withdraw or even die.Imagine a town meeting convened to decide an important matter. For convenience, ballots are distributed when residents arrive. Yet numerous people return their ballots and leave before the time designated for public comments. At best it will be clear that those who left are not interested in anyone else's opinions. At worst it makes a mockery of the democratic process that citizens thought they were engaged in.The usual arguments in favor of early voting are that it makes casting a ballot more convenient and improves turnout. Is this true? In the 1992 presidential election, 55.2% of the voting-age population cast ballots . In 2012 it was a bit lower, 54.9%. Why would that be? A study from 2013 by four professors at the University of Wisconsin posits that early voting reduces ""the civic significance of elections.""But even if early voting did increase turnout, it isn't clear why turnout is a valuable goal in itself. If some people are uninterested--and possibly uniformed--why would anyone want to urge them toward the polls?Proponents of early voting also claim that the inconvenience of showing up at a specified location on Election Day disproportionately affects racial minorities, the poor and workers without flexible schedules. But to the extent that this is true, other accommodations--adding more polling places in better locations, extending polling hours, making Election Day a state or national holiday--would better fix the problem.Traditional absentee voting--commonly allowed for sickness, physical disability, religious observance or prolonged absence overseas--imposes minimal burdens while not undercutting the civic benefits of a single election day. But no-excuse early voting presumes that Americans have fixed views and that the candidates cannot say or do anything to influence them in the final weeks of the campaign. In that sense it is a corruption of the democratic process--one that accepts and encourages the partisan divisions that plague modern American politics and poison the civic spirit.Mr. Huffman is the dean emeritus of Lewis & Clark Law School and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.Credit: By James Huffman",10/17/16
Investors May Be Misjudging U.S. Election Volatility; VIX could spring back should polls tighten between Clinton and Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828833793?accountid=12768,"Stock investors jolted by the volatility spike after the British referendum are overlooking the potential for another shock from the U.S. election, Wall Street analysts say.""Brexit was a big wake-up call. Investors knew that the likelihood of the Leave camp succeeding was greater than zero but they still underestimated the odds and few people hedged ahead of the vote,"" said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research. With the U.S. presidential election, ""there's a little too much complacency. As we approach election, volatility will probably creep up.""The options market is indicating a 1.6% swing by the S&P 500 index in the week after the Nov. 8 voting day, based on contracts expiring before and after that day, according to BNP Paribas SA.The implied move seems humble versus the outsize jump in stock market turbulence after the unexpected outcome of the U.K. vote, said Anand Omprakash, the New York-based director of equity & derivative strategy at BNP.The S&P 500 tumbled 5% in two days after the June vote by Britons to leave the European Union and dropped 2.5% on Sept. 9 as hawkish-sounding Federal Reserve officials compounded worries that central banks wouldn't be as accommodative.The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, has averaged 14.5 since Sept. 9. While that is higher than the multiyear lows reached in the summer, the average is still significantly below the measure's five-year average and could spring back should polls tighten between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate who represents the status quo, and Donald Trump, a Washington outsider.""Volatility is reasonably priced in light of what happened after the British referendum in June and extremely inexpensive given the political climate,"" Mr. Omprakash said. ""Past elections haven't been as consequential as this one with the potential for uncertainty. Investors know what they're getting with Hillary Clinton but there's concern that she won't win.""Mr. Trump trailed Mrs. Clinton by 4 percentage points in North Carolina, and was ahead by 1 point in Ohio, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday.The S&P 500's lackluster advance this year is further deterring investors from loading up on pricey hedges as they look to lock in returns for 2016. ""They don't want to spend for premium positioning if they're already in a good spot,"" Mr. Omprakash said.BNP recommends a trade that allows investors to be long December volatility. Investors should buy puts and calls on the S&P 500 expiring mid-December at strike prices closest to where the gauge is trading--a trade known as a straddle--while also selling contracts that expire on Nov. 11.Research firm Cornerstone Macro said in a note last month that investors can gain cheap exposure to the election by selling Nov. 4 calls on exchange-traded funds that track the small-cap Russell 2000 index and S&P 500 Technology stocks, while simultaneously buying calls that expire one week later-- a strategy that wagers on an increase in volatility while offsetting the cost of the trade.Investors can also bet on upcoming central bank meetings by putting on the inverse version of the trade with ETFs tracking utility, energy and consumer-staple companies, Cornerstone said.In the last six elections, the VIX has always climbed higher in the month leading up to a U.S. election, by an average of 3.5 points, according to Credit Suisse Group AG's Mandy Xu.Adding to risks this year are lofty valuations for U.S. equities and polls showing a potential switch up in the U.S. Senate in a month that has seen wilder price swings in the past, said Chris Rogers of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. The S&P 500 is trading at 16.6 times reported profits in the next year, FactSet data show.""Historically, October has been a month that's seen more market gyrations,"" said Mr. Rogers, the New York-based director of capital markets advisory services at BNY. ""There is a perception of calm out there. That the market move may not be extraordinary but will be a slow melt up.""But spikes in volatility have been more dramatic when they occur with central banks artificially suppressing price swings, said BNP's Mr. Omprakash. That has boosted the popularity of carry trades in which investors sell VIX futures or short a volatility ETP to profit from the difference in prices between closer-dated contracts and longer-dated ones.""A lot of these trades have been done on the back of confidence that central banks will step in when necessary,"" he said. ""Should central banks surprise negatively, markets could erupt violently"" as short bets are unwound at the same time as risk-on long positions.Investors who see Mr. Trump winning can buy options on stocks that should outperform if he wins, such as student lenders, for-profit colleges, auto-part retailers and energy companies such as refiners and master-limited partnerships, Ms. Xu, Credit Suisse's equity derivatives strategist, wrote in a note this month. Alternatively, those who predict a victory by Mrs. Clinton should buy calls on hospital, Medicaid-care, regional-bank and higher-education companies.Write to Inyoung Hwang at ihwang@wsj.com@wsj.comCredit: By Inyoung Hwang",10/17/16
Trump Chooses Indiana's Pence as Running Mate,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803999883?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has chosen Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to be his vice-presidential running mate, teaming up with a staunch conservative and seasoned politician who balances his own freewheeling style and outsider appeal, according to senior Republicans close to the process.Mr. Trump was scheduled to announce his choice Friday in New York but postponed it ""in light of the horrible attack in Nice, France."" Trump campaign officials and Mr. Trump himself on Thursday night refused to confirm the choice, but senior GOP officials and Pence supporters said they were told to prepare for Mr. Pence to be introduced.In one of the most important decisions the presumptive GOP nominee will make, the selection of the conventionally qualified, low-key Mr. Pence would mark a departure for Mr. Trump, a rare occasion on which the mercurial candidate made what was considered a cautious choice.Naming a running mate is one of the last hurdles to his ascension as the party's nominee next week at the Republican convention in Cleveland.Late Thursday, Mr. Trump's allies in Cleveland tamped down dissident delegates in pre-convention negotiations. The convention's Rules Committee rejected moves to allow convention delegates bound to Mr. Trump to vote for someone else.Mr. Trump had been under pressure to announce his running-mate choice this week, in part because as a candidate for re-election as Indiana governor, Mr. Pence faces a Friday deadline for taking his name off the ballot. State law would prohibit him from appearing twice on the ballot -- for governor and vice president. As of late Thursday, Mr. Pence hadn't filed the paperwork to do so, but had until noon Friday to do it.Some measure of suspense about Mr. Pence's selection lingered -- especially after the Friday event was postponed -- because Mr. Trump has been so unpredictable throughout the 2016 campaign. But Republicans were so primed for Mr. Pence to be named that if Mr. Trump doesn't announce him, it would be the biggest bombshell in a campaign pockmarked with them.Mr. Pence, who flew to New York from Indianapolis Thursday, has a long government resume and deep conservative political roots that would make him a safer choice than two other finalists for the job -- former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- who mirror Mr. Trump's combative, colorful style.Mr. Pence could provide a kind of ballast that some Republicans think Mr. Trump needs to run a more conventional campaign. He has also been a leader on hot-button social issues -- opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage -- that could reassure the party's activist base while also risking alienating independent voters or centrist Republicans.Mr. Pence once described himself as ""a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order."" His fierce opposition to gay marriage, abortion and President Barack Obama's health-care law has made him a star for the far right. He also has strong ties to Congress, where he was a House member for 12 years and a member of party leadership for two years before 2013, when he became governor. He could help Mr. Trump improve relations with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), who was close to Mr. Pence while they served in the House together.""It's no secret I'm a big fan of Mike Pence's -- we're very good friends,"" Mr. Ryan told reporters Thursday.Joining the ticket will require some adjustments as Mr. Pence has taken positions on key issues that put him at odds with Mr. Trump. He opposed the Trump proposal to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. He has supported free-trade agreements that Mr. Trump has lambasted. And he supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Mr. Trump now criticizes.In advance of the GOP primary in Indiana in May, Mr. Pence endorsed Mr. Trump's rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. But he made a point of praising Mr. Trump as well. After Mr. Cruz suspended his campaign, Mr. Pence endorsed Mr. Trump and pledged to ""campaign hard for the Republican nominee, because Indiana needs a partner in the White House.""Adding a Hoosier could help Mr. Trump broaden his appeal in Midwestern swing states. However, Mr. Pence hasn't been in a commanding position even in his home state: He has been facing a stiff Democratic challenge in his current bid for re-election as governor.As governor, Mr. Pence has presided over an economic recovery in an industrial state badly battered by the recent recession. He touts the job growth and the drop in unemployment in the state. But Democrats have charged that his pursuit of antigay social policies threatened to drive business away.The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed in March 2015, received national backlash from critics who said the bill would allow businesses not to serve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. Mr. Pence was forced to sign a revised bill after several businesses condemned the law, including Angie's List, which went so far as to cancel a $40 million expansion of its headquarters in Indianapolis.---Kristina Peterson and Reid J.

A Trump Economy Beats Clinton's,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803991953?accountid=12768,"Certain business leaders and prominent conservatives have denounced Donald Trump's economic policies and even argued that Hillary Clinton would be a better choice in November. This is hard to fathom. Although we disagree with him on some issues, we have both signed on as economic advisers to Mr. Trump because we are confident in the direction he would take the country.What could possibly be the economic case for Mrs. Clinton? She has vowed to defend President Obama's ""legacy"" and double down on job-killers like ObamaCare. Even Bill Clinton knows that the status quo hasn't worked: In March he told a crowd that it is time to ""put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us.""Since the end of the recession, economic growth has averaged an anemic 2.1%, producing the weakest ""recovery"" since the Great Depression. That has slowed to 1.4% in the last quarter of 2015 and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2016. The middle class is shrinking, and median household income today, in real terms, is lower than when Mr. Obama took office. By more than two to one, Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.What does Mr. Trump offer as an alternative?-- The biggest pro-growth tax cut since Ronald Reagan's 1981 reform. Mr. Trump would simplify the tax code and significantly reduce marginal rates, encouraging investment and economic expansion. His proposed corporate tax rate of 15% would make it easier for American firms to repatriate earnings, bringing capital home and making the U.S. a more hospitable place to invest. Mr. Trump's tax plan would do more for working-class and middle-class families than any scheme to redistribute income.Don't believe the phony claim that it will cost $10 trillion over a decade. As Americans will see when he reveals the entire plan in the next few weeks, any revenue loss would be a fraction of that amount.-- The repeal of ObamaCare, the fastest-growing entitlement program of all. Mr. Trump promises to replace the law with a consumer-choice health plan. He also wants to immediately repeal dozens of President Obama's antibusiness executive orders.-- A pro-growth energy policy. Mr. Trump wants to employ all of America's abundant resources -- oil, natural gas and coal. His plan could make America the world's No. 1 energy producer within five years, producing millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of extra output -- along with new royalty payments to the government. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, brags that she would put ""a lot of coal miners"" out of work.We don't see eye to eye with Mr. Trump on everything. In our opinion, legal immigrants are an asset to the country. We believe that deporting 11 million people is unworkable, and we hope in the end Mr. Trump comes to this same conclusion. Deportation should be pursued only when an illegal immigrant has committed a felony or become a ""public charge.""But the difference here is smaller than often portrayed. Although Mr. Trump is depicted as a close-the-doors nativist, he has said that he favors legal immigration, and he has hired thousands of legal immigrants. His proposals on illegal immigration -- to build a wall, increase enforcement of the law, deport criminal aliens, defund sanctuary cities, and reduce visa overstays -- are reasonable and sensible given that voters demand action.We are also free traders and oppose punitive tariffs. The U.S. needs trade. Yet it also must have a president willing to negotiate from a position of strength with countries that manipulate their currencies, steal Americans' intellectual property, or compel companies to disclose trade secrets as a condition of entering their markets. Negotiating better trade deals and enforcing the current ones would help the U.S. economy.Ideological purists miss a practical point. Right or wrong, working-class Americans believe that they disproportionately bear the burdens of free-trade deals. Taking a tougher stance might be necessary to restore dwindling support for open markets.Concern that Mr. Trump is a showman, temperamentally unsuited for the Oval Office, is misplaced. Running a successful business enterprise as CEO is an excellent qualification for the presidency. Mr. Trump has had prolonged success. He didn't fake that. We find it refreshing and uplifting that middle-class and working-class voters don't envy Mr. Trump or view him as an evil rich guy. Rather, they admire his success and want to emulate it.Trump's detractors love to point to his businesses that did not succeed. But one of the great things about the U.S. is that people can rise above their failures. Henry Ford and Steve Jobs did, and they changed the world. The skyscrapers that bear his name all over the world are evidence that Mr. Trump has maintained a level of success that few people ever achieve.Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination decisively against the best field of candidates that any party has put forth in modern times. To win the presidency, he will need to persuade millions of working-class voters that the party of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has abandoned them. In doing so, Mr. Trump will bring Reagan Democrats home to the GOP where they belong. Isn't this what the party has been trying to do for 30 years?---Mr. Puzder is chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants. Mr. Moore is a visiting economist at the Heritage Foundation.

"Election 2016: Ginsburg Regrets Her Criticism of Trump --- After a growing backlash, Supreme Court justice calls her comments 'ill advised'",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803991644?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg walked back her criticism of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on Thursday, but the spectacle of the Supreme Court's eldest member trading potshots with a potential president further enmeshed the judiciary in the 2016 election.""On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised, and I regret making them,"" Justice Ginsburg said in a written statement released by the Supreme Court. ""Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect.""In three media interviews over the past week, Justice Ginsburg, 83 years old and the court's senior liberal member, criticized Mr. Trump and his candidacy in increasingly sharp terms. ""At first I thought it was funny,"" she told CNN on Tuesday. She went on to call him ""a faker"" who was treated too gently by the media -- for instance, she said, he had ""gotten away"" without releasing his tax returns.Mr. Trump responded on Twitter. ""Her mind is shot -- resign!"" he tweeted earlier this week. On Thursday, the Trump campaign declined to comment on Justice Ginsburg's latest statement.The back and forth prompted a rare consensus by legal experts, politicians and editorial boards that Justice Ginsburg had crossed a line in criticizing Mr. Trump, despite the candidate's own attacks on Chief Justice John Roberts, several Supreme Court decisions and a federal judge handling litigation against Trump University.More broadly, observers bemoaned the blurring boundaries between the political and judicial branches, a trend reflected by polls that show an erosion in public confidence in the Supreme Court.Some observers said the damage done by the episode couldn't be undone. Her regret ""does not unring the bell,"" said Stephen Gillers, a New York University legal ethics scholar. Mr. Gillers said Justice Ginsburg's remarks could put her under pressure to recuse herself ""if the resolution of a case will determine whether Clinton or Trump becomes president.""""It seems like a proper moment to think of what are appropriate guidelines for all of the justices, rather than getting engaged in a very partisan effort at criticism"" of Justice Ginsburg alone, said Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society, a network of liberal lawyers and law students.Supreme Court justices aren't bound by the official code of conduct that governs other federal judges. The code states that judges ""may not publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.""The political spotlight on the court intensified after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, when Senate Republicans immediately vowed to prevent President Barack Obama from replacing the conservative icon. They have held firm, declining to grant a hearing to Mr. Obama's nominee, U.S. Judge Merrick Garland.In an interview published in Sunday's New York Times, Justice Ginsburg weighed in on that topic, too. Asked if the Senate should consider the nomination, she replied ""that's their job.""The court's modern trajectory toward the political sphere can be traced to December 2000, when it issued its extraordinary ruling in Bush v. Gore. The 5-4 split decided the presidential election and put George W. Bush in the White House by halting a Florida election recount with the Republican candidate ahead by 537 votes. That decision appalled Democrats, particularly because the majority justices all were appointed by Republicans.Republicans, for their part, have accused Chief Justice Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, of joining with the court's liberals to uphold much of the Affordable Care Act in 2012 and 2015 out of a desire for political comity.Mr. Trump repeatedly has criticized the chief justice for those votes. ""He could've killed it twice and he didn't,"" he said in a January radio interview. ""That was terrible.""Some conservatives say the problem has grown as the Democratically controlled executive branch and Republican-controlled Congress repeatedly clash, leading to efforts to have the judicial branch serve as a referee.""Part of the problem is the political branches can't seem to work out their disputes between themselves,"" said Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.---Jacob Gershman contributed to this article.Credit: By Jess Bravin and Mark H.

Trump's Pence Selection,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1803991542?accountid=12768,"There's nothing normal about Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, which is why his mooted choice of Mike Pence as his running mate is so refreshingly conventional. The Indiana Governor is a career politician with an optimistic mien who is popular across the Republican ideological spectrum. Assuming Mr. Trump doesn't change his mind overnight, Mr. Pence is the right kind of boring.The most prominent GOP choices for Vice President -- such as Marco Rubio or John Kasich -- said they didn't want to be considered. That left lesser-known figures unvetted by the media, or GOP warhorses like Newt Gingrich. Mr. Pence may be the best among the available choices in being able to reassure Republicans and handle the media scrutiny that invariably hits GOP running mates.The first-term Governor would reassure social conservatives who have doubts about Mr. Trump's campaign conversion to traditional values. He is also a free-marketeer, having voted against the Medicare drug expansion during his 12 years in Congress and cut individual and corporate tax rates in Indiana.His foreign-policy instincts are more Reaganesque than Trumpian. He favors a robust American role in the world and is known as a strong supporter of Israel. He also has a history as a free-trader, having voted for U.S. pacts with Central America, Australia, Singapore, Chile, Peru, Oman, Colombia and South Korea.Mr. Pence wrote last year to the Indiana congressional delegation in favor of President Obama's Pacific and European trade initiatives. ""I can tell you first-hand that TPP and TTIP provide an abundance of opportunities for Indiana businesses and will help to grow jobs in our state,"" he wrote. Mr. Trump opposes the Pacific pact, so Mr. Pence will have to explain these differences with Mr. Trump to voters -- though they are reassuring to those of us who fear the New Yorker would start a trade war.Mr. Pence is also a plausible governing pick, given his experience in Indianapolis and Congress. He was a friendly colleague of House Speaker Paul Ryan, and he could be an effective White House emissary to Capitol Hill. Mr. Trump's relations with congressional Republicans are nascent and wary, so voters may like the candidate's apparent self-recognition that he needs allies in the legislature.The 57-year-old Mr. Pence does come with some risks. He has never been vetted thoroughly in a national campaign, and the media will try to portray him as another too-eager sycophant. Hillary Clinton's researchers are no doubt listening to every available tape from his long career in talk radio hunting for political ammunition. It would be remarkable if they didn't find something.In 2015 Mr. Pence botched the handling of a religious liberty-gay rights flap in his state, which cost him support in the center and on the right. The political hangover has made him vulnerable as he has campaigned for re-election this year. More than a few of our Hoosier friends think he may want to join the Trump ticket in part to avoid the risk of defeat. If he does run with the businessman, Mr. Pence will have to drop out of the Indiana contest.These risks are probably worth taking if Mr. Pence can hold up under fire and rally GOP support. Mr. Trump has gained some ground in the polls since FBI Director James Comey's outline of her email lies last week. But Mr. Trump remains the underdog, in part because in most polls he is winning only some 80%, sometimes less, of Republicans.To win he'll need the votes of well over 90% of his own party, especially as Democrats consolidate behind Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump in particular needs to win over Republicans and independents with college degrees who dislike his crude populism, off-the-cuff insult-comedy and lack of policy knowledge.Mr. Pence is a conviction conservative who is also a nicer guy. That means he may have to adjust to the role of ""attack dog,"" as Mr. Trump told the Journal this week he wanted his running mate to be. Then again, Mr. Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will still be Trump surrogates even if they are passed over for VP.Running mates rarely make a difference in presidential contests, even when they are controversial, though they do increasingly matter in governing. But rarely has a nominee needed less political drama in a choice than Mr. Trump. His problem since becoming the presumptive GOP nominee is that he has been making the election about him. That's a losing strategy when your negative ratings are above 60%.Mr. Trump needs to present an optimistic alternative to the frustrations of the last eight years and a restoration of the Clinton dynasty. A safer VP choice fits that bill.",10/17/16
"Transcript: Lawrence Kudlow at WSJ Pro Financial Regulation Event; The full transcript of WSJ Pro's interview with Lawrence Kudlow, senior contributor, CNBC, and informal adviser to Donald Trump, at the Future of Financial Regulation Conference.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1829943075?accountid=12768,"Lawrence Kudlow, Senior Contributor, CNBC; Informal Adviser to Republican Presidential Nominee Donald TrumpInterviewer: Jamie Heller, Deputy Editor, Finance, The Wall Street JournalLocation: Four Seasons Hotel, New York City, New YorkTime: 3:30 p.m. EDTDate: Tuesday, October 18, 2016Transcript By Superior Transcriptions LLC www.superiortranscriptions.comJAMIE HELLER: Larry, thanks so much for being here. Let's just pick it up where the congressman left off. CFPB - is it as entrenched in the American culture now as he seems to suggest? Is it here to stay?LAWRENCE KUDLOW: It could be entrenched. I don't know. I think its structure would be changed if you had a Republican administration and a Republican Congress. I mean, that's a big if. But I think that the issues here - you just had a Court of Appeals decision in something that troubled me. What you have here - putting aside their mission and whether they're accomplishing their mission or not, the constitutionality of the agency has been called into question.First of all, as an old Fed guy - I actually worked as a secretary a long time ago to the New York Fed chairman, Paul Volcker - I don't know what it's doing inside the Fed. I don't know why it's financed by the Fed. Never seen anything like it. I'm not sure the Fed would like it there. So I also think the director has too much power and if the thing does survive it should be reset as a board for an independent commission, which is usually, let's say, two, two and one - two Democrats, two Republicans and then the president gets to choose the chairman.I think it should be subjected to congressional authorization and appropriation oversight. Right now, I think it's just, you know, way too powerful and runs against checks and balances that are normally used for these various independent agencies. So - oh, and I think the president should have greater power than just cause to remove it - him or her. So I think you've got to make big structural changes. I'll leave alone the mission. I'm not an expert on the mission. Some people like it, some people don't. There's a fair debate about that. But I think under a Republican, shall we say, three houses, you'll get some structural changes. Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Banking Committee - Financial Services Committee would like that as well.MS. HELLER: And what about Dodd-Frank and the congressman's assessment that it just needs some fine tuning? Is that your assessment?MR. KUDLOW: Well, actually, I'm inclined to agree with Barney on that. Barney is a friend of mine. We've debated many times - civilly, I might add - and there are a lot of issues swirling around Dodd-Frank. I'm not the best expert at every single detail in Dodd-Frank. I mean, what you hear from different banking organizations is, frankly, mixed. I think the smaller banks - the community banks don't like it.They feel it's overburdening them with regulations and red tape. They would argue that you already have all of these different regulatory agencies. You know, when I was a kid working at the New York Fed, in those days we had a big banking crisis in 1973 to '75. Banks were going under left and right. Arthur Burns, the then chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, made a speech where he said, essentially - I'm going to have to paraphrase - it was about 40 years go - but essentially said there's a crazy quilt of overlapping bank and supervisory bodies in the government. And, of course, you have federal and you have state, and then there's local. And the way I look at life, that's still true. That's basically still true.Now, I don't have a ready solution for it this afternoon. I've not given it enough thought. But it just strikes me that that's still a problem. Other people believe that Dodd-Frank and its red tape - I'm just going to use that word loosely - that may be unfair - have had a burdensome effect on loans, a burdensome effect on making institutions too big to fail, some of which have already been overturned. Some people want bankruptcy laws rather than the current system. So I don't know. I -MS. HELLER: Some say that it's great for the big banks because they're the only ones who could afford all this regulation.MR. KUDLOW: Yeah. I think that's a very fair point. I was reading one of the op-eds from my friend, Jeb Hensarling, and Jeb made the point that what you've had is more banks have become more powerful whereas smaller banks have become less powerful, less credit, and one interesting stat which needs to be pursued is that in the USA in the last 20 years, net new business formation has slumped very badly and as an economist I would say that's really the source of jobs. I mean, small businesses create jobs but it's the brand new businesses that have always made America, you know, kind of a super economy - sort of Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction. But they need credit.Now, bank credit is not the only source of financing but that's what you hear. There's probably something to that.MS. HELLER: So you have a new book out -MR. KUDLOW: Yes. Thank you.MS. HELLER: - ""JFK and the Reagan Revolution.""MR. KUDLOW: I forgot to bring my copy.MS. HELLER: And I'm reading it on my Kindle so -MR. KUDLOW: Thank you.MS. HELLER: - I don't have it right now. But economic growth is one of your heartfelt, really, almost concerns that it's almost - seems to me you're saying it's almost not even very valued the way it might have once been. You seem to try to make a point economic growth is a good thing.MR. KUDLOW: Yes.MS. HELLER: It's good for individuals.MR. KUDLOW: Yes.MS. HELLER: It's good for the country.MR. KUDLOW: Yes.MS. HELLER: Do you think that's -MR. KUDLOW: Makes people happy.MS. HELLER: - do you think that's not - just as a given is it becoming - I mean, do you think the Democrats would agree? Do they care as much as you do?MR. KUDLOW: Well, let me go back. I mean, part of my book about JFK and the Reagan Revolution, we know that Reagan was a supply-side tax cutter. He lowered marginal tax rates. He did so in two tranches - 1981 and the big one was '86. Both, I might add, were largely bipartisan. The '86 bill was completely bipartisan. OK.What you don't know or what many people don't recall is that the original pioneer supply-side tax cutter was John F. Kennedy, and to quote my friend, Art Laffer - my friend and mentor, Art Laffer, I am a former Democrat - I'm a Kennedy - I'm a JFK Democrat and a Reagan Republican because they were growth guys. A rising tide lifts all boats, and under their administration and later, we had terrific growth during the '60s and the '80s and the '90s. And by the way, I'm going to sneak Bill Clinton working with the Republican Congress. I thought he had some supply-side measures, particularly lowering the capital gains, even in the first term as he raised the income tax.So growth is very important. Growth is a job creator. Growth is a wage-increaser. Growth helps solve poverty. Growth helps lower budget deficits and long-term debt problems. Doesn't solve everything. There are structural issues. But growth is huge, and I don't think - I think Republicans are more in the growth path but the reason I say I think is that not necessarily to my satisfaction.MS. HELLER: Everyone's got to get more on the growth train -MR. KUDLOW: Right. Thank you.MS. HELLER: - right? For you?MR. KUDLOW: I think the tragedy in this story - and I don't mean to disrespect anybody - I'm sure there are a number of prominent Democrats in this group - but the tragedy of this story is that the Democratic Party in its officialdom is not promoting growth. It's, allegedly, trying to solve issues with inequality, redistribution, tax fairness, tax the rich people, tax rich corporations, tax capital gains. That's coming out in Ms. Clinton's campaign.And I think that's just dead wrong. I mean, we've had a period - and I don't want to go on forever on this - but in the last 16 years under Republicans and Democrats, presidents and Congresses, we've had less than 2 percent growth per annum and that is so far below America's long-run history - history. If you go back to the end of World War II or, you know, when the data got reasonably good in '48 or '49, to the year 2000, we grew at 3.5 percent per year and we had whatever - correct me if I'm wrong - 10 or 11 recessions and subsequent recoveries.I mean, in real terms, average wages went from about 16,000 (dollars) to 50,000 (dollars). We did great. Since 2000, on the other hand, basically real middle-income wages have not moved. The economy has slumped below 2 percent per year. Jobs are underperforming. Business investment has hardly moved. And those are issues that go right to productivity and the standards of living for individual American families. This is wrong.And I will go further on this. It's now an economic issue. I mean, the very beginning of our book, ""JFK and the and the Reagan Revolution,"" and the intro that I wrote, Americans are not happy campers. You know, there are lot of reasons for that. I'm not a sociologist. I'm not a psychiatrist. I have had group therapy but that doesn't make me an expert. That was a joke. That was a joke. (Laughter.) Just to lighten up a little bit here.My friend Arthur Brooks, who is the president of the American Enterprise Institute, and a very distinguished sociology scholar, as well as just being a clever chap, he's done a lot of work, as have others, down through the years that shows people are happier - happiness - you can actually measure happiness. Maybe not to your satisfaction, but he's done a lot of work on this. People are happier when we have high growth rather than low growth. People are happier when they earn their income from a job, a private job. And they are less happy when they receive government assistance.Now, these are generalities, and I'm not against the safety net. I'm just remarking. This is Arthur Brooks' work. The point I make in the intro to ""JFK and the Reagan Revolution,"" is that we are in a period where people are not happy, they are cranky, they are pessimistic, they are pointing the fingers are various people, groups - immigrants, you name it. And blame - the blame game is rampant. And unfortunately, in - to my way of thinking a perfectly dreadful presidential election going on right now - this has all come out. This has all come out.And I'm a Reagan guy. As I said, I'm a - I want growth, I want happiness, I want optimism. That's what I want. And I believe that evidence shows - and not everyone's going to agree with that - but I believe two of the key factors for promoting economic growth and all the good that goes with that is, number one, the lowest possible margin tax rates, which generate incentives to work, save, invest and take risks. And number two, a sound dollar - a stable, reliable, sound dollar.And I want to just cite my former boss and still sometimes intellectual mentor, Mr. Volcker gave a brilliant speech to the Bretton Woods Committee. I believe, Paul, it was late 2014, correct me if I'm wrong. Many of us read this speech. He basically said: We need to go back to a rules-based monetary policy. And we need to go back to international currency cooperation. And I would simply tag onto that, lowest possible tax rate with the least deductions and complexities - I hate complexities. And you can add regulations to that and a lot of other things, but that's the heart of it.To be short and overgeneralize, as I love to do, I call it tax cuts and king dollar. And when that worked, when that worked in the '60s, the '80s, the '90s, it really worked. When it was broken down, that model broke in the '70s, in the 2000s, and continues. So that's what I'm saying. And the guy who originated that was not a Republican, was not Ronald Reagan, was not Arthur Laffer, was not Larry Kudlow. It was John F. Kennedy. And there's no reason why the Democratic Party, which is moving way to the left, cannot come back and think about JFK's legacy. There's no reason for that.MS. HELLER: I mean, that's your point, Democrats can be supply-sider's too, right?MR. KUDLOW: You betcha. You betcha. And I just want to add to that, what we need now - Barney Frank made a very important point. He had many good insights with respect to Paul Ryan and so forth, and his political situation. Ryan may be a guy who is willing to put legislation on the floor that might have been blocked in the past for partisan reasons. I happen to agree with that. The JFK tax cuts and the Reagan tax cuts were bipartisan tax cuts. And I think what this nation needs to get a rising tide that lifts all boats is bipartisan, pro-growth tax reform. That's what we need. I'm not seeing it, much to my regret.MS. HELLER: What do you think three weeks from now - is there any chance of that happening, whichever candidate comes to win?MR. KUDLOW: You know, I'm a perpetual optimist, OK? I'm not crazy about this election. But, yes, there's always a chance. There's always a chance. We are, I think, perilously close to another recession, unfortunately. In fact, one would argue the whole business sector is in a recession. Production, business investment, productivity, profits are all falling. We're only growing at 1, 2 percent. So perhaps people can reason and develop something. And this leads me to my very last point this afternoon. I thank you for your patience.I have become a - not have become - but I believe one of the things that United States needs besides king dollar and tax cuts is civility - civility. Our discourse must improve. And I think that the art of persuasion, politely, has been lost. I think JFK and Reagan were very good at that. I thought Bill Clinton could be very good at that. I don't like insults. I don't like underhanded this and that, name calling. I don't like any of that. This is about principles, not personalities. I thought Reagan was real good at that. I thought JFK, who really had to convert the Democratic Party, and I think Bill Clinton at his best was very good at that. I'm asking you for civility. Our disagreements aside, there are some things that will work and we should talk about them.And I just want to add finally, I don't know if he's left or not, my friend Barney Frank, I've debated many times on CNBC. We went up to Nantucket and had a wonderful debate this past summer. We disagree on many things. We do agree on some things. But we are civil. That's all I ask.MR.: So we had promised to extend this group therapy session to the audience. (Laughter.) So before we wrap up, I wanted to see if we have any questions from anybody out there, and if so please raise your hand right away.If not, Larry, actually, let me throw a quick question at you, because I know you can't speak for the guy around the corner in Trump Tower. But just to throw a similar question at you that Dave threw at Congressman Frank. Who would you expect to see, or like to see, in financial regulatory areas in a Trump administration?MR. KUDLOW: I don't want to go there. That's just way too hard.MR.: Who would be your - or who do you consider to be sort of leading Republican lights on some of these issues?MR. KUDLOW: Oh, well, gee, the party's got a bunch of smart people. I hate to name names. It puts me on a difficult position.MS. HELLER: We're all just together here. It's OK.MR. KUDLOW: Kudlow says this. I'm a big fan of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who I think is a young man with tremendous financial ability. I've been pushing him for many years. On the more academic side, I'm a big fan of John Taylor, who has been a Council member, he's been undersecretary of the Treasury, he's an astute monetary analyst. There are a number of businessmen, and they're on Mr. Trump's committee. I just don't want to get into that. I cannot speak for the campaign, as you may know. I'm an informal advisor. I helped write his economic and tax cut plan, which if I do say so myself I thought was pretty darn good. (Laughter.) I just wish he'd use it. (Laughter.)MR.: All right. Well, thank you very much.",10/18/16
The Republican Convention: Ivanka Trump Set for Tough Role --- Nominee's daughter is expected to use convention speech to help win over women,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805709559?accountid=12768,"Presidential nominee Donald Trump handed his daughter Ivanka one of the most visible -- and toughest -- jobs at this week's Republican National Convention.When Ms. Trump introduces her father before his prime-time speechon Thursday, her goal isn't only to show he is a warm family man but also to assert that he is a friend of women.Trump campaign advisers expect the 34-year-old Ms. Trump, a senior executive in the Trump real-estate empire and founder of her own fashion line, to provide the American public ""living proof"" her father believes women can and should do everything men do.Mr. Trump needs his daughter's help to make headway with women -- the largest voter bloc and one with which he has dismal ratings -- as he begins a general election campaign against the first female presidential nominee for either national party.Democratic presidential presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton leads Mr. Trump by 15 percentage points among women, a recent Street Journal/NBC News poll found. Mrs. Clinton had support from 52% of women in July, compared with 37% for Mr. Trump.In the same Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, he trails Mrs. Clinton by 7 percentage points among women age 50 and older, but by a whopping 25 points among women 18-49 years old.Ms. Trump is facing ""a challenging task but also an opportunity,"" says Nick LaLota, a New York delegate from Suffolk County. One potential problem: Ms. Trump avoids touching political issues that Republicans crave. Unlike her brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who comfortably take on issues like gun rights and immigration, Ms. Trump never speaks as a political surrogate, only as a daughter and business colleague.Ms. Trump won't persuade those GOP women that will vote mainly on issues, one Republican strategist said. Still, she will be able to show how she thrived in the tough real-estate business her father created, said David DiPietro, New York assemblyman and convention delegate.Ms. Trump, considered the ""first among equals"" of Mr. Trump's five children, is often put in the spotlight. At rallies where her father can be brash and confrontational, she softens his edges with her poise and stories of his encouragement as a father and mentor.At the same time, Ms. Trump is very keen at reading him. For example, after Mr. Trump's devastating Ohio primary loss, she wanted to give him a boost by introducing him at his next rally in New York, even though it meant appearing just six days after giving birth to her third child.Mr. Trump values his daughter's opinions, even though she is a political novice with many liberal friends and fashion colleagues. She couldn't vote for her father in the closed New York Republican primary, because she is registered as an independent.An early suggestion by Ms. Trump to her father that he offer some support for Planned Parenthood -- with the exception of its abortion services -- reflected Democratic leanings and caused flak in the Republican primaries. However, that position could be useful going into the general election now that Mr. Trump needs to attract Democratic and independent voters.Credit: By Monica Langley",10/18/16
"The Republican Convention: Trump, Allies Step Up Fundraising Efforts",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805706705?accountid=12768,"Republican nominee Donald Trump and his allies are using this week's convention to escalate their fundraising efforts, holding meetings with major donors and readying to deploy Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Mr. Trump's newly announced running mate, to help bolster their coffers.Mr. Pence this week has met with some top fundraisers for Mr. Trump's joint fund with the Republican National Committee, as they begin scheduling events for the running mate to headline around the country.Donors who had given at least $100,000 to the RNC or to its joint fund with Mr. Trump gathered at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on Wednesday evening, as they waited for Mr. Pence to address the convention.

Pence and Trump are set to address hundreds of donors at a lunch Thursday.Meanwhile, in a sign that billionaire Sheldon Adelson may be getting closer to opening his wallet for Mr. Trump, the casino owner also met with Mr. Pence on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Mr. Adelson has said he might spend around $100 million on Mr. Trump's behalf, but recent Federal Election Commission records show he hasn't yet donated to the joint Trump-RNC fund, called Trump Victory.A spokesman for Mr. Adelson didn't return a request for comment on the meeting.A pro-Trump super PAC called Rebuilding America Now is also planning to deploy Mr. Pence to raise money. About 30 donors attended a fundraiser for the group Wednesday, during which Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort told attendees the campaign was ""grateful"" for the group's efforts, according to Alex Castellanos, an official at the super PAC.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",10/18/16
The Republican Convetion: Trump Divides GOP in Key Ohio County,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805706700?accountid=12768,"DELAWARE, OHIO -- The Republican Party headquarters in Ohio's Delaware County was missing some key signage in its window last week: anything showing support for Donald Trump.There were signs for Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and for other local candidates, but nothing visible for Mr. Trump, who officially became the Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday. The Trump signs were purposely in the back of the office, out of view, the staff said.Sara Marie Brenner, Delaware County chairwoman for the Trump campaign, wasn't surprised.""The only reason they have any signs at all is I dropped a few hundred off there,"" she said in a sarcastic tone.The spat over political signs at the party headquarters signals the deeper divisions among the Republicans here who could determine the outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election.The Republican National Committee chose Cleveland in August 2014 to host its presidential nominating party to maximize the exposure of its then-unknown nominee to voters in Ohio. It was a choice driven by history as much as the future: No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio.The location of Mr. Trump's official nomination is calling attention to the challenges he faces in November -- from overcoming OhioGov. John Kasich's opposition to his former GOP primary rival to winning a state where his key messages resonate in some areas and repel in others. Mr. Kasich won the state's GOP primary in March.A bit of good news for the nominee is that he starts the general election against Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in a dead heat here. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll last week showed them tied with Ohio registered voters at 39%.For Mr. Trump to prevail in Ohio this fall, he must win big in places like Delaware County, an affluent, growing Columbus suburb of 193,000, where Republicans outnumber Democrats more than 3 to 1. But Mr. Trump's success is far from assured.County Republicans, many of whom consider themselves moderates, gave Mr. Trump 22% of their vote in the primary. Mr. Trump's signature issues don't resonate in a place where immigrants are prized as nannies and construction workers, and where international trade plays almost no role in the county's economic success.The New York businessman's troubles in Delaware County reflect a broader problem: His tough rhetoric on trade and his history of controversy over race and religion turn off many traditional Republicans.Holly Quaine, president of the Delaware Area Chamber of Commerce, said she is wrestling with the choice and may decide not to pull the presidential lever at all.""The inertia in Delaware County is to vote Republican,"" she said. ""But with Trump, you have to stop and think. He's Donald Trump -- Kardashians, reality TV.""Politically, the area's establishment leanings can be seen in its loyalty to Mr. Kasich, who represented Delaware County and other parts of metropolitan Columbus when he was in the House. Mr. Kasich won 64% of the county vote in the primary.Mr. Kasich has criticized Mr. Trump for running a ""divisive campaign"" and creating what he called a ""toxic atmosphere."" The governor hasn't endorsed Mr. Trump, and he doesn't have a speaking slot at the convention.Mr. Trump's message is primarily targeted at workers who have gotten a raw deal in the global economy, an appeal that has helped him make important inroads to working-class voters.""Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache,"" he said at a rally in late June.But many Republican strongholds consist of the financial elite. The median household income in Delaware County, for instance, is $91,000, about $40,000 above the national average, and 51% of the 25-and-older population has at least a bachelor's degree, 20 points above the national average.During the 2016 primary campaign, Mr. Trump didn't do particularly well in urban centers that are prospering economically.(See related article: ""Candidate Faces Challenge Surpassing Romney"" -- WSJ July 21, 2016)Credit: By Dante Chinni and Bob Davis",10/18/16
"Trump's Personal Crucible: His Tumultuous 1990s --- 'Terrible, horrible' stretch helped forge traits that propelled the businessman to the nomination",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805706630?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's real-estate empire was on the brink of crumbling under $3.4 billion in debt. His soon-to-be-ex-wife Ivana was demanding $10 million. Walking down Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, he saw a blind man with a paper cup and realized the beggar's net worth was hundreds of millions more than his.Those trying times of the early 1990s would turn out to be Mr. Trump's personal crucible. He survived, and he said the searing experience helped forge the characteristics that propelled him to the Republican presidential nomination he will accept Thursday night.He learned, he said, to create an enduring public image of success in the face of failure, to trust his instincts and to get even. ""You have to do what you have to do,"" Mr. Trump said, in an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal, about his hardball tactics then and now. ""You have to play weak spots.""""I had some banks that I was negotiating with that were fabulous people,"" he said. ""I also had some very terrible people that I was dealing with, and had I not been more terrible than them, I might not be sitting here talking to you right now.""Mr. Trump averted personal bankruptcy and rebuilt his fortune by figuring out that instead of overleveraging real estate, he could leverage his brand. Years before he put his name on campaign T-shirts and staged news conferences at his golf courses, he mined the value of stamping ""Trump"" on everything he owned, tying his surname to affluence.He lost some prized assets, and his shoot-from-the-hip style and penchant for litigation soured relationships. But he emerged as the Donald Trump who knew better than ever how to launch withering personal attacks on foes and take charge of his own image.Mr. Trump said the publicity surrounding his financial travails and his divorce took a toll on his eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. Still, they have emerged as among his closest campaign advisers. ""I think it made my children tougher,"" he said. ""I think it also taught them to stick together.""In his book ""The Art of the Comeback,"" he called that time his ""most brilliant period"" because he performed under so much pressure.This week, as the party formally nominated Mr. Trump at the Republican convention in Cleveland, he took his place as the GOP standard bearer.Decades before he put his name into politics, Mr. Trump faced the first big test of his brand in Trump Tower, the 68-story Fifth Avenue development. Completed in 1983 soon after New York surfaced from a fiscal crisis, it was a success. ""If there was a Trump building on the north corner and a non-Trump building on the south corner,"" said Louise Sunshine, a marketing expert who worked for Mr. Trump at the time, ""we were going to prove that the Trump building was worth $1,000-a-square-foot more.""His success at creating a luxury brand stemmed from building his own celebrity as much as Trump Tower's fine marble. With Ivana, a former model, by his side, he flaunted his flashy lifestyle and surrounded himself with the rich and famous.Soon, his name emblazoned most of his investments, including the Trump Shuttle and Atlantic City casinos such as the Trump Taj Mahal. ""He borrowed like a sailor, loaded them up with too much debt, spent too much money,"" said Ben Berzin, Jr., who headed the workout division for Midlantic Bank, which lent Mr. Trump about $100 million by 1990.Mr. Trump acknowledged his business was ""overleveraged"" but blamed falling property values for his financial woes. By then, the U.S. economy was in a tailspin and Mr. Trump couldn't make debt payments.""That was a terrible, horrible period,"" Mr. Trump said. ""All of a sudden you're in this position, when the world is falling around you, and it could take you down.""He was saved, in part, by his brand. Creditors restructured his debts over five years, partly because they recognized his property was worth more if the Trump name wasn't tarnished with personal bankruptcy. Wilbur Ross Jr., who represented bondholders for Trump Taj Mahal, which sought bankruptcy protection in 1991, saw the brand's value during one of his visits with Mr. Trump to the casino. ""It was sort of a rock star thing,"" he recalled. The adulation ""was much like the reception he is getting now.""Mr. Trump's star power, and the ""America First"" message that roused an angry electorate, helped him draw more votes than any other Republican primary candidate in history despite a string of inaccurate statements, shifting positions and policy-knowledge gaps.""He has created a remarkable personality who is bigger than life,"" said Jay Goldberg, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers in the 1990s. ""No matter how many darts they throw at him, he is able to survive.""In part, that is because Mr. Trump meets darts with bayonets. After stock analyst Marvin Roffman questioned the financial stability of the Taj Mahal in 1990, Mr. Trump threatened to sue. Mr. Roffman signed a written apology, then tried to retract it. He was fired that day. He sued and won $750,000 from his former employer and an undisclosed settlement with Mr. Trump. ""I was attacking his brand,"" said Mr. Roffman, now retired, ""and that's something Trump can't allow."" Mr. Trump said it was appropriate for him to strike back at critics, including Mr. Roffman.Mr. Trump has shown similar vindictiveness in 2016, attacking critics and long-vanquished opponents and banning some media outlets from events. He has brought a $10 million claim against former adviser Sam Nunberg, arguing he breached a confidentiality agreement.Mr. Nunberg said in court papers Mr. Trump is seeking revenge because he first backed former rival Ted Cruz and was mistakenly pegged as the source of reports about an affair between staffers. Mr. Nunberg declined to comment on the dispute. Mr. Trump's campaign called Mr. Nunberg's claims ""categorically false.""""If you attack him or say anything that's negative,"" Ms. Sunshine said, ""you can expect to get it back, double-barreled.""In the 1990s, while banks reconfigured his loans, Mr. Trump sold his jet and yacht and was limited to $450,000 a month for personal and household expenses. His marriage to Ivana fell apart after news of his affair with Marla Maples, whom he wed in 1993.Mr. Trump kept pressing bankers to reduce his debt, claiming he wasn't able to pay. In public, he kept up his ritzy image. The wedding to Ms. Maples was a star-studded affair. Bankers were stunned when they saw Ms. Maples flashing an engagement ring from jeweler Harry Winston ""that looked like a golf ball,"" said Alan Pomerantz, a lawyer at the time at Weil Gotshal & Manges who represented Citibank. ""We said, 'Donald where did you get the money for this ring?' "" he recalled. ""He said, 'I didn't pay for it. It's a loaner.' ""Mr. Trump, in the interview, said: ""As a celebrity when you would go out in those days, the Harry Winstons of the world would give you jewelry for the night. So maybe they're talking about that."" That marriage ended after six years in divorce.Mr. Trump didn't repay his personal debts to the bank group until 1995. But he proclaimed his comeback as early as 1992 to the media. That year, he told New Jersey gaming regulators his net worth was $437 million to $1.6 billion.His new business model: He could do deals without taking on more debt by selling his brand and marketing skills. It was a more conservative strategy that foreshadowed a bare-bones primary campaign relying more on free publicity than fundraising and staff. ""Having built a great name and a great reputation and a great brand I guess was good,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And I get very high ratings. . .That's a tremendous advantage. No politician ever had that.""Mr. Trump's licensing strategy made its debut in the mid-1990s when General Electric Pension Trust and Galbreath Co. put his stamp on the conversion of the old Gulf & Western Building in Manhattan into a hotel and residential tower.He followed this model with condominium and hotel projects and licensed his name to businesses including clothes, steaks and mattresses. Some, including the Trump University real-estate school, collapsed.In ""The Art of the Comeback,"" Mr. Trump described himself during this period as ""Ranting and raving, cajoling, always selling, and generally having to be either the nicest person in the world or one of the worst.""Abe Wallach, who worked as a senior aide to Mr. Trump for 12 years, recalls writing a speech for him to give pension-fund advisers. ""He gets up to the podium and says: 'My guy wrote a speech. You don't want to hear it. You want to hear about Marla and what we're up to,'"" a story reminiscent of Mr. Trump's freewheeling campaign addresses.Many of the banks that worked with him during the 1990s never gave him another loan. The burned bridges presaged the fights Mr. Trump would pick with the political establishment in the 2016 race.Mr. Trump, who said he was ""tough"" with the banks but didn't need their money, adopts the same attitude toward Republicans who haven't endorsed him. ""Who are they going to pick?"" Mr. Trump asked at a rally in Las Vegas in June. ""I beat everybody. I beat the hell out of them.""Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Peter Grant",10/18/16
GOP Split as Cruz Snubs Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1805706622?accountid=12768,"CLEVELAND -- Sen. Ted Cruz refused to endorse Donald Trump on Wednesday night, leaving delegates at the Republican National Convention shouting angrily, and laying bare the rift between traditional conservatives and the populist candidate.In a dramatic prime-time address the day after Mr. Trump officially won the nomination, the Texas senator congratulated Mr. Trump by name for the victory and then never mentioned him again, drawing boos as he concluded his speech.The episode laid bare fissures that have complicated the Trump campaign's efforts to broaden his appeal and unify the party behind him before entering what's expected to be a brutal general election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.It came after the collapse on Monday of the stop-Trump movement that had spent months trying to upend Mr. Trump's nomination. While Mr. Cruz never directly participated in or blessed that campaign, it was orchestrated at every stage by his supporters.Mr. Cruz's prime speaking spot was offered to him -- the longest time allotment of any of Mr. Trump's GOP rivals -- to try to defuse the intraparty fight. The dramatic refusal by Mr. Cruz to fulfill the Republican candidates' pledge to back the primary victor, a man who insulted his family and offended his conservative principles, is likely to propel Mr. Cruz's standing among many movement advocates.Mr. Trump, on Twitter, reacted to Mr. Cruz's snub by saying, ""wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage."" The nominee said he'd learned two hours earlier that the senator wasn't going to endorse him, ""but let him speak anyway.""The closest Mr. Cruz came to an endorsement was a bland exhortation to vote. ""Please, don't stay home in November,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.""The crowd roared. But as Mr. Cruz wound down his speech and it became clear there was no forthcoming Trump endorsement, many in the crowd started chanting, ""Trump, Trump, Trump!"" Others started booing the Texan. Entire sections shook their heads in disappointment.Mr. Trump created his own distraction toward the end of Mr. Cruz's speech. Knowing Mr. Cruz had no plans to back him, he stepped into view, drawing the sights of cameras across the arena, as the Texan concluded his remarks.""Sore loser,"" Joe Mathis, a 68-year-old delegate from Alaska said of Mr. Cruz, as he leaned over to the woman seated next to him. ""Ted Cruz had a chance to bring the party together,"" he said. ""It's a shame. It didn't help the party.""Mr. Cruz's speech brought furious criticism from some of Mr. Trump's big supporters. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called it a ""betrayal"" on Facebook. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, on Twitter, said, ""tonight Ted Cruz demonstrated he is willing to place self before country.""New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, on ABC television, called the speech ""awful"" and ""selfish.""Former Florida Sen. George LeMieux, who backed Mr. Trump's defeated rivals Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio before endorsing Mr. Trump, said Mr. Cruz should have offered an endorsement.""It's amazing to me that Ted Cruz would come to Donald Trump's convention and be given the privilege of speaking and not endorse him,"" Mr. LeMieux said. ""He really hurt himself tonight with the grass roots.""Mr. Cruz's refusal to back Mr. Trump comes 10 weeks after the end of a bitter primary battle between the two, in which Mr. Trump christened him ""Lyin' Ted,"" mocked his wife's appearance and accused Mr. Cruz's father of having complicity in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Before he suspended his campaign in May, Mr. Cruz slammed Mr. Trump as a ""pathological liar."" Neither man has recanted their description of the other.While Mr. Trump's supporters have called for the GOP to unite behind him, Mr. Cruz told the convention hall that the onus is on Mr. Trump to do the uniting.""We deserve leaders who stand for principle,"" he said. ""Unite us all behind shared values. Cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect, from everybody.""Mr. Cruz's remarks marked the convention's most electric moment, calling for the Republican Party to adhere to his brand of conservative values -- an implicit criticism of Mr. Trump's populism.The Texas senator's rebuke of the party's nominee came after Mr. Trump's aides spent recent days hinting to reporters that they should expect Mr. Cruz to finally endorse Mr. Trump.Wednesday night's scene left the two men no closer to an endorsement, even though many of Mr. Cruz's supporters are now backing the nominee. Several delegates on the convention floor held signs that read ""Cruz delegate for Trump.""Matt Schultz, the former Iowa secretary of state who was the chairman of Mr. Cruz's Iowa campaign, said he is backing Mr. Trump and expects most of the Cruz coalition to do so, too, eventually.---Ben Kesling and Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Cruz, Honor, Unity and the Fragmented GOP"" -- WSJ July 25, 2016)Credit: By Reid J.

Trump Makes His Case --- GOP Hopes to Blaze New Trail to Victory,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806010034?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsJeff Roe was the campaign manager for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential bid. A Page One article Friday about Donald Trump's strategy for the fall election incorrectly said Mr. Roe was Mr. Cruz's pollster.(WSJ July 27, 2016)CLEVELAND -- Republican Donald Trump's fall campaign will test whether the most unconventional major-party presidential nominee in generations can cut an unconventional path to the White House.He aims to outmaneuver Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by capturing a handful of states in the Rust Belt and the Northeast that typically favor Democrats, with an appeal to less-educated, working-class voters.But the New York businessman leaves the convention here with the most negative public image of any nominee in modern history, particularly among minority voters, according to recent polls, and with many Republicans still hesitant to accept him as their standard bearer.Those headwinds to winning the 270 electoral votes needed to claim the presidency are particularly strong in some of the country's more racially and ethnically diverse swing states, polling shows, including Colorado and Virginia, where Mrs. Clinton leads.Her image, though, is nearly as tarnished as Mr. Trump's, and the convention here made it clear that Republicans want to make her the focus of the race. Most of the speakers dwelled on her perceived failings, often to chants of ""lock her up.""""In addition, the landscape could change drastically before Election Day, when the conventions will be a distant memory and Mr. Trump will have squared off with Mrs. Clinton in three fall debates. Republican George H.W. Bush, for example, surged past Michael Dukakis in the fall of 1988.Advisers to Mr. Trump point to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as states where he can outperform past GOP nominees, though the three states haven't voted Republican in a presidential race since at least 1988.His team is casting an even wider net, suggesting that Mr. Trump can compete in the solidly blue states of Connecticut, New Jersey and Oregon. ""I'm not saying we're going to win, but we're going to put them into play,"" said Donald Trump Jr., one of the candidate's sons, at a breakfast this week hosted by the The Wall Street Journal.From the campaign's outset, the Electoral College math has favored Democrats, with Mr. Trump needing to win 64 more electoral votes than Republican Mitt Romney won in 2012.Still, when the race began last year, the political environment seemed to be tipping in Republicans' favor. Voters were eager for change, and it had been more than a decade since the share of Americans who thought the country was on the right track outpaced those who thought it was on the wrong track.That hasn't changed, and yet Mrs. Clinton still leads nationally, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling throughout this year.The early polling doesn't paint a rosy scenario for Mr. Trump in traditional battlegrounds. Mrs. Clinton leads all seven states for which Real Clear Politics has aggregated polling. She also outpaced Mr. Trump in six of the seven states where the Journal, NBC News and Marist surveyed voters. That included Florida, the nation's largest swing state. The two were tied in Ohio, which is hosting the GOP convention.""This should be a very close race, with a slight edge to the Republicans,"" said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ""It's the first time we've had two candidates this disliked, but what matters is the difference between them -- he's more disliked than she is.""Overall, the 2016 White House race has revealed the same stark racial and educational divide that defined the electorate four years ago. Mrs. Clinton's leads among African-Americans and Hispanics resemble President Barack Obama's support in 2012, while Mr. Trump leads by 14 percentage points among whites. Mr. Romney won white voters by 20 percentage points in 2012, according to exit polls.Mr. Trump notched a sizable 55%-33% lead among white voters who don't have four-year college degrees, according to July's Journal/NBC News survey. But he essentially tied Mrs. Clinton in the poll among white voters who do have degrees. Republicans tend to run stronger with these voters. The split along lines of educational attainment is a big reason Mr. Trump is outpacing earlier GOP candidates in whiter, working-class communities, pollsters say, and why Mrs. Clinton is doing better in well-educated suburbs.""Trump has made the party more the party of the worker,"" said GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, who recently joined his campaign, at an event sponsored by the Atlantic.There are some bright spots for the Republican in many of the states Mr. Trump needs to win in November.Jeff Roe, the pollster for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, identified bellwether counties in seven battlegrounds that have correctly predicted the statewide outcome in each of the last four elections. Entering the convention, Mr. Trump had the lead in six -- in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mrs. Clinton posted her only advantage in Loudon County, Va.Mr. Trump spent far less than his Republican rivals to win the primary, and he may have to defy convention again to have a good shot at winning the general election, given the large sums that presidential candidates have spent to win.The Republican ended June with $20 million in the bank, according to Federal Election Commission data, after raising $26 million for his campaign and $32 million for the party. Mrs. Clinton ended the month with $44 million in the bank, having raised $40 million in June for her campaign and $81 million for the party.That financial advantage has translated into a big edge in television advertising. Since May 1, the Clinton campaign has spent more than $31 million on TV ads in nine states, according to Kantar Media. The Trump campaign hadn't spent a dime in that period.Given both candidates' uniquely negative images, operatives in both parties are already predicting historically low turnout, increasing the importance of party unity for both candidates. Mr. Trump may still have work to do after a nasty spat with GOP rival Mr. Cruz.""It does matter, if you don't have unity for a party coming out of a convention,"" said Chris Wilson, a pollster for Mr. Cruz, who was booed Wednesday night for refusing to endorse the nominee. ""That's a big problem we have.""Credit: By Patrick O'Connor",10/19/16
Trump Makes His Case --- Fiery Speech Targets Democratic Rival,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806009606?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump ended his party's convention Thursday the way he began his history-making campaign: attacking the political establishment, playing to voters' fears of foreigners and crime, and making bold promises to fix America's ills.""I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves,"" said the first-time politician whose populist message helped him capture the Republican presidential nomination.The speech, which ran more than an hour, painted a grim view of the U.S. economy and world affairs under President Barack Obama, and intensified the attack the record of his rival Hillary Clinton.""This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,"" he said.He returned to familiar campaign themes of opposing international trade deals and cracking down on illegal immigration. He drew strong applause when he reiterated his desire to ban immigrants from nations ""compromised by terrorism,"" and departed from his prepared text to say, ""We don't want them in our country.""He homed in on Mrs. Clinton, the one issue sure to galvanize Republicans in November. Arguing that her tenure as secretary of state under Mr. Obama fomented instability abroad, he said, ""America is far less safe -- and the world is far less stable -- than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy,"" he said. ""I am certain it is a decision President Barack Obama truly regrets.""Mr. Trump's speech was the capstone of a tumultuous convention that exposed some of the risks he faces as he takes his unorthodox campaign into a general election campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's well-funded and well-oiled machine.Mr. Trump presented himself as uniquely equipped to lead the nation.""Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,"" he said.Citing recent episodes of gun violence and attacks on police officers, he put fresh emphasis on law and order.""Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored,"" he said. ""The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threaten our communities.""Mr. Trump's message has been honed before oversize crowds on the primary campaign trail. It's less clear how it will play in a tough general election ahead with a broader audience of swing voters. Testing that was one of the chief convention goals, along with trying to unite the party and broaden Mr. Trump's personal profile.The stakes for Mr. Trump's speech rose in the wake of the missteps that marred the first days of the convention: the repeated passages in Melania Trump's speech from one delivered eight years earlier by Michelle Obama, a divisive fight over convention rules, and the chaos that erupted after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's refused to endorse Mr. Trump during a prime-time address Wednesday.""If you can't run a convention, how is he going to run a State Department, or the Pentagon?"" said Rick Tyler, former aide to the Cruz presidential campaign. ""The dominant message coming out of the convention is 'You may not like Donald Trump, but he is not Hillary Clinton.' If that's the dominant message, we've already lost.""Trump allies dismiss the long-term significance of the tumult surrounding Mr. Cruz's actions, saying the nominee may have been strengthened because of the backlash against the Texas senator. ""The person who shrinks after last night is Cruz not Trump,"" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who said the choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as Trump's running mate should help build bridges to disaffected conservatives.Gabriel N. Schwartz, a Trump supporter from Colorado, said he was confident that most Cruz dissidents are in the minority of the party and that Republicans will come around to vote Trump in November. ""What the convention doesn't do to unify the GOP, Hillary Clinton will,"""" he said.The Trump campaign used the GOP convention to showcase his family, which is considered one of his biggest assets -- and a potential antidote to one of his biggest political liabilities as he scores particularly low with women voters.The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that among suburban women, a key swing voting bloc, 66% say they would be pessimistic or uncertain if he were elected president; among independents, it is 73%.His wife, sons and daughters all tried to present a softer image of Mr. Trump. And the appearance of his eldest daughter on the final night was intended to signal to young women that the businessman wants everyone to succeed.In her introduction of her father, Ivanka Trump sought to counter suggestions that he is a sexist, saying that he believes in wage equality and that there are more female than male executives in his company. ""He hires the best person for the job. Period,"" said Ms. Trump.Yet the speeches by the Trump family offered only brief testimonials to their father's personal attributes before launching into themes that echoed his addresses at rallies.Mr. Trump has relied heavily on his family as advisers and surrogates; Mr. Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are Mr. Trump's most reliable outside advisers. But if their speeches are any indication, most of the party's heavy hitters are less inclined to make a robust case for Mr. Trump than they are to make the case against Mrs. Clinton.House Speaker Paul Ryan devoted more time to advancing his conservative vision for the party than to promoting Mr. Trump's virtues.

""Solidarity among allies is a key value for NATO.""Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Stoltenberg said alliance members ""defend one another.""Article 5 of the 1949 treaty that established NATO stipulates that an attack on one member represents an attack on all and requires the alliance to come to the defense of any country attacked.Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond Thursday to a request for comment.In an interview with the New York Times, Mr. Trump questioned the collective defense provisions of the NATO treaty on monetary grounds, saying that many members weren't paying their fair share. He told the newspaper that if Russia attacked the Baltic States, which are NATO members, he would decide whether to defend them only after reviewing ""if they have fulfilled their obligations to us.""Such a change in policy would put the alliance into question and fundamentally rewrite the rules of European security that have been in place since the end of World War II.Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond Thursday to a request for comment.The White House said that President Barack Obama has an ""ironclad"" commitment to NATO allies. ""There should be no mistake or miscalculation made about this country's commitment to our trans-Atlantic alliance,"" said Josh Earnest, Mr. Obama's spokesman.Mr. Trump's comments prompted an outcry from politicians and policy experts on both sides of the aisle, who warned that the U.S. couldn't go back on its word.""Statements like these make the world more dangerous and the U.S. less safe,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said in a statement, adding they would make Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a very happy man.""Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), a critic of Mr. Trump, said the U.S. stands with its allies in NATO. ""Our friends should draw strength and our adversaries should take pause from this simple fact: Americans keep our word,"" he said.At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, some lawmakers who said they plan to vote for Mr. Trump criticized his comments on NATO, including Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.).""I wholeheartedly reject that,"" he said. ""We have a treaty, we have an obligation.""A senior policy adviser to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said Mr. Trump's comments on NATO show he is ""temperamentally unfit and fundamentally ill-prepared to be our commander-in-chief.""---Julian E.

Disputed Bench Reappears in Trump Lobby,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806008276?accountid=12768,"Donald J. Trump's bench is back in the public lobby at Trump Tower.The bench has long been a point of friction between Mr. Trump and the government in New York City.Mr. Trump faced an aggravated-building-code violation and $10,000 fine for removing the bench without permission from a public space in the 58-story Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue at East 56th Street.But in the past few weeks, while Mr. Trump prepared for the Republican National Convention, workers bolted four 6-foot metal benches side-by-side in a marble floor of the Trump Tower lobby.""It is not too bad, but not too comfortable,"" said Gisela Skrzypnik, a dentist from Berlin visiting New York, as she sat with a friend on one of the metal benches on Thursday. ""It is like a bench you would sit on waiting for a train.""Michael Cohen, special counsel to Mr. Trump, said in an email that he was at the Republican convention and wasn't immediately available to comment on the bench. In the past he has said the building was in ""full compliance"" with all applicable statutes.The metal benches replace a 22-foot stone bench that was installed when the building opened in the early 1980s but was later removed.The original bench was required under a deal between the city and Mr. Trump in which he agreed to create a 6,626-square-foot public space, in the lobby and lower level, in exchange for the right to put up a bigger building.The new bench replaced a 40-foot-long sales counter that sold Trump-branded merchandise, and more recently accepted campaign contributions and sold hats with Mr. Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""In February, a hearing officer found that the sales counter, and a second one across the lobby, violated terms of Mr. Trump's agreement with the city, and fined his company, Trump Tower Commercial LLC, $4,000.When the counters weren't quickly removed, a building inspector issued a second violation. In June, Mr. Trump's staff told the city that the violation was fixed, but an inspector found that the sales counters had been removed and the bench not replaced.The dispute over the bench goes back years. In 1984, soon after the building opened, plants were placed on the stone bench, blocking it from use as a sitting space. When the city planning commission asked about the space, Mr. Trump said the bench was used in large numbers by ""drug addicts, vagrants, etc.""Credit: By Josh Barbanel",10/19/16
Trump-Branded Project Developer in Austin Seeks to Tap Immigrant Visa Program; EB-5 program grants U.S. green cards to foreigners in exchange for investment in U.S. businesses,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1830199882?accountid=12768,"The Trump Organization is partnering with a developer on a Texas hotel project that seeks to tap a controversial program granting green cards to foreigners who invest in the U.S.The federal EB-5 program gives up to 10,000 green cards a year to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in U.S. businesses deemed to create at least 10 American jobs per investor.The Republican presidential nominee's company is lending the Trump name to the 33-story luxury hotel and condominium development in downtown Austin, while its partner, Global Management Resources, would take charge of the construction, according to marketing materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The developer is marketing the project in China, according to the materials.Donald Trump has made tighter immigration control a pillar of his presidential campaign. He has also criticized China's trade and financial policies, blaming them for economic woes at home.""Our growth strategy is to expand the Trump Hotels portfolio by strategically opening properties in key U.S. and international locations,"" said a representative for Trump Hotels, part of the Trump Organization.The representative said the company hasn't invested its own capital in the Austin project, but remains interested in the market from a brand and management standpoint.Global Management executives didn't respond to a request for comment.The EB-5 program was created in 1990, and for much of its history was used by only a few hundred investors a year. But since 2008, real-estate developers have flocked to it as a form of low-cost loans for projects. Because many foreign investors are motivated primarily by the prospect of a green card--not the financial investment--they tend to accept below-market interest rates, meaning big savings for developers. A large majority of those investors in recent years have hailed from China, typically accounting for more than 80% of EB-5 visas.At least $8.7 billion has been invested in the U.S. economy through the program since Oct. 1, 2012, and an estimated 35,140 jobs have been created for U.S. workers through foreign investment via EB-5, according to the Immigrant Investor Program Office at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.While some in Congress have criticized the program's premise--giving green cards to wealthy investors--other issues also have cast a cloud over the program in recent years. Some developers and middlemen who have raised money through the program have been alleged to be involved in fraudulent schemes.The program also has become dominated by developers of projects in wealthy neighborhoods who are using a provision meant to aid economically ailing ones.A study released Wednesday by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that just 12% of investment went to projects located in a census tract with an unemployment rate of at least 8%, even though those projects benefited from a provision earmarked for high-unemployment areas. A large chunk--36%--was for projects in a tract with an unemployment rate of 4% or lower.The program is due to expire in December, and lawmakers are clashing over proposed changes.The entity pooling the EB-5 money for the $170 million Trump-branded hotel, Renewable Texas Energy Regional Center LLC, is seeking $40 million from 80 EB-5 investors. The center estimated the project will create 1,427 direct and indirect jobs.The hotel will have 255 rooms and 22 condominium units and an outdoor rooftop terrace. It is a five-minute walk to Austin's 6th Street entertainment district. Trump Hotels will manage the property, according to documents on the center's website.While Mr. Trump has run for president, his company has continued to find new business opportunities around the world. In recent years, most of Mr. Trump's real-estate deals have been branding agreements in which he has licensed his name to others but hasn't taken any of the financial risk.Exceptions include the Trump International Hotel, which opened recently in a converted Post Office building in Washington, D.C.Another Trump-branded project has applied for EB-5 funding: an apartment tower in Jersey City, N.J., being developed by Kushner Cos. and KABR Group. The chief executive of Kushner is Jared Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump's daughter, Ivanka.Josh Chin and Eliot Brown contributed to this article.Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com and Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.comRelated* EB-5 Program Benefits Rich Neighborhoods More, Study Shows* Senators Say EB-5 Visas Should Be Fixed--or Deep-SixedCredit: By Esther Fung and Peter Grant",10/20/16

Should Christians Vote for Trump?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1828136461?accountid=12768,"This question should hardly require an essay, but let's face it: We're living in strange times. America is in trouble.Over this past year many of Donald Trump's comments have made me almost literally hopping mad. The hot-mic comments from 2005 are especially horrifying. Can there be any question we should denounce them with flailing arms and screeching volume? I must not hang out in the right locker rooms, because if anyone I know said such things I might assault him physically (and repent later). So yes, many see these comments as a deal breaker.But we have a very knotty and larger problem. What if the other candidate also has deal breakers? Even a whole deplorable basketful? Suddenly things become horribly awkward. Would God want me simply not to vote? Is that a serious option?What if not pulling the lever for Mr. Trump effectively means electing someone who has actively enabled sexual predation in her husband before -- and while -- he was president? Won't God hold me responsible for that? What if she defended a man who raped a 12-year-old and in recalling the case laughed about getting away with it? Will I be excused from letting this person become president? What if she used her position as secretary of state to funnel hundreds of millions into her own foundation, much of it from nations that treat women and gay people worse than dogs? Since these things are true, can I escape responsibility for them by simply not voting?Many say they won't vote because choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil. But this is sophistry. Neither candidate is pure evil. They are human beings. We cannot escape the uncomfortable obligation to soberly choose between them. Not voting -- or voting for a third candidate who cannot win -- is a rationalization designed more than anything to assuage our consciences. Yet people in America and abroad depend on voters to make this very difficult choice.Children in the Middle East are forced to watch their fathers drowned in cages by ISIS. Kids in inner-city America are condemned to lives of poverty, hopelessness and increasing violence. Shall we sit on our hands and simply trust ""the least of these"" to God, as though that were our only option? Don't we have an obligation to them?Two heroes about whom I've written faced similar difficulties. William Wilberforce, who ended the slave trade in the British Empire, often worked with other parliamentarians he knew to be vile and immoral in their personal lives.Why did he? First, because as a sincere Christian he knew he must extend grace and forgiveness to others, since he desperately needed them himself. Second, because he knew the main issue was not his moral purity, nor the moral impurity of his colleagues, but rather the injustices and horrors suffered by the African slaves whose cause he championed. He knew that before God his first obligation was to them, and he must do what he could to help them.The anti-Nazi martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer also did things most Christians of his day were disgusted by. He most infamously joined a plot to kill the head of his government. He was horrified by it, but he did it nonetheless because he knew that to stay ""morally pure"" would allow the murder of millions to continue. Doing nothing or merely ""praying"" was not an option. He understood that God was merciful, and that even if his actions were wrong, God saw his heart and could forgive him. But he knew he must act.Wilberforce and Bonhoeffer knew it was an audience of One to whom they would ultimately answer. And He asks, ""What did you do to the least of these?""It's a fact that if Hillary Clinton is elected, the country's chance to have a Supreme Court that values the Constitution -- and the genuine liberty and self-government for which millions have died -- is gone. Not for four years, or eight, but forever. Many say Mr. Trump can't be trusted to deliver on this score, but Mrs. Clinton certainly can be trusted in the opposite direction. For our kids and grandkids, are we not obliged to take our best shot at this? Shall we sit on our hands and refuse to choose?If imperiously flouting the rules by having a private server endangered American lives and secrets and may lead to more deaths, if she cynically deleted thousands of emails, and if her foreign-policy judgment led to the rise of Islamic State, won't refusing to vote make me responsible for those suffering as a result of these things? How do I squirm out of this horrific conundrum? It's unavoidable: We who can vote must answer to God for these people, whom He loves. We are indeed our brothers' and sisters' keepers.We would be responsible for passively electing someone who champions the abomination of partial-birth abortion, someone who is celebrated by an organization that sells baby parts. We already live in a country where judges force bakers, florists and photographers to violate their consciences and faith -- and Mrs. Clinton has zealously ratified this. If we believe this ends with bakers and photographers, we are horribly mistaken. No matter your faith or lack of faith, this statist view of America will dramatically affect you and your children.For many of us, this is very painful, pulling the lever for someone many think odious. But please consider this: A vote for Donald Trump is not necessarily a vote for Donald Trump himself. It is a vote for those who will be affected by the results of this election. Not to vote is to vote. God will not hold us guiltless.---Mr. Metaxas, host of the nationally syndicated ""Eric Metaxas Show,"" is the author of ""If You Can Keep It: The Forgotten Promise of American Liberty"" (Viking, 2016).(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: People of Faith Facing Imperfect Candidates"" -- WSJ Oct. 21, 2016)Credit: By Eric Metaxas",10/20/16
U.S. News: Trump Aims to Rain on Clinton's Parade --- Republican will appear at town-hall meetings and vets event while Democrats convene,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806401067?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Donald Trump will try to steal some of Hillary Clinton's thunder during the Democratic National Convention here this week with a slate of swing-state appearances that will test the appeal of his new running mate.Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will join the GOP presidential nominee at stops in Virginia and North Carolina on Monday, Florida on Tuesday and Pennsylvania on Wednesday, according to a campaign schedule. Other GOP allies will hover around Philadelphia for counterprogramming during the Democratic gathering.The Republican nominees in their travels will jointly appear at two town hall meetings, a rally, a national veterans' convention and what the campaign described as a Hispanic leadership round table.The two men will then split up on the campaign trailas Mrs. Clinton takes the Philadelphia stage Thursday, aides to the New York businessman said. Mr. Pence will campaign with his wife, Karen.Mrs. Clinton last week eschewed the tradition of letting the opposing party have the national stage during its convention, and campaigned in Ohio while the Republican gathering took place there. Clinton surrogates also traveled to Cleveland to push back against the frequent attacks on Mrs. Clinton at the GOP event.Mr. Trump, in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC, underscored how far he is willing to limit immigration as an antiterrorism tool. He said immigrants from close allies such as France might be subject to the ""extreme vetting"" he proposes for those from nations he deems ""compromised by terrorism."" A Bastille Day terror attack in Nice, France, earlier this month killed 84 people.Mr. Trump was clarifying comments he made at the GOP convention that some interpreted as narrowing his past proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. He more recently described a ban that looks not at religion but at what he says are the failures of countries to combat terrorism inside their borders.""I actually don't think it's a rollback,"" Mr. Trump said. ""In fact, you could say it's an expansion. I'm looking now at territory.""In coming weeks, Mr. Trump told NBC, he would unveil a detailed list of countries and territories from which immigrants would be subject to ""extreme vetting.""Mr. Trump also threatened on NBC to pull the U.S. out of the World Trade Organization if membership in the global body interferes with his plan to impose penalties on companies that move U.S. production offshore.The WTO threat appeared to mark a new level of attack on the global trading system that evolved in the postwar era. Mr. Trump previously denigrated the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, and a proposed Pacific trade pact.In Philadelphia, national and state Republicanswere set to kick off their own messaging Sunday night, when Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort were on hand to talk to reporters.The Pennsylvania GOP, meantime, is set to hold news conferences Tuesday and Wednesday to push back against Democrats, and flood call-in radio shows Thursday, a party spokeswoman said.Republican attacks on Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic convention could help distract from lingering tensions within the GOP from Mr. Trump's spats with primary-season rivals who declined to endorse him: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who didn't attend the convention in his home state, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who gave a convention speech and was booed off the stage when he didn't endorse Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump indicated he doesn't plan to let the issue lie. He told NBC that he would back efforts to defeat Messrs. Cruz and Kasich and a third Republican whom he didn't name by generating funds to oppose them.Mr. Kasich won re-election to a four-year term in 2014, and since Ohio imposes a two-term limit on governorships, it isn't clear Mr. Trump will have an opportunity to back a Kasich challenger. Mr. Cruz was elected to a six-year Senate term in 2012.---William Mauldin contributed to this article.Credit: By Heather Haddon and Janet Hook",10/20/16
Information Age: Trump's Big Data Gamble,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806391736?accountid=12768,"Among Donald Trump's unorthodoxies is his campaign's refusal to use big data. ""I've always felt it was overrated,"" Mr. Trump said in May. ""Obama got the votes much more so than his data-processing machine. And I think the same is true with me.""David Plouffe, who ran Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, tweeted: ""Trump now wants to ban data and modeling from his campaign. Agree with him that Obama got the votes not data. But flying blind is nuts."" Democratic operative Ron Klain quipped in response: ""Plouffe: Ix-nay on the elping-hay of rump-tray.""They have reason to laugh. Campaign professionals in both parties agree the Democrats have a large lead in information about voters -- and that smart use of data can make the difference, at least in close elections. When she officially becomes the party's nominee this week, Hillary Clinton will inherit the database Mr. Obama's team built over two campaigns.In 2008 the Obama campaign gathered so much information that it was ""confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans"" who voted for him, according to journalist Sasha Issenberg. The 2012 campaign built a fully merged database Republicans have yet to match.""We are going to measure every single thing in this campaign,"" Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said in 2011. His team built a database connecting personal data from traditional sources, such as reports from field workers and pollsters, with voters' social-media posts and other online behavior, plus commercial consumer data of the sort that online retailers and credit agencies use.That allowed precise targeting of the most ""persuadable"" voters. ""We knew who these people were going to vote for before they decided,"" an Obama data scientist told Mr. Issenberg. Voters were hit with tailored messages. In one case, the campaign sent seven different customized email invitations to one fundraising dinner in New York.Mitt Romney's smaller data team started out behind and never caught up. After the Democrats' 2012 victory, they created the Project Legacy database, which Mrs. Clinton inherits this week. Now Mr. Trump, behind in data by two election cycles, doesn't think he needs to worry about the data he lacks -- a known unknown for his campaign.As a celebrity-politician, Mr. Trump uses social media brilliantly. By one estimate the free publicity he has drawn is the equivalent of $2 billion in advertising. But that's very different from how analytical marketers target and persuade prospects, whether for orange juice or presidential candidates.It may be pandering, but the Obama campaigns proved it works. Democrats are updating the existing database with voter profiles based on how they voted in local elections, which magazines they read, their bank balances and the health topics they search online. Republicans using the #NeverTrump hashtag should expect to be targeted by the Clinton campaign with custom messages on the virtues of voting Libertarian or staying home. Other messages will highlight Mr. Trump's negatives while minimizing Mrs. Clinton's.Reports say her hundreds of data scientists are working especially closely with Facebook to leverage each voter's social network. The campaign is testing which messages resonate best with each prospective voter. It will also use Facebook to remind Mrs. Clinton's supporters to urge like-minded friends and relatives to go to the polls.A Pew Research Center study last week uncovered a new way the Clinton campaign is using Facebook to gather more information about voters. It found that 80% of the links on the campaign's Facebook account link to pages on the campaign's website, where more user data can be captured. In contrast, 78% of the links on the Trump Facebook account take users to news articles on media sites, where his campaign has no ability to track users or mine their data.Campaign strategists say big data is especially valuable in close presidential races, in which some votes matter more than others. In 2012 Mr. Obama's data scientists ran more than 60,000 election simulations every night to figure out in which states to allocate resources, and which counties in those states were the most promising sources of votes.The Trump campaign might hope this is the year voters resent how their information is used to market to them. But consumers seem to have gotten used to being targeted by commercial marketers, so Mr. Trump probably can't count on outrage over Democrats' making smarter use of data.Mr. Trump may not like it, but data from past presidential elections finds an undeniable correlation: The candidate with the best data is the winner.Credit: By L.

Wharton Grad Trump Fails Economics,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806391576?accountid=12768,"Nationwide fear of the reckless and shady Hillary Clinton as the next U.S. commander in chief -- and at least a 12-year streak of Democrats in the White House -- means that a Republican presidential victory in November cannot be ruled out. But why, with a rival so highly unlikable, is GOP candidate Donald Trump unable to excite a wider number of voters?One glaring problem is that Mr. Trump, who has an undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, fails economics. Exhibit A is his promise to shred the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) on the grounds that Mexico, his favorite bete noire, is stealing American jobs. It is technology, not free trade, that is behind the shrinking number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.Beating Nafta like a pinata worked in the Republican primary. But it is likely to hurt Mr. Trump and GOP candidates further down the ticket in the general election. Mexico is, after all, the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner and second-largest export market.Mr. Trump's trade tirades undermine his credibility with voters who know better. And that's a lot of voters. Americans from every walk of life are beneficiaries of U.S. global trade.Indiana, the home of GOP vice-presidential candidate Gov. Mike Pence, exported some $4.8 billion of goods to Mexico in 2015, making it the state's second-largest export market. That included $1.5 billion in transportation equipment, $1.4 billion in machinery and $88 million in corn-fructose products. More than 120,000 Hoosier jobs depend on trade with Mexico.Exports to Mexico were over $1 billion in 31 states in 2015. It's the largest export market for California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. It ranks second for 25 other states.To hear the Trump campaign tell it, American workers who don't want to increase protectionism are coddled members of the ""elite."" Yet the majority of people employed in today's globally connected, tech-driven U.S. economy hail from middle-class families who made financial sacrifices to prepare them to compete in the modern workforce. It's dispiriting to hear the GOP nominee denigrate achievers and try to pit Americans against one another.Higher tariffs on U.S. imports will be passed on to American consumers, many of whom are already hurting economically due to the sluggish Obama recovery. Trade wars will also damage U.S. competitiveness. As former Mexican deputy trade minister Luis de la Calle explained in a conference call to investors in New York earlier this month, Carrier Corp.'s production move to Mexico from Indiana -- much-assailed by Mr. Trump -- means that the company can survive Asian competition and can retain U.S. jobs in research, development, marketing and high-end components.Perhaps the biggest lie that Mr. Trump peddles is that higher tariffs can restore lost U.S. manufacturing jobs. They won't, and to suggest otherwise is a cruel hoax.In a recent Foreign Affairs magazine essay titled ""The Truth About Trade,"" Dartmouth economist Douglas Irwin observes that while technology has ""enabled vast productivity and efficiency improvements,"" it has ""also made many blue-collar jobs obsolete."" Mr. Irwin cites a study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, which ""found that productivity growth accounted for more than 85 percent of the job loss in manufacturing between 2000 and 2010, a period when employment in that sector fell by 5.6 million."" This 85% compares, according to the study, with 13% of job losses attributed to trade during the same period. In other words, to bring most jobs back, Mr. Trump would have to outlaw mechanization. Will Mr. Pence break the news to Indiana farmers?In a paper published last summer in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, MIT economist David Autor unpacks the reason automation has hit the middle-class hard. He observes that in order to write code for a task, a programmer must be able to ""enunciate the explicit 'rules' or procedures"" necessary to do it. But tasks understood by humans ""tacitly"" are not easy to automate. Mr. Autor calls this constraint ""Polanyi's paradox"" after the Hungarian-born chemist and economist who observed that ""we know more than we can tell.""It is ""high-education"" and ""low-education"" jobs -- requiring ""interpersonal interaction, flexibility, adaptability and problem solving"" -- that are most difficult to automate Mr. Autor notes. Traditional middle-education jobs have been the easiest to replace with technology.Yet there is also strong evidence of adaptation in the middle of the pack. Mr. Autor cites a couple of economists who have identified evidence of new job creation for this group. The catch, he says, is that ""human capital investment must be at the heart of any long-term strategy for producing skills that are complemented by rather than substituted for by technological change.""Protectionism is populist demagoguery and will only impoverish the middle class. Many Americans see through Mr. Trump's false promises, which is one reason he's in a tight race despite Hillary's high negatives.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Trump, Trade, Technology and American Jobs"" -- WSJ Aug. 1, 2016)Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady",10/20/16
"Stephen Bollenbach Ran the Numbers for Hilton, Disney, Marriott and Trump; Executive rose from modest background and a job scooping ice cream",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1830699078?accountid=12768,"The son of a milkman, Steve Bollenbach didn't attend an elite college or learn to swagger on Wall Street. Yet his reputation for financial wizardry was so strong that his services were sought by the Marriott and Hilton families, Walt Disney Co. and Donald Trump.He revitalized Hilton Hotels, helped Disney acquire the ABC-television network and ESPN, split Marriott into two companies, and got Donald Trump out of a financial bind.Mr. Bollenbach died Oct. 8 at a New York hospital after what his wife termed a long illness. He was 74 years old.""He could take a very complex situation and boil it down into a very simple road map,"" said Matthew Hart, who worked with Mr. Bollenbach at several companies. He also was decisive and adept at figuring out what would please fickle investors at any given time.Though generally affable, his temper could be set off by such things as unreliable cellphone service or an investment banker who failed to return a call promptly. ""When Steve was not happy with you, I mean, the room shook,"" said Ken Moelis, an investment banking adviser and friend of Mr. Bollenbach. ""Smoke would be coming out."" Those eruptions quickly abated, though, and there were no hard feelings.Stephen Frasier Bollenbach was born July 14, 1942, in the Los Angeles area. As a teenager, he served ice cream at Disneyland. He earned a bachelor's degree in business at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a master's in business administration at California State University, Northridge.Before completing his schooling, he got a part-time job as a teller at a savings and loan. His boss there, John Notter, was struck by Mr. Bollenbach's precocious grasp of business. He was given a full-time job after graduation and followed Mr. Notter to another savings and loan, owned by Daniel K. Ludwig, a secretive billionaire with interests in shipping, real estate and a mammoth pulp project in Brazil that flopped. Messrs. Notter and Bollenbach helped steer Mr. Ludwig's financial affairs for more than a decade.In the 1980s, Mr. Bollenbach worked as the treasurer at Marriott Corp. and chief financial officer at Holiday Corp., which owned the Holiday Inn chain.Hired by the Trump Organization in 1990, Mr. Bollenbach drew up agreements calling for Mr. Trump to give up equity in casino, real estate and airline holdings in exchange for new terms on his debt and a release from $650 million in personal debt guarantees. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Trump said Tuesday Mr. Bollenbach had ""a brilliant financial mind.""Mr. Bollenbach returned to Marriott as chief financial officer in the early 1990s and found its stock price was weighed down because real-estate holdings were out of favor. His solution was to divide the company into two: Marriott International Inc., a high-growth hotel operator, and Host Marriott Corp., a debt-laden real-estate company. That led to downgrades of bonds and resulted in litigation, but Mr. Bollenbach, who became CEO of Host Marriott, prevailed in court.Mr. Bollenbach disliked making presentations to investors and often considered them a waste of time. As CEO of Host Marriott, the new real-estate company, he went on a roadshow to meet investors and made a stop at a financial firm in Philadelphia, where only a junior chemical analyst was available to hear the pitch.Afterward, an investment banker who had arranged the visit began apologizing. Mr. Bollenbach shushed him, and they returned to a limousine in silence. Mr. Bollenbach spotted a cheese-steak peddler and rolled down the window to ask whether he might want to buy any Host Marriott securities. The peddler was baffled. Mr. Bollenbach told the banker he had a better chance of selling securities to the cheese-steak vendor than the institution just visited.Disney recruited him in 1995 as chief financial officer under CEO Michael Eisner. Mr. Bollenbach helped persuade Mr. Eisner to pay $19 billion for Capital Cities/ABC Inc., the second-largest U.S. acquisition ever at that time. (""Without him, I would never have the courage to take on this much debt,"" Mr. Eisner said.) The Disney chief then hired the talent agent Michael Ovitz as president. That seemed to dilute Mr. Bollenbach's clout at Disney. Barron Hilton, son of the hotel company's founder, swooped in to hire Mr. Bollenbach as CEO of Hilton Hotels in 1996.When he arrived, Hilton had a strong brand but was ""just sort of plodding along,"" said Marc Grossman, who was a senior vice president at the hotel company. Within a week, Mr. Bollenbach presented a plan including purchases of casinos and hotels and wringing more value out of the Hilton brand. ""What we really had lacked was a clear, concise, achievable story and strategy, and here it was,"" Mr. Grossman said.Mr. Bollenbach bought the gambling company Bally Entertainment Corp. to give Hilton more scale in casinos, and later spun off the gaming operations. In 1997, Mr. Bollenbach tried to buy ITT Corp., owner of the Sheraton hotel brand, but he was outbid by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. The battle got ugly, and at one point Mr. Bollenbach called ITT's CEO, Rand Araskog, a ""weenie."" When Starwood prevailed, Mr. Bollenbach played down his disappointment. ""It's not as bad as when I stub my toe in the backyard,"" he said.He went on to make what colleagues say was a better deal, buying Promus Hotel Corp., giving Hilton a broader range of brands, including Hampton Inn. In 2007, Blackstone Group LP bought Hilton for $20 billion, and Mr. Bollenbach retired. He held board seats at companies including American International Group Inc. and Mondelez International Inc.In his spare time, Mr. Bollenbach drove sports cars including a Porsche 911 Turbo S and Ferrari Testarossa. He skied well, played golf poorly, collected wine and studied Civil War history. A family education fund he established provides scholarships.He is survived by his wife, Kimberly, whom he married in 2011, as well as two sons and two grandchildren from a previous marriage.Write to James R.

Senate Republicans Find Trump's Slide in Polls Buoys Democratic Challengers; GOP sees funding gap widen as opponents shift money to competitive states,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1830699054?accountid=12768,"Senate Republicans fighting to keep control of the chamber in the face of Donald Trump's dip in the presidential polls are facing a new hurdle: an influx of last-minute cash for their Democratic opponents.In the two weeks leading up to Election Day, Democratic outside groups are set to spend substantially more money on TV advertising than their Republican counterparts in eight of 10 key Senate races, sending Republicans scrambling to narrow the gap.The GOP holds a spending advantage only in Ohio and Florida, two states where Democrats have all but conceded losses to Republican incumbent Sens.

Yet those two prospective setbacks have cleared the way for pro-Democratic outside groups to shift their cash to other competitive races.In Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, ad reservations show Democrats have committed at least $1 million more than Republicans.In Pennsylvania, Democrats are set to spend $15 million from Oct. 17 through Election Day, compared with Republicans' $9 million, according to a media tracker. In New Hampshire, Democrats are investing $17 million compared with Republicans' $11 million.""There absolutely is a push to get some more money in, and I personally have made a bunch of calls in the last few days to try and make that happen,"" said Mel Immergut, a venture capitalist and a major GOP donor focused on several Senate races.The Democratic advantage is particularly notable in a year when Republican fundraisers, who typically focus their resources on presidential contests, have shied from Mr. Trump.

Mr. Law said he expects the groups' total spending this cycle will increase 50% over their 2014 spending totals.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is also working to re-elect a Republican Senate majority, made its investments early, spending $24 million on races, including primaries. The group is now set to spend about $1 million more in the campaign's final stretch, according to a person familiar with its plans.Freedom Partners, an organization aligned with conservative billionaires David and Charles Koch, announced in September that it was pulling all of its October advertising in favor of investing in on-the-ground field efforts.Republicans in the House appear to be grappling with the same dynamic.""As things currently stand, Republicans are going to be outspent by a wide margin in the final weeks of the campaign,"" National Republican Congressional Committee Executive Director Rob Sims wrote to House Republicans in an internal memo.""Energized donors and union allies have poured tens of millions of dollars into Democrat-aligned groups over the past several weeks and those resources are being deployed in over 30 districts across the country,"" he added.Still, Democrats caution that the current dynamic could quickly shift.The NRSC closed September with one of its best monthly fundraising hauls, raking in $15 million and taking out an additional $15 million loan.

A Lincoln Lesson for Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1830609299?accountid=12768,"A few weeks before one of the most consequential presidential elections in history, the Republican candidate struggled with the possibility that he would likely lose. He had no choice but to face the ultimate decision: whether or not to accept the verdict, whatever it might be.The answer was quite different in 1864 than in 2016, because the presidential nominee then wasn't Donald Trump, but Abraham Lincoln, whom Mr. Trump professes to admire.If anyone ever had a reason to reject the will of the voters, it was Lincoln in 1864, running for re-election against George B. McClellan. The presidential campaign was taking place in the midst of a civil war, with freedom of the press and speech under suspension by the president himself, using what he called his ""war powers"" to limit dissent that might discourage military enlistment. Half the country was in armed conflict with the other, and the casualties were already half a million souls. A state of emergency prevailed. Military tribunals had sprung up in border states to supplant the civil judicial system.Trying valiantly to quash rebellion, Lincoln might have agreed to cancel or postpone the election. Instead, he insisted that ""we cannot have free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forego, or postpone, a national election, it, might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us."" The U.S. became the first nation to hold a popular election during civil war.That didn't stop the bleeding -- either on the battlefield or in public opinion. Late in August, Lincoln concluded that it was ""exceedingly probable"" that he would lose. Knowing that a Democratic successor might let the South leave the Union and would almost certainly cancel the Emancipation Proclamation upon taking office, Lincoln did two extraordinary things.First, he invited the African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass to the White House. There, Lincoln assigned him to craft a plan to use the time between Election Day and Inauguration Day (then March 4) to send official liberators into the Deep South. There, they were to spread the word of emancipation to as many enslaved people as possible, guaranteeing their freedom ""then, thenceforward, and forever"" -- and before the opposition took the White House and stopped the process. Douglass drafted a blueprint for action, although the administration never had to deploy it.Then Lincoln prepared a concessionary memorandum of his own, signed sight-unseen by his cabinet, pledging not only ""to cooperate with the President elect,"" but ""to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards.""Whether the memo was legally binding, no one can be sure. But that it demonstrated that an all-powerful chief executive was willing to step down, cooperate and accept the will of the voters is indisputable. He wasn't too big to fall. Donald Trump has a great deal to learn from the man he called, in the second debate, ""the late, great Abraham Lincoln.""---Mr. Holzer, who won the 2015 Lincoln Prize, is director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College.Credit: By Harold Holzer",10/21/16

Trump's -- and FDR's -- 'Forgotten Man',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1806558703?accountid=12768,"""I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country.""-- Donald Trump, July 21, 2016This year's Republican presidential nominee is not the first politician to utter the phrase ""forgotten man."" The term has periodically surfaced since the late 19th century, when voters learned that the forgotten man opposed the Dingley Tariff. Yet it still resonates today. Two years ago Sarah Palin told the Western Conservative Summit that ""what the forgotten man has is belief in this exceptional nation.""But what do politicians mean by the forgotten man? Two opposing definitions predominate. Which of these Mr. Trump chooses will tell us the kind of president he might make.The forgotten man emerged in the 1880s in the lectures of a Yale professor named William Graham Sumner. A Thomas Piketty in reverse, Sumner abhorred efforts to equalize society and offered an elegant equation: ""As soon as A observes something which seems to him to be wrong, from which X is suffering, A talks it over with B, and A and B then propose to get a law passed to remedy the evil and help X. Their law always proposes to determine what C shall do for X or, in the better case, what A, B and C shall do for X.""""C"" is the forgotten man, declared Sumner, a kind of everyman who falls into no category: ""He works, he votes, generally he prays -- but he always pays -- yes, above all, he pays.""Sumner, a classical liberal, believed that strong commerce helped the poor better than the best government benefit. ""If you do anything for the Forgotten Man, you must secure him his earnings and savings, that is, you legislate for the security of capital and for its free employment,"" Sumner wrote.""Jobbery,"" as Sumner called it, also wounded the forgotten man. In the 1870s and 1880s, the era of Tweed and Tammany, municipal and county governments joined private contractors to build public structures. Sumner skewered such projects: ""They are carried out, not because they are needed in themselves, but because they will serve the turn of some private interest."" He added that ""the biggest job of all is a protective tariff,"" which generates forgotten men and forgotten costs to consumers.Sumner's forgotten man was a political phenomenon, a warning that supplied arguments for reformers of both parties. His chum William Whitney helped lead anti-Tammany Democrats and served in Grover Cleveland's cabinet.That we know so little about Sumner, who died in 1910, is evidence of the thoroughness of the progressive takeover of academic culture. By the early 1930s and the Great Depression, a different forgotten man had stepped onto the political stage. Raymond Moley, campaign adviser to New York's Gov. Franklin Roosevelt, was drafting a speech that the presidential candidate was to give on the Lucky Strike Radio Hour. ""I scraped from my memory an old phrase, 'The Forgotten Man,' which has haunted me for years,"" Moley later explained.The forgotten man FDR sketched was not the universal ""C"" but ""X,"" the man, as Roosevelt put it, ""at the bottom of the economic pyramid."" The key difference was that Roosevelt would single out specific groups, starting with the poor.FDR's forgotten man was the opposite of Sumner's. Roosevelt's predecessor as the Democrats' presidential nominee, Al Smith, objected to the switch. Smith, himself from the humblest of backgrounds, warned that highlighting class distinctions divided the country when it needed to pull together. ""The Forgotten Man is a myth,"" Smith said, ""and the sooner he disappears from the campaign the better it will be for the country.""FDR's forgotten man carried him to victory in 1932 and defined the platform of his subsequent presidential campaign. As the 1936 election neared, Roosevelt identified and rewarded one group of ""forgottens"" after another.Unions received the Wagner Act, the right to bargain collectively. Senior citizens received Social Security. Municipal lobbies got billions for ""jobbery."" The unemployed received payments or make-work jobs. At Howard University, Roosevelt thundered that ""there should be no forgotten men and no forgotten races.""This interest-group strategy netted FDR a stunning victory in 1936 -- 46 of 48 states -- and provided a template that has since served not only his party but also Latin American governments. The forgotten footnote is that the economic outcome of FDR's program vindicated Sumner. Remembering so many forgotten men meant forgetting the average worker. The slump that followed FDR's spending blitz drove unemployment back into the high teens.Hoisting FDR by his own rhetoric, an Indiana paper asked: ""Who is the forgotten man in Muncie? I know him as intimately as my own undershirt. He is the fellow that is trying to get along without public relief.""More recent sightings include Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign, when he spoke of ""the great majority of Americans, the forgotten Americans -- the non-shouters, the non-demonstrators.""And where stands Mr. Trump? With Sumner's anonymous crowd, or Roosevelt's specific groups? That Mr. Trump is by temperament a man of deals suggests he will be inclined toward FDR's way of thinking. Mr. Trump's Atlantic City projects fit perfectly into the Sumneresque definition of ""jobbery."" Mr. Trump's unabashed protectionism does not recall Roosevelt, an exception as a free trader, but it does recall the Democratic Party.But Mr. Trump does not pit rich against poor. He may end up standing more for the universal than the individual.We're told this election is ""different."" Perhaps different enough that we will get a real discussion of the consequences of rewarding groups. Sumner's distinction between ""jobbery"" and true capitalism is one that many voters would be thrilled to see Mr. Trump recognize. And how fabulous it would be if Hillary Clinton took on Mr. Trump over trade with the vigor of a Sumner. Here's an opening question for the first Trump-Clinton debate: ""Who is the forgotten man?""---Miss Shlaes, author of ""The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression"" (Harper, 2007), is a presidential scholar at King's College.Credit: By Amity Shlaes",10/21/16

""When Steve was not happy with you, I mean, the room shook,"" said Ken Moelis, an investment banking adviser and friend of Mr. Bollenbach. ""Smoke would be coming out."" Those eruptions quickly abated, though, and there were no hard feelings.Stephen Frasier Bollenbach was born July 14, 1942, in the Los Angeles area. As a teenager, he served ice cream at Disneyland. He earned a bachelor's degree in business at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a master's in business administration at California State University, Northridge.Before completing his schooling, he got a part-time job as a teller at a savings and loan. His boss there, John Notter, was struck by Mr. Bollenbach's precocious grasp of business. He was given a full-time job after graduation and followed Mr. Notter to another savings and loan, owned by Daniel K. Ludwig, a secretive billionaire with interests in shipping, real estate and a mammoth pulp project in Brazil that flopped. Messrs. Notter and Bollenbach helped steer Mr. Ludwig's financial affairs for more than a decade.In the 1980s, Mr. Bollenbach worked as the treasurer at Marriott Corp. and chief financial officer at Holiday Corp., which owned the Holiday Inn chain.Hired by the Trump Organization in 1990, Mr. Bollenbach drew up agreements calling for Mr. Trump to give up equity in casino, real estate and airline holdings in exchange for new terms on his debt and a release from $650 million in personal debt guarantees. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Trump said Tuesday Mr. Bollenbach had ""a brilliant financial mind.""Mr. Bollenbach returned to Marriott as chief financial officer in the early 1990s and found its stock price was weighed down because real-estate holdings were out of favor. His solution was to divide the company into two: Marriott International Inc., a high-growth hotel operator, and Host Marriott Corp., a debt-laden real-estate company. That led to downgrades of bonds and resulted in litigation, but Mr. Bollenbach, who became CEO of Host Marriott, prevailed in court.Mr. Bollenbach disliked making presentations to investors and often considered them a waste of time. As CEO of Host Marriott, the new real-estate company, he went on a roadshow to meet investors and made a stop at a financial firm in Philadelphia, where only a junior chemical analyst was available to hear the pitch.Afterward, an investment banker who had arranged the visit began apologizing. Mr. Bollenbach shushed him, and they returned to a limousine in silence. Mr. Bollenbach spotted a cheese-steak peddler and rolled down the window to ask whether he might want to buy any Host Marriott securities. The peddler was baffled. Mr. Bollenbach told the banker he had a better chance of selling securities to the cheese-steak vendor than the institution just visited.Disney recruited him in 1995 as chief financial officer under CEO Michael Eisner. Mr. Bollenbach helped persuade Mr. Eisner to pay $19 billion for Capital Cities/ABC Inc., the second-largest U.S. acquisition ever at that time. (""Without him, I would never have the courage to take on this much debt,"" Mr. Eisner said.) The Disney chief then hired the talent agent Michael Ovitz as president. That seemed to dilute Mr. Bollenbach's clout at Disney. Barron Hilton, son of the hotel company's founder, swooped in to hire Mr. Bollenbach as CEO of Hilton Hotels in 1996.When he arrived, Hilton had a strong brand but was ""just sort of plodding along,"" said Marc Grossman, who was a senior vice president at the hotel company. Within a week, Mr. Bollenbach presented a plan including purchases of casinos and hotels and wringing more value out of the Hilton brand. ""What we really had lacked was a clear, concise, achievable story and strategy, and here it was,"" Mr. Grossman said.Mr. Bollenbach bought the gambling company Bally Entertainment Corp. to give Hilton more scale in casinos, and later spun off the gaming operations. In 1997, Mr. Bollenbach tried to buy ITT Corp., owner of the Sheraton hotel brand, but he was outbid by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. The battle got ugly, and at one point Mr. Bollenbach called ITT's CEO, Rand Araskog, a ""weenie."" When Starwood prevailed, Mr. Bollenbach played down his disappointment. ""It's not as bad as when I stub my toe in the backyard,"" he said.He went on to make what colleagues say was a better deal, buying Promus Hotel Corp., giving Hilton a broader range of brands, including Hampton Inn. In 2007, Blackstone Group LP bought Hilton for $20 billion, and Mr. Bollenbach retired. He held board seats at companies including American International Group Inc. and Mondelez International Inc.In his spare time, Mr. Bollenbach drove sports cars including a Porsche 911 Turbo S and Ferrari Testarossa. He skied well, played golf poorly, collected wine and studied Civil War history. A family education fund he established provides scholarships.He is survived by his wife, Kimberly, whom he married in 2011, as well as two sons and two grandchildren from a previous marriage.Write to James R.

"The Media Do Scarlett; Trump's election threat is dumb, but the outrage is over the top.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1830500151?accountid=12768,"Quick, someone get the smelling salts for the media. Ever since that dastardly Donald Trump told Chris Wallace, ""I'll keep you in suspense"" about recognizing the election result, we haven't seen so much swooning and fainting since Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone With the Wind.""Starting with the 2000 election, it became Democratic writ that election outcomes could be questioned and contested. To this day many Democrats have convinced themselves, via repetition, that George W. Bush stole the 2000 election in Florida.In fact, Mr. Bush won the original count and the mandatory mini-recount. Virtually all serious attempts to finalize the Florida vote came to the same conclusion. Mr. Bush won. It was Al Gore who pushed the result into the courts of Florida in an effort to have the initial result overturned. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that enough was enough.The Florida recount fight made for great melodrama, but it was a media circus, and a destructive one. The partisan divide created by that sensational event is responsible in part for the divisions that endure to this day.Four years later, Democrats again argued extensively that George Bush stole the election from John Kerry because the President's campaign surrogates engineered the vote in Ohio against John Kerry. Mr. Kerry conceded the election, and it must be noted that he kept his own qualms private for many years.Both parties have since created a cottage industry dedicated to bird-dogging future election results in precincts around the country. And that's fine. Keep the politicians honest.Now comes Donald Trump, with his usual rank amateur flair, suggesting that if he loses it will be because the entire U.S. electoral system--presumably encompassing all 50 states--was fixed against him. As always, it fell to post-debate surrogates to make the distinctions he himself is incapable of making between discrete events--Illinois in 1960, Florida in 2000--and the legitimacy of the entire system.For failing to make any such distinction, Mr. Trump once again reaps a media whirlwind that blows his candidacy off Hillary Clinton's manifest vulnerabilities.None of that excuses the American media's faux fainting spell over this episode. We know that the normal cynicism of the media class hasn't been displaced by an endemic naivete about politics. The extraordinary overweighting of Mr. Trump's ham-handed and self-defeating remark will only feed the widespread public impression that the media are trying to preordain the election's outcome.",10/23/16
The Democratic Convention: Candidates Clash Over Foreign Policy --- An issue-by-issue look at how Clinton and Trump would deal with allies and foes,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807465516?accountid=12768,"The next U.S. president will confront a deeply unsettled world, with the Middle East in turmoil, Europe struggling to contain an outbreak of terror attacks and Russia expanding its influence. Here's a look at where the two presidential nominees, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, stand on a few key foreign-policy challenges.RussiaUnder President Vladimir Putin, Russia has sought to expand its power and international clout, often in ways that have heightened tensions with the U.S. Russian hackers have penetrated computer networks all over the world, including in the U.S. Russia has also threatened its neighbors in recent years.Mr. Trump has floated the idea of creating a new alliance with Russia, saying a reset of relations is necessary to help ease tensions in Syria and elsewhere. Mr. Putin has said complimentary things about Mr. Trump, leading some to suggest a close bond between them, which Mr. Trump has denied. This week, he invited Russia to unearth some of Mrs. Clinton's emails from her time as secretary of state, a statement alarming lawmakers from both political parties.Mrs. Clinton has called Mr. Putin a ""bully,"" and has described the relationship between the U.S. and Russia as complicated. As secretary of state, she worked to broker more cooperation between the two countries, posing in 2009 with Mr. Putin for a photo-op in which they pushed a big, red ""reset"" button. By the end of her tenure, she warned in a memo to President Barack Obama that relations with Russia had hit a low point and the ""reset"" in relations was over, according to people who saw the document.NATOU.S. relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization mark one of the biggest differences between the two, with Mr. Trump saying the U.S. is paying too much to keep the alliance afloat, and Mrs. Clinton portraying it as vital to U.S. interests in Europe.Mr. Trump wants allies within NATO to pay more for the overall protection of Europe. He has suggested the U.S. might leave the alliance if that doesn't happen during a Trump presidency. He also said NATO was obsolete and had to shift its focus away from Russian deterrence and more toward dealing with terrorism and migration flows.Mrs. Clinton says that leaving NATO would only embolden Moscow. She has praised the existence of the alliance and said the U.S. should do more to strengthen allies, particularly against Russian aggression. She has said that NATO allies rallied to the U.S.'s aid after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and that the U.S. should be prepared to do the same.Islamic StateThe rise of the terror network Islamic State since 2013 has reshaped how the U.S. and other countries view Muslims and confront terror. It has also opened sharp divides between the candidates.Mr. Trump has said he won't give a fully detailed plan to defeat Islamic State, also known as ISIS, because it would take away the element of surprise. But he has said he would ""bomb the shit"" out of the group's oil operations. He said it could take 30,000 U.S. troops to defeat ISIS in the Middle East, but he hasn't committed to deploying a force of that size. To deal with suspected terrorists, he has proposed changing international rules that forbid the military's use of torture.Mrs. Clinton has said Sunni Muslims and Kurdish forces should play a bigger role in combating ISIS, and has also called for expanding U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to defeat the terror network. She has called for combating Islamic State's ability to use social media to recruit, train, and plan attacks, urging more cooperation from tech firms.ImmigrationImmigration has emerged as one of the most divisive issues of the 2016 campaign, with Republicans reversing course from an earlier push to enact a bipartisan overhaul of immigration rules. The focus has shifted in recent months to immigration rules for people fleeing places like Syria and other unstable regimes in the Middle East.Mr. Trump has called for building a roughly 1,000 mile wall, financed by Mexico, to secure the U.S.'s southern border. He has said the threats posed by Islamic extremists are too dangerous and that stark new measures must be put in place to bar entry to Muslims from certain countries. He has called for ending ""birthright citizenship,"" which is the legal process for granting citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.Mrs. Clinton has said banning the entry of Muslims into the U.S. -- even the proposal of it -- will alienate Muslim allies in the Middle East and harm U.S. relations.She has called for a comprehensive immigration overhaul, including a pathway to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally, aside from violent criminals.Credit: By Damian Paletta",10/25/16
Clinton Makes Her Pitch --- Nominee to Take On Trump in Rust Belt,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807463912?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Hillary Clinton's first order of business after the Democratic convention is a bus trip in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Ohio, the opening move in a strategy to defend her party's grip on states President Barack Obama won and to brand her rival as unfit to be president.It shows a campaign eager to close off a likely effort by Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, to build an Electoral College majority by winning working-class, white voters in the Rust Belt and other slowly diversifying states. Democrats hope to capitalize on a convention that has drawn stronger television ratings so far than those for the Republican convention last week.Initially viewing Mr. Trump as possibly the weakest general-election candidate in the Republican primary field, Mrs. Clinton's allies now accept that the campaign will be a slog. Polling shows the two candidates are running about even in the popular vote.""I fully expect this to be a close and competitive election all the way through the end,"" said Geoff Garin, a pollster and strategist in Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.Mrs. Clinton has used the convention to address a basic vulnerability: Voters largely don't trust or like her. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this month showed that 20% of Democrats have a negative view of her -- a higher number than for any Democratic nominee in the last quarter-century.A string of convention speakers from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to President Barack Obama, told stories during the convention meant to show a warmer, more empathetic face of the former secretary of state, senator and first lady.As Mrs. Clinton tries to make an affirmative case for herself, another clear goal of the Clinton campaign is to undercut Mr. Trump, who himself is viewed negatively by a majority of voters, by raising concerns that he is so temperamentally unstable he can't be trusted with the nuclear codes.John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, told reporters this week that the way to win is to demonstrate Mr. Trump is ""unfit, that he's unprepared and that we can't put him in the Oval Office."" He added: ""That's the core of our strategy.""Republicans counter Mrs. Clinton's persona is a liability. Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman, said in an interview: ""This is not an election about policy and ideology. It's an election about, 'What do I think of you as a leader.' She has a lot of qualifications, but they just don't trust her or like her. That's hard"" to overcome.Mr. Trump's campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Clinton aides are looking at the electoral map in granular detail to plot the best path to 270 electoral votes. It's no accident that Mrs. Clinton is planning a trip on Monday to Omaha. Under Nebraska's unusual system, candidates can pick up Electoral College votes by winning specific congressional districts. Mr. Obama picked up one electoral vote in 2008 by capturing the district that includes Omaha.The campaign also hopes to retake North Carolina, a state that Mr. Obama won in 2008 but lost in 2012. Mrs. Clinton has made repeated trips to the state -- the latest to Charlotte on Monday.Even Utah might be in play. Robby Mook, the Clinton campaign manager, said this week that the traditionally Republican state, which hasn't voted for the Democratic nominee since 1964, is a ""heavy lift."" But he added that Mr. Trump created ""headwinds"" for himself, having ""alienated the Mormon Church.""At a rally in Utah in March, Mr. Trump questioned whether the 2012 GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, was truly a Mormon.""While I think it's going to be a close election in terms of the popular vote, she does have a distinct advantage in terms of the Electoral College map,"" Mr. Garin said. He said that she has ""many more pathways"" to an Electoral College majority than Mr. Trump has.For Mr. Trump to win, he would need to flip some states that Democrats have been winning, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, which helps explain why Mrs. Clinton's bus tour starts in those two states, said David Axelrod, a former Obama White House and campaign adviser. ""He's trying to put this together primarily among white voters,"" Mr. Axelrod said.Mrs. Clinton will start her bus tour accompanied by Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.), her running mate. A roster of high-profile campaign surrogates also will stump for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama's political team has been coordinating closely with the Clinton campaign and expects the president to be a frequent presence on the trail in the fall. With a job approval rating topping 50%, Mr. Obama can be particularly helpful in mobilizing minority voters and getting them to vote.Mark Penn, a senior strategist in Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential race, said, ""She now has an almost unprecedented team of surrogates, from President Clinton, who is great with swing voters, to President Obama, who can fire up the base and whose ratings have been rising.""(See related article: ""Candidate Underlines Contrasts to Rival"" -- WSJ July 29, 2016)Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Carol E.

Election 2016: Trump Says Russia Remarks 'Sarcastic',http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807463108?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Thursday his comments inviting Russia to dig up Hillary Clinton's lost emails -- which caused an uproar from much of the U.S. national-security community -- weren't meant to be taken literally.""Of course, I'm being sarcastic,"" Mr. Trump said during an appearance on Fox News.Asked about fears that Russia might be meddling in the U.S. election, a top U.S. intelligence official on Thursday said Moscow could be seeking payback for what it viewedas concerted attempts by the U.S. to interfere in elections in Russia.""They see a U.S. conspiracy behind every bush and ascribe far more impact than we're actually guilty of, but that's their mind-set,"" said U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking at a security conference in Aspen, Colo.Mr. Clapper said U.S. intelligence agencies haven't reached a firm conclusion on whether Russia or any other country was behind the recent computer breach that stole emails and other records from the Democratic National Committee.""I'll just say that don't think we're quite ready yet to make a call on attribution,"" Mr. Clapper said. ""I mean, we all know there are just a few usual suspects out there. But in terms of the process that we try to stick to, I don't think we're ready to make a public call yet.""Close to 20,000 of those emails were released by WikiLeaks last week, a move that proved embarrassing to senior DNC officials because they involved plots in some cases to undermine the presidential candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned after the emails were made public.The remarks by the nation's top intelligence chief came as Mr. Trump rejected criticism of his invitation Wednesday to the Russian government to hack into the emails of Mrs. Clinton, his Democratic rival.In the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""a better leader"" than President Barack Obama.""He's a better leader than Obama, because Obama's not a leader, so he's certainly doing a better job than Obama is,"" Mr. Trump said.Though Mr. Trump's invitation to the Russia government drew bipartisan criticism, the White House on Thursday said the GOP nominee would soon begin receiving classified intelligence briefings.""The administration is confident that they can both provide relevant and sufficient briefings to the two major party presidential candidates, while also protecting sensitive national security information,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.In response to a question about recent comments by Mr. Trump on foreign policy, particularly the U.S. relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the development of nuclear weapons in Asia, Mr. Clapper said he wouldn't offer any opinion. But he said he has heard concerns from his counterparts overseas based on rhetoric on the campaign trail. ""I can say with some authority that such statements, such rhetoric are very bothersome to our foreign interlocutors, our foreign partners,"" he said.Credit: By Damian Paletta and Reid J.

The Democratic Convention: Clinton Aide Needles Trump on Strategy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807235491?accountid=12768,"PHILADELPHIA -- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager on Wednesday challenged Donald Trump's statement that he could be competitive in Democratic strongholds, urging the Republican nominee to stump in traditionally blue states.Robby Mook joked that he stands ready to help Mr. Trump forge a game plan for competing in northeastern states where Republicans have long struggled. ""I absolutely encourage Donald Trump to spend time campaigning in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey,"" Mr. Mook said at a lunch hosted by The Wall Street Journal.In response, Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, said: ""Sun Tzu once said that overconfidence creates situations where you will be defeated by the unexpected. The Clinton campaign would be wise to take this to heart when facing a national grass-roots movement looking to break up the rigged system in Washington and elect a true outsider like Donald Trump.""Mr. Trump repeatedly has asserted that he will expand the traditional battleground and carve a path to the White House by winning states where Republican presidential candidates rarely compete. The New York businessman has said his home state could be in play in the November election. And he has called New Jersey a second home, saying that he expects to do well there.Mr. Mook appeared to give such statements little credence, quipping that the Clinton team would help the GOP nominee develop an itinerary for campaigning in those states.For his part, the Clinton campaign manager identified North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Florida as key battlegrounds in this election.Some political pundits have suggested that Georgia, which has backed Republican presidential candidates in the last five presidential elections, could be more competitive in this election. But Mr. Mook shied away from any bold predictions.Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",10/25/16
Trump Urges Russia To Wade Into Race,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807235441?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump invited Russia on Wednesday to unearth some of Hillary Clinton's missing emails from her time as secretary of state, drawing sharp criticism that he was urging a foreign power to spy on the U.S.The comments, which Mr. Trump echoed on Twitter but that his campaign later sought to play down, came in the midst of a week in which Democrats accused Russia of attempting to meddle in the U.S. presidential election by hacking the Democratic National Committee's computers and handing over embarrassing emails to the WikiLeaks website. The accusations also cast a new spotlight on Mr. Trump's expressions of respect for Russian President Vladimir Putin.""Russia -- if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Mr. Trump told reporters at his resort near Miami. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.""Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, turned over about 30,000 emails to the State Department as part of a probe into her use of a private email server. Her attorneys said they erased another 30,000 they deemed personal.Mr. Trump's remarks came as part of an effort by the GOP candidate to draw media coverage during the week of the Democratic convention.National-security experts reacted sharply. ""If he is talking about the State Department emails on her server, he is inviting a foreign intelligence service to steal sensitive American government information,"" said Michael Hayden, head of the Central Intelligence Agency under President George W. Bush.Timothy Naftali, co-director of New York University's Center for the United States and the Cold War, said he was ""flabbergasted"" by Mr. Trump's comments. ""Even in jest, a presidential candidate should not give any foreign power anything but zero tolerance about espionage,"" he said. ""He sent a signal to foreign powers that it's open season on U.S. secrets.""Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook condemned ""the idea that you'd have any American, let alone a presidential nominee from a major party, calling for a foreign power to commit espionage in the U.S.""Adding to the sense that Mr. Trump had veered badly, his campaign released a statement from his running mate, Indiana Gov.Mike Pence, that took a more confrontational approach toward Russia minutes after the press conference ended.Mr. Pence threatened that ""both parties and the United States government"" will ensure ""serious consequences"" if the Federal Bureau of Investigation finds Russia responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee emails, which WikiLeaks released on the eve of the convention. The emails showed party officials plotting to undermine Mrs. Clinton's challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan echoed Mr. Pence's stance. ""Russia is a global menace led by a devious thug. Putin should stay out of this election,"" said Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck.Former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said Mr. Trump was kidding about Russia looking for Mrs. Clinton's emails. ""The media seems more upset by Trump's joke about Russian hacking than by the fact that Hillary's personal server was vulnerable to Russia,"" he said on Twitter.Later Wednesday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller sought to quell the mounting backlash to Mr. Trump's remarks. ""To be clear, Mr. Trump did not call on, or invite, Russia or anyone else to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mails today,"" he said on Twitter.Mr. Trump was asked in the news conference whether he was urging Russia to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails. ""That's up to the president,"" he said, referring to Mr. Putin. He added he had no intention to give orders to the Russian leader. ""I'm not going to tell Putin what to do,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Why should I tell Putin what to do?""Before Mr. Trump's remarks, the Russian government said it doesn't interfere in elections of other countries. ""President Putin has repeatedly said that Russia never interfered and never interferes in the domestic affairs, especially not the electoral processes, of other countries,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russian news agencies. U.S. politicians were creating ""Russian boogeyman stories,"" he added.Mr. Trump has drawn rebukes from Republicans and Democrats for trading compliments with Mr. Putin during the GOP primaries.On Wednesday night, Leon Panetta, former defense secretary and director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama, declared at the Democratic convention: ""Donald Trump today once again took Russia's side . . . In an unstable world, we cannot afford unstable leadership.""Trump spokesman Stephen Miller took issue with Mr. Panetta for keeping silent about Mrs. Clinton's email server and other issues: ""He better than most should know how many lives she put at risk.""Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Trump sought to distance himself from the Russian president.""I never met Putin. I don't know who Putin is,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly, but there's nothing I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly, as opposed to the way they are right now, so that we can go and knock out ISIS.""Mr. Trump's claim contradicted what he said about his relationship with Mr. Putin at a debate in November. ""I got to know him very well because we were both on '60 Minutes,' we were stablemates, and we did very well that night,"" he said.According to a political watchdog group called FactCheck.org, the two men did appear on the same ""60 Minutes"" episode, which aired on Sept. 27.

Trump's Putin Illusions,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807218657?accountid=12768,"Will someone -- calling Ivanka -- please tell Donald Trump that Vladimir Putin is no friend of America, or for that matter of Donald Trump? An intervention is needed after the Republican's mouth-in-foot press conference Wednesday in which he invited Russia to turn over Hillary Clinton's 33,000 missing emails from her private server.""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,"" Mr. Trump said at his South Florida resort. ""They probably have them. I'd like to have them released.""The man who is representing millions of Republican voters between now and November added, when given a chance to reconsider, that ""If Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them."" So would we, and everyone else in the media if they're honest, but that doesn't mean a presidential candidate should appear to invite a Kremlin hack.The Clinton campaign pounced on the news, and House Speaker Paul Ryan said he disagreed with Mr. Trump's comments. So, perhaps, did others in the Trump entourage, because the campaign quickly rolled out a statement from vice presidential nominee Mike Pence that took a much more sensible line.""The FBI will get to the bottom of who is behind the hacking. If it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences,"" Mr. Pence said in the statement. Let's hope so, though given how delicately the Obama Administration has treated hacks by China and North Korea, we aren't so sure.Mr. Trump's comments are indefensible on their own, but they are even more concerning because they come in the context of the nominee's seeming bromance with Mr. Putin. He's often said he likes the authoritarian for his ability to get his way -- military imperialism works that way -- and the American seems to think his superior negotiating skills would outwit the strongman.Get over it, Donald. George W. Bush looked into Mr. Putin's eyes and found him ""straightforward and trustworthy,"" only to have Russia invade Georgia. President Obama vowed a ""reset"" with Russia, and Mr. Putin returned the favor by invading Ukraine and buzzing NATO jets. You don't have to credit the conspiracy theories that Mr. Putin has something on Mr. Trump to conclude that the Republican needs a crash course in geopolitics. Even as a nominee who hasn't been elected, his statements are followed around the world by adversaries looking for weaknesses to exploit.At the same time the press corps should hold Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama to the same standard. Four years ago Mr. Obama famously mocked Mitt Romney for saying that Russia was America's foremost ""geopolitical foe."" Mr. Obama said the 1980s are ""calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years."" Mr. Romney was right.As for Mrs. Clinton, she wasn't merely a candidate when she exposed America's top secrets on her private email. She was Secretary of State. She thus made herself and the U.S. vulnerable to Mr. Putin's blackmail. That's at least as troubling as Mr. Trump's geopolitical illusions.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Trump Has No Putin Illusions on Email Hacks"" -- WSJ August 2, 2016)",10/25/16

His last term as Mayor was a disaster!"" Mr. Trump tweeted Friday morning.Mr. Trump later posted that Mr. Bloomberg, who left City Hall in December 2013 after serving 12 years as mayor, wouldn't get 10% of the vote if he ran again.""They would run him out of town!"" he wrote.Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump had been cordial over the years but never close friends, according to people who know them.

Why Donald Trump Is No Gentleman,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807674013?accountid=12768,"The most obvious observation about Donald Trump is one rarely made: He is not a gentleman. ""Not a gentleman"" is a designation and reproach he richly deserves but has not received. And why is that? ""Gentleman"" is no longer a standard we enforce or even a term we use. The outstanding person in this election is Donald Trump, in that he attracts the most attention, but the outstanding fact is the voters behind him who excuse Mr. Trump for his ungentlemanly behavior.A gentleman -- to define him quickly -- is a man who is gentle by habit and character, and not because he is somehow forced to be. Character is key. The Donald has said in one of his performances on Bill O'Reilly's television show that he ""likes to be a gentleman"" with women, a generous gesture of his. And one of his girlfriends declared that the New York Times had got her story wrong: She was not demeaned or offended by Mr. Trump; to her he was a ""gentleman.""This is pretty thin testimony. What would Carly Fiorina and Megyn Kelly say of their experience as Mr. Trump's targets? Also, a gentleman would prefer to be thought of as a gentleman rather than be praised as one, let alone boast of it himself.John McCain would expect, though not require, us to recognize his honorable conduct in a Communist prison camp during the Vietnam War as being beyond just reward. To Mr. Trump, however, Mr. McCain was a loser for having had the bad luck to be captured by the North Vietnamese. (""I like people who weren't captured,"" Mr. Trump said.) When the Republicans put Mr. McCain up for the presidency, Mr. Trump implied, they were nominating a loser.They compounded their mistake in the next presidential election by nominating Mitt Romney, another gentlemanly loser. Now Republicans have the opportunity to put up a winner, or at least one who believes in winning, namely himself. With his disdain for Mr. McCain, Trump makes it clear that, for him, winning dishonorably is better than losing honorably.This is Machiavelli in a nutshell. But Machiavelli said that one should either caress or eliminate a rival, never merely insult him. With an insult, you leave the rival alive to seek revenge. Yet Mr. Trump does not fear the revenge of John McCain or Mitt Romney or their Republican supporters. He ""tells it like it is,"" meaning that he is bold enough to say what he likes about his rivals and enemies. He is free; the rest of us are afraid, but we have the admiration of the timid for one who is fearless, he believes.We shall see how far this policy takes him. Mr. Trump is not quite a liar, because a liar tries to conceal truths inconvenient to him -- or her. It's more that he doesn't care, or doesn't even know, whether he lies or not.Readers will have noted that my argument suffers from deplorable, out-of-date sexism. Machiavelli was the boldest teacher against the honor of the gentleman, but he too was an old-fashioned sexist. There are several reasons why the gentleman has lost his good repute in addition to the fundamental Machiavellian one, picked up by Mr. Trump, that he is not a winner: The gentleman is also not necessarily a commercial success, nor is he a democratic figure. But today the main objection is that he is not gender-neutral.To make the gentleman gender-neutral, it is necessary to transform him into a sensitive male. He must begin to check his unconscious habits of male superiority, take note of the sensibilities and vulnerabilities of women, and submit to affirmative action. In new programs of retraining, he must learn the prudent ways of women and unlearn the irrational vagaries of men. He probably won't do all this on his own; so he must be required to become politically correct.Is there much doubt that Donald Trump represents resistance to this plan on the part of men and of those women who say they like ""real men""? It isn't that he cares about a cause, but as a demagogue he loves to be loved, and as a vulgar man he has an affinity for whatever is vulgar. Incapable as he is of appreciating the gentleman, Mr. Trump earns the disdain of the promoters of gender neutrality. Mr. Trump's resistance to political correctness, however, has the coarseness of a male. Or what used to be the coarseness of a male. Now that women are practicing to swear like sailors, Mr. Trump is a reminder of male superiority in the department of vulgarity. Surely no woman would have run his campaign.Those of us who hanker for the return for some part at least of the gentleman are in a fix. We are caught between distaste for a man who is not a gentleman and dislike of the political correctness that he so energetically attacks -- yet whose effect he illustrates.---Mr. Mansfield, a professor of government at Harvard University, is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: 'Lady' and 'Gentleman' Need Not Apply in '16"" -- WSJ August 6, 2016)Credit: By Harvey C.

Donald Trump Supporter Darrell Issa Faces Tough Re-Election Fight in California; President Obama among Democrats targeting the one-time House Oversight Committee chairman,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1832870729?accountid=12768,"Rep. Darrell Issa, a Donald Trump supporter and one of President Barack Obama's staunchest congressional critics, is facing his stiffest re-election challenge as national Democrats target one of California's last Republican bastions: Orange County.The Cook Political Report this month declared the race a ""toss up"" in Mr. Issa's district, which spans southern Orange County and portions of northern San Diego, including Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton--a startling development for the 62-year-old who has won election eight times.His Democratic rival, Doug Applegate, 62, is a former Marine colonel, an Iraq war veteran and a military lawyer now in private practice. He retired from service in 2006 after 32 years, and is running on a platform of job creation, opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and improving health-care and job opportunities for veterans. He described his opponent as a ""poster boy for Washington dysfunction [who] always puts his party ahead of our country.""Mr. Issa is emphasizing his legislative record, pointing to a report by researchers at the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University that rated him the second-most effective Republican lawmaker in Congress. He is the wealthiest member of Congress, having run a vehicle antitheft device company before he was elected to Congress in 2000.Democrats would need to win a net of 30 seats to recapture the House majority for the first time since 2010. Mr. Trump's slide in the polls has made Democrats more confident they can winnow the House GOP majority, even if regaining control of the chamber remains something of a long shot.""This district is definitely going to become more of a swing seat,"" said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data Inc., a California research firm that provides data to both parties. ""If not in this year, in subsequent years, Darrell Issa is going to start feeling pressure from millennials registering, and other changing demographics.""From his perch as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee from 2011 to 2015, Mr. Issa launched a series of investigations into the Obama administration. They included probes about the deadly attack in 2012 against U.S. personnel in Benghazi, Libya, the failed ""Fast and Furious"" arms sting by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and the Internal Revenue Service's treatment of nonprofits aligned with conservative causes.Mr. Obama, one of Mrs. Clinton's top surrogates, made clear Mr. Issa's seat is a target . Speaking Sunday at a La Jolla, Calif., fundraiser for congressional Democrats, the president mocked Mr. Issa for featuring him in a recent mail advertisement that said he was ""very pleased"" the president signed legislation he co-sponsored.""This is now a guy who because poll numbers are bad has sent out brochures with my picture on it, touting his cooperation on issues with me,"" Mr. Obama said. ""That is shameless.""""I'm disappointed but not surprised that the president, in a political speech, continues to deny accountability for the serious scandals that happened under his watch where Americans died overseas and veterans have died here at home,"" Mr. Issa said in response to the president's comments.Democrats say Mr. Issa wasn't an original co-sponsor of the bill and had little to do with getting the law passed. A spokesman for Mr. Issa said he advocated for the bill by writing an editorial, and made it a ""top priority.""In a statement to the Journal, the bill's author, Rep. Mimi Walters, a Republican, praised Mr. Issa's leadership on the matter.Some Democrats believe Hillary Clinton could win Orange County, which would make her the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.If that happens, ""it would mean that the Republicans have lost the last stronghold in California,"" said Henry Vandermeir, chair of the Orange County Democratic Party. ""That will start making this county a lot more progressive.""The Orange County border has long been dubbed ""the Orange Curtain""--a demarcation of conservatism and wealth from traditionally more diverse, liberal Los Angeles. Orange County, the birthplace of former President Richard Nixon , with a large population of military veterans, has voted Republican for decades.But demographic changes have created an opening for Democrats. Latino registration this year ticked up a point to 13% of voters, while millennial registration rose four points to 26% since the 2012 election. About 46% of new registrants this year have been millennials, according to Political Data.In California's June 7th primary, where candidates of all parties face-off, Mr. Applegate won 45.5% of the vote compared with 50.8% by Mr. Issa.The veteran population still figures prominently in the county and the congressional district, and Democrats are going out of their way to feature their candidate's military experience.Still, Mr. Issa enjoys an eight-point advantage in the number of registered Republican voters in the district over Democrats, according to state data.Democrats have sought to make Mr. Issa's continued support of Mr. Trump an issue, gambling that higher-educated, wealthier Republicans will also be turned off by the GOP nominee.""Issa has two people to blame for his predicament: Donald Trump and himself,"" said David Wasserman, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ""It's a Republican-leaning seat, but the Republicans are wealthy and well-educated, and they don't like Trump.""Educational attainment is high in the 49th District, with 43.5% having a bachelor's degree or more, compared with a national figure of about 33%. Mr. Trump has struggled to win highly educated voters.The House Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic candidates for Congress, said last week it had begun airing an ad supporting Mr. Applegate, an airtime purchase worth about $660,000. That followed about $2.1 million worth of airtime purchased by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official campaign arm for Democrats in Congress.Mr. Issa's campaign has so far spent $2.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Carol E.

""Sometimes things don't always come out like you mean, right?

""But I was raised to believe that leaders speak the truth.""Mr. Pence said he is glad to stand with Mr. Trump, who ""doesn't go tiptoeing around"" political correctness and controversy.""Not since Ronald Reagan in my lifetime has there been a man or a woman at the national level who has understood and heard the frustrations and the aspirations of the American people the way Donald Trump does,"" he said.Debra Newman, a 61-year-old teacher's assistant from suburban Raleigh, said she is glad that Mr. Pence is on the ticket.

Clinton Expands Lead Over Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809029981?accountid=12768,"Republican Donald Trump showed signs that he is trying to get his campaign back on track amid a series of recent missteps, as a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Democrat Hillary Clinton opening a 9-point lead nationally over the New York businessman.Mrs. Clinton's lead, at 47% to 38%, grew from 5 percentage points before the conventions in July. The finding comes as Mr. Trump and anxious Republicans are trying to shift focus away from GOP infighting and personality politics.At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday, a more restrained Mr. Trump read parts of his speech from notes and kept his attention trained on Mrs. Clinton.""Hillary Clinton can never be trusted with national security,"" he said, which elicited cheers of ""Lock her up!""The Journal/NBC News poll of 800 registered voters was taken after both parties' national conventions and after Mr. Trump became mired in controversy for criticizing Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier killed in the Iraq war. He stirred additional tensions within his party this week by refusing to endorse the re-election of House Speaker Paul Ryan in next week's primary, capping one of the rockiest stretches of Mr. Trump's campaign.The decline in Mr. Trump's national standing is in keeping with a spate of battleground-state polls that found an erosion of Mr. Trump's support. Those included surveys released Wednesday and Thursday showing Mrs. Clinton with double-digit leads in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire and ahead by 9 points in Michigan.Republicans have been hoping to make those states competitive on the strength of Mr. Trump's support among working-class, white voters. But those surveys and the new Journal/NBC News poll indicate that while Mr. Trump has solidified support among that group, he has been losing support among college-educated and suburban voters, whom he also needs to win the general election.The Journal/NBC News poll found Mrs. Clinton winning among white voters with four-year college degrees by 7 percentage points, 47% to 40%. Mitt Romney, the GOP's nominee in 2012, had won that group by 14 points. Before the conventions, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump were essentially tied among those voters, separated by only 1 percentage point.Similar patterns appeared in the new battleground-state surveys. A Franklin & Marshall poll of Pennsylvania voters, which showed Mrs. Clinton with an 11-point overall lead in the state, found a lopsided, 40-point lead for the Democrat in Southeastern Pennsylvania, including the Philadelphia suburbs, where residents tend to have relatively high incomes and educational attainment.Former Sen. Trent Lott (R., Miss.) is among the many Trump supporters who think Mr. Trump needs to change his tone and stop attacking other Republicans to avoid alienating more voters.""The rhetoric has to change, and it has to change soon if he's going to stop the erosion and bring people back who are looking for a way to be for him,"" said Mr. Lott.There are signs that Mr. Trump is trying to retrain his focus after days in which Republicans inside and outside the campaign implored him to unleash his ire on the Democratic nominee, not Messrs. Khan or Ryan.At the Portland rally, he stayed largely on message and focused on Mrs. Clinton. He spoke at length about a Wall Street Journal report this week that the U.S. had secretly transferred $400 million in cash to Iran just as the country released four detained Americans.Calling the move ""just sickening,"" Mr. Trump said that electing Mrs. Clinton would be akin to ""four more years of Obama.""The Clinton campaign's press secretary responded on Twitter, saying she had nothing to do with the payment, which occurred several years after she left office.To get others on the same page, the Trump campaign is this week circulating a memo to supporters urging them tofocus on ""Clinton's blatant dishonesty to the American public."" That is a shift from talking points circulated earlier this week on Capitol Hill, which centered on the dust-up with Mr. Khan and his wife and the ""crooked"" presidential debate schedule.Susie Wiles, who is helping run Mr. Trump's campaign in Florida, pointed to the large and high-spirited crowds that greeted him in Florida on Wednesday. ""I think the ship, which has been listing ever so slightly, seems to be righted,"" Ms. Wiles said.Allies of Mr. Trump have promised on prior occasions that he would be more ""presidential,"" only to see the candidate stir up another controversy.Penny Nance, chief executive of Concerned Women for America, a group that opposes abortion rights and favors traditional marriage, said she was hoping Mr. Trump would learn from his mistakes. But she cautioned, ""I have learned to be really skeptical, because every time I think he's done, he's not.""In a two-way race, Mrs. Clinton now leads among male voters 43% to 42%. She leads among women 51%-35%.The poll also found that Mrs. Clinton retained a 9-point lead when third-party candidates are included on the ballot. In a four-way match up, the poll found Mrs. Clinton drew 43%, while Mr. Trump had 34%, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson had 10% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein drew 5%.The poll found that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump continued to be viewed more negatively than positively by voters. But it found a small improvement in Mrs. Clinton's image: 37% viewed her positively, while 53% viewed her negatively. Last month, the split was 34% positive, 56% negative.Feelings about Mr. Trump remained almost unchanged from the prior month, with 28% viewing him positively and 61% viewing him negatively.The survey was conducted July 31 to Aug. 3. Its margin of error was plus or minus 3.46 percentage points.---Rebecca Ballhaus and Dante Chinni contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook and Beth Reinhard",10/27/16

"Early Voting Bolsters Hillary Clinton in Key States; Democrat sees enthusiasm in Florida and Nevada, while Donald Trump holds his own in Ohio",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1833158049?accountid=12768,"Democrat Hillary Clinton appears to have a slight edge over Republican rival Donald Trump in a number of battleground states and among important demographic groups based on an analysis of the millions of votes already cast both at polling places and by absentee ballot.Mrs. Clinton is seeing positive signs of enthusiasm in such states as Florida and Nevada. She is also seeing strong turnout rates in the early vote from Latinos and women.But Mr. Trump may have an advantage in the midwestern battlegrounds of Ohio and Iowa, where Democratic voter interest appears to be flagging compared with the 2012 presidential, records show.According to data compiled by the United States Elections Project and the Associated Press, at least 17 million votes had already been cast as of Friday. Early voting is under way in a number of top-tier battlegrounds including Florida, Nevada, Iowa and North Carolina. Absentee voting has been happening in some form in every state, thanks to laws that require military and overseas ballots to be ready by September.""Clinton has opened up a national lead in the polling, and there are some states that have been following that lead in the state polling,"" said Michael McDonald, who runs the United States Elections Project and is one of the foremost experts on early voting. ""We can also see similar patterns of movement in the early vote as well.""Ballots are secret, but many states release the partisan registration of the voters requesting and returning absentee ballots or voting in-person. While those numbers don't take into account voters who cross over and vote for a candidate of the other party, the early numbers can provide clues into voter enthusiasm and the potential makeup of the electorate.In Florida, Republicans typically have an advantage in early and absentee voting numbers, but this year, the parties are in a virtual dead heat in ballot returns and votes cast. Democrats also cite an increase in female and Latino participation in early voting, with the Clinton campaign using state data to note that 133,000 Latino voters have returned ballots--a 99% increase from this point in 2012. Republicans note that the early-voting sites in some GOP-leaning counties aren't yet open.In Nevada, the first week of early and absentee voting showed Democrats ahead by about 25,000 votes on the strength of returns in Clark County, the state's population center that includes Las Vegas. Democrats attribute their strength among the state's Latino voters for the increase. Republicans are running in closer in Washoe County, home to Reno. The GOP is also ahead in absentee ballots statewide.In North Carolina , the number of early voting sites in the state has been reduced since the last election, but participation is about on par with this point in 2012. As of Friday, Democrats led in early voting and absentee-ballot returns in North Carolina by more than 100,000 votes.Despite a strong early performance in 2012, President Barack Obama lost North Carolina that year, and Mrs. Clinton will need big turnout from black voters, who are down as a share of voters in early returns, according to state data.Only a handful of states release data about the gender of early voters, but the figures that are available shows female ballot returns are outpacing male ones, according to numbers compiled by the United States Elections Project. Mrs. Clinton has built her polling lead on her strength with women.Republican operatives say they aren't alarmed by early voting trends in the battleground states, with one Republican National Committee official saying the states the party hopes to win are still within reach.In Iowa and Ohio, early voting points to lackluster Democratic interest rather than a groundswell of Republican enthusiasm. Key counties around Cleveland and Columbus show lower levels of Democratic early voting, Mr. McDonald said.The story is similar in Iowa, where Republicans are flat in terms of ballots requested, at about 175,000, and the 116,000 ballots that have been already cast is down about 11,000 from four years ago. Democrats, however, are down much more, and Mrs. Clinton on Friday headed to Iowa to try to boost those numbers.Dante Chinni contributed to this article.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comRelated Coverage* Florida Battle Map: Where Clinton and Trump Must Concentrate Efforts* Voter Guide: Find Answers to Your Election Questions Online* Florida Once Again a Focus in 2016 CampaignCredit: By Byron Tau",10/31/16

""Working hand in hand, we will work to grow our majority in the House and Senate.""Reading from notes, which he rarely does during campaign speeches, Mr. Trump cited the need for Republican unity. It came after all three lawmakers criticized the presidential nominee over his attacks on the parents of a slain U.S. soldier.""We will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory and importantly, toward real change,"" he said.Mr. Ryan, who faces a primary challenge in the coming week, wasn't in attendance, nor was Sen. Ron Johnson, who faces a difficult challenge from former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold. And Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who delivered a full-throated endorsement of Mr. Trump at the Republican convention last month, was instead attending a spaghetti dinner Friday night in Grand View, a northwestern Wisconsin community.Mr. Trump's nod to Mr. Ryan, Mr. McCain and Ms. Ayotte comes four days after he declined to back the three during an interview with the Washington Post. Mr. Trump had also praised Mr. Ryan's long-shot primary challenger, Paul Nehlen, on Twitter and in interviews. Mr. Nehlen, in a statement released by his campaign, claimed Mr. Trump's delay in backing Mr. Ryan as endorsement enough.Still, Mr. Trump's campaign immediately sought to capitalize on his backing of Mr. Ryan.""I have officially endorsed Paul Ryan -- and together, we will fight for YOU, and together we will Make America Great Again!"" Mr. Trump wrote to supporters in a fundraising email minutes after he announced his support for the House speaker.Tweaking Mr. Ryan and encouraging his opponent infuriated Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has emerged as Mr. Trump's chief ambassador to fellow Republicans.

Election 2016: Trump Could Slow Tax Audit,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809581540?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump says he will release his tax returns when an IRS audit concludes, dangling the possibility of unveiling the documents before the election. The Republican presidential nominee omits one major point: He and his attorneys have substantial knowledge about when the audit will end and some ability to slow the process.The existence of audits going back as far as to 2009 indicates Mr. Trump has given the Internal Revenue Service permission to extend its work beyond a three-year statute of limitations for such inquiries, said lawyers who specialize in tax disputes, who add such extensions are routine. Mr. Trump's lawyers know the IRS's deadlines, and can take their time negotiating settlements and responding to document requests, these lawyers said.""He certainly has a lot of influence over the audit ending sooner or later,"" said Bryan Skarlatos of Kostelanetz & Fink LLP. ""It would be relatively easy at this point to extend the audit beyond the elections.""Robert McKenzie, a tax lawyer at Arnstein & Lehr LLP, said it was ""close to impossible"" that the multiyear audit would finish by Election Day. ""The complexity -- even if they had a handshake agreement -- of getting it memorialized into a deal could take months,"" he said.Mr. Trump has said little about his audit's status. In March, his campaign released a letter to Mr. Trump from his lawyers, Sheri Dillon and William Nelson of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP. They wrote that the IRS concluded its audits for 2002 through 2008 and was working on remaining years.Through a spokesman, Ms. Dillon and Mr. Nelson, a former IRS chief counsel, declined to comment. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the audit is ""routine.""The letter from Mr. Trump's lawyers leaves open the possibility the IRS found problems or that he had accumulated tax losses, tax attorneys say.Mr. Trump is likely to become the first major-party presidential candidate since 1976 to release no tax returns. He has said he can't release them during an audit. No law stops him from doing so, though tax lawyers say public comments by tax experts on such released documents could give the IRS new ideas.The IRS typically has three years to finish an audit once a tax return is filed. The agency can ask a taxpayer to extend that period and the taxpayer typically agrees.The alternative is to give the IRS a deadline. That can prompt the agency to issue a ""notice of deficiency"" that may lead to a ""kitchen sink"" of potential added taxes, said Joshua Ungerman of Meadows, Collier, Reed, Cousins, Crouch & Ungerman LLP.Forcing the IRS to end an audit also narrows the taxpayer's options, because the only way then to contest the agency is in court, which would make the taxpayer's dispute public.Tax lawyers who reviewed the letter from Mr. Trump's attorneys said their description of the audits for 2002-2008 was phrased in a very specific way. The letter said the audits were ""closed administratively by agreement with the IRS without assessment or payment, on a net basis, of any deficiency.""The letter indicates Mr. Trump didn't write a check for any taxes owed. It doesn't rule out interest payments on back taxes owed, or the use of accumulated tax losses to cover any deficiency, the attorneys said.The letter seems to suggest the presence of losses, said Juan Vasquez, an attorney at Chamberlain Hrdlicka in Houston. Otherwise, he said, Mr. Trump's lawyers would have written that there was no deficiency without saying ""on a net basis.""Credit: By Richard Rubin",11/1/16
Trump Tries a Campaign Reboot,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809581463?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is trying to quickly reset his presidential campaign to address worsening poll numbers and growing isolation from influential members of the Republican Party.At weekend rallies, the GOP nominee read from a hand-held script and offered endorsements for the re-elections of a trio of Capitol Hill Republicans whom he had toyed with rebuffing. On Monday, he will head to Detroit to deliver an economic policy address that is expected to draw contrasts with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Many in Mr. Trump's party have been clamoring for weeks to see these kinds of adjustments. If he is to persuade Republican skeptics to buy back into his campaign, just weeks before the crucial post-Labor Day stage, the unorthodox, first-time candidate now must show he can make the changes stick.Part of the issue for the New York businessman is that he has run his campaign much like his family business, with his grown children as his top counselors and surrogates. That has meant he hasn't developed a strong connective tissue to party stalwarts and activists that can sustain a candidate through difficult times.Reports of Republicans leaving the party, lining up behind Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or even backing Mrs. Clinton gained momentum last week, after the nominee' criticized the parents of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq.""The friendly fire within the Republican Party over the last week has been extremely counterproductive,"" said veteran GOP strategist Dave Carney, who isn't involved in the Trump campaign but says he will vote for him. ""In modern presidential politics, this election is an outlier in terms of deterioration of support.""Mr. Trump hopes for a reboot with his Detroit speech, which will talk about ""the tepid economy under Obama and Clinton, versus the kind of growth economy that Mr. Trump wants to build,"" campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Sunday on Fox News.Mr. Trump in his speech is expected to give broad strokes about his economic plan, particularly to underscore his support for tax cuts. He is also likely to reiterate his plan to create a single top business tax rate that would apply to corporations and to businesses that pay taxes through their owners' individual returns.The candidate isn't likely to offer a detailed revision of his previously announced plan for big tax cuts. Advisers have been working on an overhaul of that plan to address criticism it would rapidly expand the federal deficit, but that revision isn't yet ready, advisers said.Mrs. Clinton will be in Florida on Monday and in Michigan on Thursday, talking about her economic plans.Mr. Trump has shown an ability to survive rough patches, and he and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have stressed party unity in recent days. At a rally in New Hampshire Saturday night, Mr. Trump largely stuck to lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton.Still, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, both of whom are facing election challenges, didn't appear on stage with their party's nominee during weekend rallies in their respective states. It was at Mr. Trump's appearance in Wisconsin Friday night that he announced his belated support for the re-election of those two lawmakers, and of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who faces a primary challenge this month.Robin Vos, the GOP speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, also skipped the Friday event in Green Bay because of Mr. Trump's reluctance to embrace Mr. Ryan's re-election and the positive comments the nominee made about Mr. Ryan's primary opponent.""There's this exasperation. We want to all rally; give us a reason,"" Mr. Vos said.If Mr. Trump continues to slide in national polls and surveys of battleground states -- the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Mrs. Clinton leading by 9 points -- more Republicans will be emboldened to declare their independence from the top of the ticket, GOP strategists and party leaders say.A new re-election ad by Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado vows to ""stand up"" to Mr. Trump. Scattered resignations from local parties could mean fewer grass-roots activists knocking on doors and working phone banks.""People would ask my opinion and they would say, 'How can you support this man?'"" said John Fielding, a former chairman of the Berks County, Pa., Republican Party, who recently resigned his post as a local GOP committeeman and switched his registration to independent. ""I didn't want to have to defend him.""One of the starkest signs of Mr. Trump's weakened support within the party came last week when his campaign circulated an appeal on Capitol Hill for an ""urgent pivot"" and asked members to write press releases and social media posts defending Mr. Trump's criticism of the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan, the Muslim U.S. soldier killed in Iraq in 2004 while protecting his unit.Only about half a dozen lawmakers publicly vouched for Mr. Trump, while numerous others chided him for questioning the Khan family's motives for appearing at the Democratic convention.Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, the Trump campaign's co-chairman on Capitol Hill, defended Mr. Trump over the Khan episode last week on Fox News. But he has stopped going to the weekly meetings with Trump officials, in part because he has been disappointed by the nominee's lack of personal outreach to his colleagues.""There's still a lot of reluctance among members to not just rally behind Trump but to also back up the campaign during moments of controversy,"" Mr. Hunter said in an email.Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Reid J.

Trump Gets It Wrong: Trade Is a Winner for Americans,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809566509?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump attacks the longstanding Republican promotion of trade as an engine of growth. The Republican presidential nominee asserts that trade produces winners and losers, that a country should always send more value abroad than it imports, and that America is thus a trade ""loser."" Whether he wins the election or not, Mr. Trump's protectionist views are forcing elected leaders -- especially in the Republican Party -- to decide whether to continue championing free trade or give up on opening markets.Wavering politicians should check their bearings by reviewing what voters think about trade. A July WSJ/NBC poll revealed that 55% of registered voters think free trade is good for America because it opens up markets for U.S. goods, while 38% consider it bad. A September 2015 Gallup poll found that only 18% of Americans said leaving the North American Free Trade Agreement would help the economy. Polls by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs in 2014 and 2015 found that Americans supported the negotiations for trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade by 62%-29% and 64%-29%, respectively. While other polls show more muddled results, at a minimum Republicans would be prudent not to assume voters will join Mr. Trump's retreat on trade.Mr. Trump's complaints are contradicted by the facts. The U.S. has free-trade agreements with 20 countries that account for 10% of the global economy. These deals are the basis for nearly half of America's exports. In the first five years after the U.S. has concluded free-trade agreements, U.S. exports have increased three times as rapidly as overall export growth. Over the past five years the U.S. has, with its free-trade partners, run a trade surplus for manufactured goods of about $230 billion, according to the Commerce Department. America's farmers and ranchers boosted their exports to free-trade partners by 130% between 2003-13, to $56 billion. One of every three acres of crops planted in America is for export.Mr. Trump's concentration on exports alone as ""winning"" ignores that U.S. businesses import to lower costs for American production. Over 60% of U.S. imports are intermediate goods that go into U.S. products.It would be foolhardy to force American businesses and consumers to pay more and have less freedom to choose. Lower taxes on imports from trade deals save the average U.S. household about $10,000 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Yet Mr. Trump wants to impose steep tariffs to ""win"" on trade.The presidency of Herbert Hoover, the last Republican in the White House to embrace high taxes on imports, offers a cautionary tale. After the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act's high tariffs took effect, Hoover achieved the trade surplus that Mr. Trump demands, but also an unemployment rate of 25% -- and the Great Depression.Americans account for only 4% of the world's population. Many potential customers live abroad. American exporters face tariffs that are, on average, four times the U.S. average, plus a host of nontariff barriers. The modern free-trade agreements that Mr. Trump dislikes have eliminated most traditional barriers while setting higher standards to protect U.S. intellectual property. They've also opened doors for U.S. service businesses and small- and medium-size enterprises, established new rules for e-commerce, and promoted anticorruption measures, transparency and environment and labor safeguards.U.S. multinational businesses pay their employees 25%-30% more than average wages, make about 57% of U.S. capital investment, and are the source of 83% of private R&D. At the same time, 98% of the 300,000 U.S. companies that export are small and medium-size enterprises, and they supply about one-third of America's exports.Moreover, those U.S. manufacturing workers whose jobs depend on exports earn on average 18% more than other workers. This wage premium reflects the higher productivity of business and workers who compete around the world. More than 11 million U.S. workers and one million farmers gain from this global competitive edge.Mr. Trump and other antitraders complain that American manufacturing has declined. Yet the U.S. share of global manufacturing has held at around 20% for 40 years. To compete, U.S. companies have had to boost productivity with new supply chains, technologies and products. As a result, workers have lost jobs. Every month, the U.S. economy creates, and loses, about five million jobs because of innovation, competition, changed consumer tastes -- and trade. Republicans should not abandon the world's most successful economic model because, according to Mr. Trump, Americans are ""losers.""Americans are not losers. But some Americans lose out because economic forces and misfortunes can overwhelm them. Whoever becomes the next president should help people adjust to change, not pretend that change can be prevented. Policy makers should advance ideas to get people back into jobs, assist with their relocation, supplement earned incomes, cut taxes on wages and make useful training and skills upgrades part of ongoing support for economic security.Mr. Trump indulges in the real loser's game: Always find someone else to blame. The U.S. became the most successful country in the world because Americans confronted their challenges. When Republican leaders consider their future agenda, they should reject Donald Trump's losing litany of protectionist ideas and keep opening markets for trade.---Mr. Zoellick is a former World Bank president, U.S. trade representative and deputy secretary of state.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Promoting Trade Without Competitiveness"" -- WSJ Aug. 17, 2016)Credit: By Robert B.

"Election 2016: Economy Buffets Clinton, Trump Claims -- Mixed reports could undercut arguments by each candidate on state of the rebound",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807848511?accountid=12768,"The U.S. economy is flashing mixed signals heading toward November's election, complicating the narrative for both presidential campaigns in a race featuring sharply different views of the vitality of the seven-year expansion.Presidential elections often hinge on popular perceptions of the economy's health, particularly those that solidify in the early summer of an election year. That puts a premium on economic gauges in June and July, be it on overall output, the pace of hiring or measures of consumer sentiment.New figures out Friday showed U.S. gross domestic product, a broad measure of output, averaged a paltry 1% seasonally adjusted annual growth rate through the year's first half, well below historical norms. That has raised fears the economy is slowing heading into the election.That would add a new headwind for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as she tries to fend off Republican contender Donald Trump, since her campaign in part is based on praising the success fellow Democrat President Barack Obama has had in rejuvenating the economy since 2009. Research shows voters can take a dimmer view of incumbent parties when the economy is underperforming.At the same time, other important measures, on jobs, wages, consumer spending and consumer confidence, suggest a degree of resilience for the seven-year expansion, undercutting Mr. Trump's portrayal of an economy in dismal shape.Economic ups and downs almost always play into presidential campaigns, as they did in 2012, when steady hiring aided Mr. Obama.In the past three elections comparable to this one, in which a two-term president was stepping down -- 1988, 2000 and 2008 -- the state of the economy played a key role, but in unpredictable ways.In 1988, George H.W. Bush won his first term, and the Republican Party's third consecutive term, in the White House. The economy, in the fifth year of a robust expansion, certainly helped. GDP, for example, advanced at a 3.9% pace during that year's first half, faster than the post-World War II average of about 3.2%. The labor market also was expanding at a solid clip.By mid-1988, consumer spending had climbed 8% from a year earlier. (Currently it is up less than 4%.) The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed confidence on the rise.In 2000, a vibrant economy failed to propel Al Gore into the White House, which would have been a third straight term for Democrats.At the midpoint of 2000, GDP was averaging a 4.5% growth rate, the labor market had added close to three million jobs over the previous year, consumer spending was up 7.7% and consumer sentiment was coming off a record high.Republican George W. Bush won the contested election by a whisker after a Supreme Court case over Florida vote counting was decided in his favor.In mid-2008, the housing market was collapsing, Lehman Brothers was on the brink of bankruptcy and the economy was months into a deep recession. GDP contracted and the labor market shed jobs. While consumers continued to spend, confidence was in free fall. Mr. Obama defeated Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who was seeking to succeed his fellow Republican, Mr. Bush.How does the economy look now? The biggest mark against it is found in the broadest measure of growth. The meager first half GDP growth rate resulted in part because of a pullback in investment by companies, a drawdown in business inventories and slower government spending.The labor market has been performing well, though not as well as the 1988 and 2000 cycles. Nonfarm payrolls are up by about 2.5 million over the past year, while the unemployment rate in June was 4.9%, compared with 5.4% in 1988, 4% in 2000 and 5.6% in 2008.Consumers are offering a key support for the economy, with their spending up 3.7% from a year earlier. Consumer confidence is roughly in line with 1988 but well short of 2000 levels.""The economy in terms of the growth rate of GDP is clearly not a plus for the Democrats in 2016,"" said Ray Fair, a Yale University professor who has written extensively on the economy's impact on elections. Tepid output combined with the electorate's tendency to vote out a two-term incumbent party work against Mrs. Clinton, he said.Still, Mr. Fair said, 2016 is an unusual election and Mr. Trump an atypical candidate for the Republican Party.Credit: By Jeffrey Sparshott",11/1/16
Father in Rift With Trump Volleys Back,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807848487?accountid=12768,"The father of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed saving his troops from a suicide bomber said he isn't a proxy for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign despite taking swipes at Donald Trump in a Democratic convention speech that has spurred a tense exchange with the GOP nominee.Khizr Khan, who said in an interview Sunday that he would happily speak before Republican groups if asked, was hardly known before several days ago. But the flare-up with Mr. Trump dominated campaign coverage over the weekend. During the convention appearance last week with his wife, Ghazala, Mr. Khan criticized Mr. Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., brandishing a pocket copy of the Constitution and questioning whether Mr. Trump had ever read the document.That appearance provoked a response from Mr. Trump, who bristled at Mr. Khan's contention that he had never had to sacrifice anything, and he wondered why Mrs. Khan was ""extremely quiet"" onstage.In an interview, Mr. Khan described himself as a political independent and said he is gratified that prominent Republicans have defended him in the exchange with Mr. Trump. He mentioned supportive statements on Sunday from House Speaker Paul Ryan and from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, and added, ""If Republicans invite me [to speak at an event] I have no problem at all. I'll go and speak.""Mr. Khan's speech Thursday night touched off a turbulent debate that has spread with viral speed online and was a rare moment when an ordinary American speaking about his personal experiences in the context of the political times can break through. An attorney, Mr. Khan's indictment of Mr. Trump and his proposed temporary ban on Muslims from entering the U.S. has become a powerful argument for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, even as he said his role in the campaign wasn't designed to be partisan.He added in the interview, ""I'm not a registered Democrat or Republican. I vote for whoever I feel.""But Mr. Khan made clear that, to him, Mr. Trump is an unacceptable choice for president, saying the GOP candidate's family needs to ""sit him down and teach him empathy.""Responding to Mr. Khan's contention in the speech that Mr. Trump had ""sacrificed nothing and no one,"" Mr. Trump, on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday, cited the ""thousands and thousands of jobs"" he created as examples of his sacrifice. He then ignited another furor by saying Mrs. Khan perhaps ""wasn't allowed to have anything to say"" onstage at the convention.Mr. Khan chafed at that remark. He said in the interview that his wife played an active role in editing his speech and reiterated that Mr. Trump is showing no compassion. ""He says my wife is not allowed to talk because of our religion,"" said Mr. Khan, 66 years old. ""Now who is attacking whom?""As criticism toward Mr. Trump built over the weekend, he issued a statement calling the Khans' son, Capt. Humayun Khan, a ""hero"" and saying the ""real problem"" is ""the radical Islamic terrorists."" He said on Twitter Sunday morning that he had been ""viciously attacked"" by Mr. Khan and suggested he had to respond.""While I feel deeply for the loss of his son, Mr. Khan who has never met me, has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution, (which is false) and say many other inaccurate things,"" Mr. Trump said in the statement.Mrs. Khan responded to Mr. Trump in the Washington Post on Sunday, writing that her grief makes it impossible to walk into rooms with pictures of her son, and that she couldn't compose herself enough to speak in the Democratic convention hall where a large photo of Capt. Khan was displayed.""Without saying a thing, all the world, all America, felt my pain,"" she wrote. ""I am a Gold Star mother. Whoever saw me felt me in their heart.""In Ohio Sunday, Mrs. Clinton went after Mr. Trump. ""He has throughout the course of his campaign consistently insulted and demeaned individuals, groups of Americans, people around the world. And one doesn't know where the bottom is,"" Mrs. Clinton said in a campaign stop in Ashland.From an early point in their convention planning, Clinton campaign officials knew they wanted Mr. Khan to be one of the featured speakers, a person close to the matter said. The campaign was familiar with the Khans and their family's tragedy. Capt. Khan, one of their three sons, was killed in a car-bomb explosion in Iraq in 2004.Mrs. Clinton had given a speech in Minneapolis in December 2015 devoted to national security, and toward the end she spoke about Capt. Khan's death, drawing from an interview with the father that appeared a week earlier on the website Vocativ.That speech by Mrs. Clinton came shortly after Mr. Trump had proposed his ban on Muslims, and the Clinton campaign believed Mr. Khan's story of his son's sacrifice would reinforce the campaign's message on religious and racial tolerance. Campaign officials invited him to take a prime speaking slot at the convention.Mr. Khan said the Clinton campaign hasn't asked him to be any sort of surrogate on the campaign trail. If asked, though, he said he would be willing to appear at Clinton events if his schedule permitted.Born in Pakistan, Mr. Khan studied law in that country before moving to Dubai in the mid-1970s. He said he came to the U.S. in 1980 and became a citizen six years later. He and his wife now live in Charlottesville, Va., where he works as a consultant on legal cases.""Folks who are planning to vote for Donald Trump, I would ask them to reconsider,"" Mr. Khan said in the interview. ""It will be a moral burden on them because of the policies he said he's going to implement.""---Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.Credit: By Peter Nicholas and Richard Rubin",11/1/16
Trump's Jobs Claim Unlikely Due to Demographic Change,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1834686756?accountid=12768,"Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro assert that ""A Vote for Trump Is a Vote for Growth"" (op-ed, Oct. 25) and that 25 million new jobs would be created during a Donald Trump presidency.Unfortunately, this figure doesn't align with the demographic reality. During the 1980s, the working-age population (Americans ages 20-64) expanded by 18.5 million (130 million to 148.5) and 16.1 million jobs were created during the Reagan presidency. During the 1990s, the working-age population grew by 19.1 million (148.5 million to 167.6) and 22.5 million jobs were created during the Bill Clinton presidency. If it represents net new jobs, the 25 million target in eight years is extremely unlikely, given estimates that the working-age population will only grow by 2.6 million in the decade to 2025 (192.5 million to 195.1) (population data compiled from U.N. estimates).Sami J.

"We Really Are Losing Sleep Over the Election; Measurements from Fitbit, Jawbone and Withings show statistically significant changes on nights Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debated",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1834420625?accountid=12768,"Wearable devices that track exercise and other vital signs reveal what many have suspected: The election is making us lose sleep.The night of the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Sept. 26, Fitbit users nationwide slept an average of 4.2 minutes less than they did the Monday before and the Monday after the debate. Users' average sleep typically varies only about one to two minutes from one Monday to the next, so the change on the debate night is statistically significant, according to San Francisco-based Fitbit.The numbers are based on average sleep data from 10 million Fitbit users nationwide. The company gets its data when users sync their trackers wirelessly to mobile devices or computers through an app that displays their personal stats. Fitbit aggregates users' data and removes identifying information before analyzing the data.The debate-night effect was most pronounced for those in the Eastern time zone, with people in Indiana, Florida, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. sleeping at least 10 minutes less on the first-debate night than usual.But it also appeared in states where the first debate ended hours before a typical bedtime: Californians and Texans both slept at least five minutes less than usual.""Is it going to have a meaningful effect on your cognitive performance the next day? Probably not,"" says Shelten Yuen, Fitbit vice president of research. But, he adds, ""some people are more affected than others.""A record 84 million viewers watched the first debate , roughly one-third of the U.S. adult population. The debate was second only to the Super Bowl's 112 million viewers as the most-watched program of 2016. The second and third presidential debates and the vice presidential debate also rank in the top seven most-viewed programs this year.February's Super Bowl had an even greater effect on sleep, with Fitbit users getting eight minutes less nationwide that night. It's difficult to say whether viewers of the game and the first debate slept less because they were agitated, excited or merely distracted. The Super Bowl game and the debate ended by 10:45 p.m. ET, well before the average bedtime for Fitbit users of 11:44 p.m.Data from two other wearables companies also show users losing statistically significant amounts of sleep for the first debate and others.Users of Withings, the digital-health arm of Nokia Technologies, slept nearly five minutes less on the night of the first presidential debate and on the night of the vice presidential debate than they did on the same nights a week earlier. Users slept nearly nine minutes less the night of the final presidential debate. The data come from 13,000 to 15,000 users of Withings activity trackers or connected alarm clocks.Jawbone says its users slept five minutes less on the nights of the first and second presidential debates than they did on the same nights a year earlier. Users slept three minutes less the night of the vice presidential debate. The findings were based on data from more than 100,000 users of Jawbone's UP wearable devices in all 50 states, a Jawbone spokesman says. Withings and Jawbone also say they aggregate data and remove identifying details before analyzing it.Owners of wearable devices tend to be slightly younger and significantly wealthier than likely voters. More than 40% of activity-tracker owners have household incomes above $100,000, says Weston Henderek, director of connected intelligence for market-research firm NPD Group Inc.More than half of U.S. adults say the election is a very or somewhat significant source of stress , according to a recent Harris Poll done on behalf of the American Psychological Association. Registered Democrats (55%) and Republicans (59%) were nearly as likely to say the election is a source of stress. Stress is a common cause of sleep loss .The poll of about 3,500 adults was done online in August. The full results won't be released until next year, but the APA released a subset of data in October because it was so timely, says Vaile Wright, director of research and special projects at the Washington, D.C.-based APA.The percentage of adults reporting stress over the election is similar to the share that reported stress about the economy during the depths of the recession of 2007 to 2009, Dr. Wright says. People who use social media were more likely to say this election is a source of stress.""It's like there's this running tape of worries in somebody's head and they have a hard time turning it off, which results in difficulty falling asleep and also staying asleep,"" Dr. Wright says.Skipping the final debate on Oct. 19 didn't keep Lisa Bohn, a 42-year-old mother of two in Jonesboro, Ark., from ruminating. After her 6-year-old son woke her up in the wee hours, she scrolled through postdebate chatter on her Facebook feed.""I was up for another hour because I couldn't shut my brain off,"" says Ms. Bohn, an assistant professor of theater at Arkansas State University. ""It was just sort of gnawing at me.""Philip Muskin, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, estimates about one-third of his patients mention the election. Some tell him it's affecting their sleep. His female patients especially say they are upset about Mr. Trump's treatment of women.Dr. Muskin tells patients to limit their exposure to news and social media rather than taking sleeping pills.""If you're going to sleep at 11:30 p.m., by 10 o'clock you should turn that stuff off and stop getting that kind of stimulation,"" he says. He also teaches patients breathing techniques to use for 10 to 15 minutes before going to bed.Yik Yak, a smartphone app that lets people create and view discussion threads within a small area such as a college campus, in October polled 5,000 users, the vast majority of them in their late teens to early 20s. About 89% said they're losing sleep over the election, says Hilary McQuaide, Yik Yak's director of communications.Of those who said they lost sleep, 73% are concerned about the election's aftermath.Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com and Sumtahi Reddy at Sumathi.Reddy@wsj.comCredit: By Rachel Bachman and Sumathi Reddy",11/2/16
Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Trump's Challenge: Passing Plausibility Test,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807986313?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsCalifornia is the nation's most populous state. The Aug. 2 Capital Journal column called it the largest state, without specifying that it was largest by population, not area.(WSJ August 16, 2016)With both parties spinning out of their conventions, and the general-election campaign now essentially in full swing, one megaquestion hovers over the whole affair: Will enough Americans get comfortable with the idea of Donald Trump as president?If they do, the presidential race likely will be a close one -- and one he could well win. Mr. Trump does, after all, have two enormous assets: He is seen as the agent of change in a year in which change is desired, and he is thought to be better able to handle the economy. If you want to score well on two fronts this year, those are the ones you want.On the other hand, if Americans can't see a man so brash, unpredictable and, to some, downright scary as their president, Mr. Trump would hit a ceiling at some point and won't be able to rise further. Hillary Clinton would win.Both campaigns essentially acknowledge that this is the question of the fall. Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign manager, spoke about it openly during the Republican convention in Cleveland.Mr. Manafort is a veteran who has seen just about all there is to see in politics. He compares this election to the 1980 race when Ronald Reagan, for whom he worked, won as an outsider. In that race, many Americans had a hard time embracing the former actor, derided by some as intellectually unfit and too dangerous on national security, as a potential president.But Americans were fed up with a status quo that had produced rampant inflation, gas lines and humiliation at the hands of Iranian students holding American diplomats hostage in Tehran. They wanted change; the question was whether they could find Mr. Reagan a safe choice as change agent.It took many voters until the last presidential debate, just a week before the election, to decide Mr. Reagan was a plausible president. When they did, the election swung his way decisively.""So just like with Reagan, I believe that once Donald Trump is accepted by the American people as somebody who can be president, I think the race is over,"" Mr. Manafort said at a Bloomberg breakfast last week. ""When that will be, I don't know. We've got to do our job.""But it's far from clear that the Reagan parallel holds up. For starters, Mr. Reagan was by 1980 a seasoned politician with significant government experience. He had been governor of California, the nation's largest state, for eight years, and had run a full-bore presidential campaign once before, in 1976.In other words, he wasn't quite the risky outside option that Mr. Trump presents this year. He was a maverick, but one with more experience and with whom voters had more time to get comfortable.There's also this difference: Mr. Reagan was well-liked personally. Negative feelings toward Mr. Trump personally have been well chronicled by this point, of course. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, for example, 60% of those surveyed held negative feelings about Mr. Trump personally, while just 27% had positive ones.By contrast, the Gallup organization earlier this year researched feelings toward Mr. Reagan during the 1980 campaign and found the opposite: ""In general, these data show that Reagan enjoyed mostly positive net favorable reviews throughout 1980,"" Gallup found.In a Gallup poll in January 1980, for example, Mr. Reagan had a 60% favorable rating. And on Gallup's 10-point scale of measuring personal favorability, 70% of Americans viewed him positively that May and that August.Mrs. Clinton's campaign knows she confronts her own formidable challenges on the likability and trustworthiness front, of course.But while the Clinton camp wants to make people comfortable with the idea of her as president -- which explains the many convention testimonials to her reliability as well as the highly personal presentations by her husband and daughter -- the Democrats are at least as intent on making sure the idea of a Trump presidency doesn't settle in comfortably with swing voters. In fact, they want the vision to be seen as a frightening one.""He loses his cool at the slightest provocation,"" Mrs. Clinton argued in her acceptance speech last week in Philadelphia. ""When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.""She even reached back to the Reagan precedent, but in a quite different way. Referring to Mr. Reagan's trademark upbeat motto, she said Mr. Trump has ""taken the Republican Party a long way, from 'morning in America' to midnight in America.""There is a lot of ground to cover in the next three months. Yet the first and maybe final issue is the most basic one: Will Mr. Trump pass the plausibility test?Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",11/2/16
Election 2016: Koch Donors Not in a Giving Mood for Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807981693?accountid=12768,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- Some of the Republican Party's wealthiest donors on Sunday sipped Manhattans in a lakeside bar and tried not to talk about Donald Trump.About 400 donors gathered at a resort here over the weekend for the biannual meeting of the network backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch. The Kochs have publicly criticized Mr. Trump and say the network won't spend money on his behalf, though Charles Koch made clear Sunday he wouldn't back Democrat Hillary Clinton either.Not all of the network's donors clustered at the Bar Del Lago agreed. Some had come to press Mr. Koch to support Mr. Trump, saying Mrs. Clinton would be a far worse option. Other donors praised the network's neutral stance, saying they saw no other option among the current candidates.The event's organizers invited a handful of reporters to attend on condition they not identify donors without their consent. The Wall Street Journal agreed to the arrangement.""I'm voting for the Republican nominee,"" said Edwin Meese, a former U.S. attorney general who is now a top official at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Asked why he supported the businessman, Mr. Meese replied: ""The main thing is, he's the Republican nominee.""Tim Busch, CEO of a California-based hotel chain, said he planned to vote for Mr. Trump due to his stance on abortion rights, but said he wouldn't ""publicly support him."" Mr. Busch, who donated the maximum $75,800 to GOP nominee Mitt Romney's joint fund with the Republican National Committee and another $5,000 to Mr. Romney's campaign in 2012, said he won't give to the Trump campaign.The Koch network, which spent $400 million in 2012 on top of the millions its donors gave to Mr. Romney, faces the task this year of remaining relevant while staying out of one of the most contentious elections of recent times.It also means the 1,600 staffers the network has amassed across 38 states -- a grass-roots force that the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee sorely need -- will instead be devoted to down-ballot races, where the network plans to spend between $250 and $280 million.The network appears roughly split between donors who are backing Mr. Trump and those who, like the Kochs, are sitting this one out.But even donors who say they will vote for Mr. Trump in November appear reluctant to give to his campaign. That means Mr. Trump will have to escalate his fundraising without the help of some of his party's most generous donors. The businessman already faces a sizable fundraising deficit compared with Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Trump, who has accused his campaign opponents of being puppets to their donors, has sought to turn his fundraising disadvantage into a strength by saying he will be free of such ties if elected -- an argument many voters have said is a key draw for them.In a private meeting this weekend, Mr. Koch and network officials laid out the reasoning behind the decision not to support Mr. Trump, saying spending on the presidential race would ""dilute"" their congressional efforts, said media billionaire Stan Hubbard.Some donors in recent months have sought to persuade Mr. Trump to meet with Charles Koch, in hopes he could help shape some of the candidate's policies.Doug Deason, son of tech billionaire Darwin Deason, is among those lobbying Mr. Koch to meet with the candidate, calling Mr. Trump a ""raw piece of ore that needs to be molded into something."" Mr. Koch hasn't agreed to meet with Mr. Trump.The businessman tweeted Saturday he had ""turned down"" a meeting with the Kochs, saying, ""Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!""Network officials said they weren't aware of any contact between their group and Mr. Trump when he was in Colorado Springs Friday. ""I don't think a meeting offer was extended,"" Mr. Deason said.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Libertarian Ticket Deserves More Conservatives' Support"" -- WSJ Sept. 1, 2016)Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",11/2/16
The Donald J. Trump Referendum,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807981653?accountid=12768,"With the party conventions wrapped up, the contours of the final 100 days of the general election are becoming clearer. The country wants change, which should help Republicans. But Democrats are confident that Hillary Clinton will win if they can make the election about Donald Trump, and Mr. Trump seems happy to oblige.Democrats revealed in Philadelphia that they've decided not to make the campaign a typical left-right ideological battle. Instead, they will try to disqualify Mr. Trump as temperamentally and morally unfit for the Presidency. From now until November, expect to hear a lot about three-a.m. phone calls and nuclear winter -- and on the occasional lighter note, Mr. Trump's well-documented vulgarity.President Obama put this strategy crisply when he noted that ""what we heard in Cleveland last week wasn't particularly Republican -- and it sure wasn't conservative."" For eight years the worst thing Mr. Obama could say about somebody is that he's a Republican. So calling Mr. Trump worse than a conservative Republican is, for him, really harsh.The public desire for change is nonetheless real and growing, and Democrats know that Mrs. Clinton is the least convincing ""change maker"" in American politics, to quote her husband's phrase. But they have built formidable money and organizational advantages, and they figure they can win with even a candidate as flawed as Mrs. Clinton as long as 2016 is a referendum on Mr. Trump, not on the Clinton-Obama agenda or the last eight years.Meanwhile, Donald Trump seems thrilled that Democrats are trying to make the election about his favorite subject -- Donald J. Trump. Were he as shrewd a politician as he claims to be a businessman, he'd explain how Clinton-Obama policies have failed and why his would be superior. Above all, he'd work overtime to reassure undecided voters that he is a risk worth taking. He can't tap into dissatisfaction with the status quo if Americans can't imagine him sitting in the Oval Office.But that's not the Trump way, and he can't seem to help himself. The New Yorker is as easy to read as the giant Trump signs he puts on his buildings, and Democrats have figured out they can bait him into self-destructive behavior.Mr. Trump is so thin-skinned that he can't let any criticism pass without lashing back in ad hominem fashion. Thus Mr. Trump has spent the last three days trading insults with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son was an Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004; Mr. Khan spoke against Mr. Trump at the Democratic convention. Mr. Trump could have shown statesmanship and made an expression of sympathy and gratitude for the Khans' sacrifice. If he had to make a political point, he could have mentioned that Mrs. Clinton voted for the Iraq war and then turned against it when the going got rough.Instead, Mr. Trump made himself look small and hurt his own claim to be Commander in Chief. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan were compelled to issue statements distancing themselves from Mr. Trump by commending Humayun Khan's service to the nation. John McCain was even blunter. Memo to Trump Tower: Hillary Clinton isn't trying to rebut Patricia Smith, who blamed the Democrat at the GOP convention for her son's death at the U.S. mission in Benghazi.Mrs. Clinton's other advantage is that Mr. Trump knows little about the world and can't be bothered to learn. In an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on the weekend, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that Russian proxies had not invaded Crimea. ""He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down,"" Mr. Trump blustered. Last week he floated the prospect of officially recognizing Russia's annexation.A two-page briefing document could have acquainted Mr. Trump with the Crimean reality, but that would have required doing a high schooler's amount of homework. Maybe it could have even instructed him that a Republican who wants to win an election can't let a Democrat look more hawkish toward U.S. adversaries like Vladimir Putin.Mr. Trump's indiscipline managed to drown out Friday's dismal economic report and another burst of Clinton dissembling about the classified material on her private email server. In rookie candidate school, they'd called this political malpractice.Mrs. Clinton appears to be getting a bounce from her convention and by next week may have solidified her lead in the polls. She and Democrats must be amazed that they're drawn an opponent who so easily plays into their hands.",11/2/16
Main Street: Trump on Offense,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1807981572?accountid=12768,"For Donald Trump's critics, it's not just that they disagree with the man and his policies. It's more that they find him offensive.There's a reason for this: Mr. Trump is a man who is perpetually on offense.Think of him as the Kevin Kelley of politics. Mr. Kelley coaches football for Pulaski Academy in Little Rock, Ark. He's gained national fame as the coach who almost never punts. Coach Kelley believes that remaining on offense (keeping possession of the ball) is more important than defense (trying to deny an opponent field position).So he goes for it on fourth down even in his own territory. As a result, Mr. Kelley gives his offense four plays to gain 10 yards instead of three. Just as important, his all-offense approach gives his Bruins a psychological edge.The strategy is not without its risks. Though Mr. Kelley says the math bears him out, his approach means opponents will sometimes score or intercept when they might not have otherwise. Backfires can be messy.Mr. Trump is playing the same game. Not only is he always on the attack, he hardly ever backs down -- even when he's demonstrably wrong. The result has been a number of busted plays, whether it's declaring that John McCain was not a hero because he was captured by the North Vietnamese, questioning the impartiality of an Indiana-born federal judge because the jurist has Mexican blood or his campaign team's initial denials that Melania Trump had cribbed some lines in her convention speech from Michelle Obama when the theft was clear and obvious.Mr. Trump's critics are quick to suggest these kind of things make him unfit for the Oval Office. Especially on the right, they frequently go on to add that any Republican or conservative who does not publicly pronounce him anathema will forever bear the mark of Cain.It should be noted that his critics on the right are also invested in a big GOP defeat. If Mr. Trump loses by two or three points, they will be blamed for contributing to that defeat. If, by contrast, Mr. Trump loses by a landslide, they will look like prophets.For the larger Republican Party, however, there's a catch. If it turns out Mr. Trump loses by a narrow margin, Republican senators and congressmen still have a chance of keeping their seats. A blowout defeat for Mr. Trump, on the other hand, would likely translate into massive Republican losses in both the Senate and House. Even so, it's a price the NeverTrump movement appears more than willing to pay to make their point.Hillary Clinton's dilemma is somewhat different. And it points to the great X Factor of the 2016 election: Never before have Democrats faced a Republican nominee who is so relentlessly on offense.They haven't quite figured out how best to respond. At their convention in Philly, Democrats tried presenting the repellent Mr. Trump as a break from all those decent Republicans of the past.Hmmm. Anyone remember election year 2000, when the NAACP ran an ad implying George W. Bush was OK with lynching? It exploited the brutal murder of an African-American in Texas who had been beaten, chained to the back of a pickup truck, and then dragged through the streets. In a voice-over, the murdered man's daughter says, ""So when Governor George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.""Where were the keepers of public respectability then, warning that anyone who didn't immediately renounce the NAACP for this smear would be forever tainted?And while we're on the subject of smears directed at Sen. McCain, in the 2008 campaign Georgia Rep. John Lewis said the tone of the McCain/Palin campaign reminded him of ""another destructive period in American history."" Just to underscore his point, Mr. Lewis noted that while ""George Wallace never threw a bomb"" or ""fired a gun,"" he created the ""atmosphere of hate"" that led to the murder of those innocent girls.Again, hard to recall an ongoing chorus of disapproval, much less the suggestion that Mr. Lewis and his followers had forever fouled themselves.Likewise the attacks on Mitt Romney. In 2012 Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid falsely accused Mr. Romney of failing to pay his taxes; the deputy manager of the Obama campaign suggested he was a felon; and a pro-Obama super PAC ran an ad blaming Mr. Romney for the cancer death of a woman whose husband's steel plant had been shut down in a Bain Capital restructuring years earlier.The truth is that Mr. Trump's offense is in good part a creature of the campaigns Democrats have run against Republicans for decades. Sooner or later it was inevitable that voters, tired of both political correctness and playing defense, would opt for a Republican nominee who would give as ugly as he got.Unlike Mr. Kelley, who has a string of state championships and an impressive win-loss record, Mr. Trump has not yet proved his strategy will put him over the goal line come the fall. But he's sure taken Coach Kelley's point about offense.Credit: By William McGurn",11/2/16

Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Separating Donald Trump From Trumpism,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809923302?accountid=12768,"This is a good time to remember that there is Trump, and there is Trumpism. They aren't the same, and their fates aren't necessarily linked.Trump is, of course, Donald Trump, Republican presidential nominee. And he is in some trouble. He spent last week being even more of a controversy magnet than usual, alienating some key figures within his own party, falling further behind Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls and leading some to wonder whether he is fatally flawed as a candidate.Then there is Trumpism -- the mixture of attitudes and positions that catapulted its namesake to the Republican nomination in the first place. Trumpism is a populist mix of anger at the status quo, skepticism about the virtues of free trade and immigration, doubts about the need for U.S. intervention abroad, fondness for law and order and a dose of nationalism. ""Americanization, not globalization, will be our new credo,"" Mr. Trump put it in a speech in Detroit on Monday.Donald Trump didn't create these attitudes. He tapped into them. There is every reason to believe that, even if he fails this year, they will have a life of their own going forward. That is something both parties would do well to keep in mind.The appeal of Trumpism can be seen in data from a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll completed last week, in the midst of Mr. Trump's fight with the family of a Muslim U.S. soldier killed in Iraq who spoke at the Democratic convention and his feud with top figures of his own party. Even as his own standing was sliding, including with his core audience of white working-class voters, his core message continued to resonate.When voters were asked whether Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton would be better at changing business as usual in Washington, Mr. Trump prevailed in a runaway, by 48% to 26%. That is a powerful sentiment in an antiestablishment year.Despite a lack of specifics in his economic plans -- something Mr. Trump started to address with a fairly conventional economics speech and backup supporting materials Monday -- he retained an advantage over Mrs. Clinton as the candidate best able to deal with the economy, though his lead in that category has shrunk. And he enjoyed a 44% to 36% advantage on who could best deal with crime.Perhaps most telling, the poll tested voter reactions to core messages that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton each delivered in their convention acceptance speeches -- without saying which candidate delivered them.Mr. Trump's core message in the poll talked of ""a moment of crisis for our nation"" and said attacks on police and terrorism ""threaten our very way of life."" Mrs. Clinton's core statement was less dark, saying ""do not let anyone tell you that our country is weak . . . Do not let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do.""By a 52% to 36% ratio, more voters said the Trump statement described what they are thinking ""very well.""Even on the personal problems that plagued each candidate last week -- Mr. Trump's fight with the family of the fallen Muslim soldier and Mrs. Clinton's continued wrestling with her use of a private email server while secretary of state -- concerns about the two candidates were about even.So the Trump message retains power, even if the messenger is flawed. ""There is a Trump campaign lurking in this data,"" said GOP pollster Bill McInturff, who conducts the Journal/NBC News poll with Democrat Fred Yang. He added: ""If Donald Trump were capable of running the campaign that sits here waiting for him in this data, there is a capacity to close this gap"" with Mrs. Clinton.It isn't clear that's possible. Doubts about the Trump temperament aren't abating, nor are deep concerns about his knowledge and experience. These are critical problems.But they also distract from the fact that Mr. Trump put his finger on a public attitude of some significance. Whether he actually sensed it or simply stumbled onto it doesn't really matter. Somebody was bound to come along to crystallize it, because it has been building for years.Its roots go at least as far back as the insurgent candidacies of Ross Perot and Patrick Buchanan in the 1990s, maybe to George Wallace's run in 1968. Eight years ago, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty warned his party that it was missing the rise of working-class ""Sam's Club Republicans"" with more populist economic views.Three years ago, after off-year elections, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat, warned of the emergence of a radicalized center looking for a pragmatic problem-solver not associated with a dysfunctional Washington.Now Trump forces, having entered the arena, aren't likely to simply exit quietly. If Mr. Trump wins, they will be empowered. If their standard-bearer fails, Republicans will have to learn to deal with an unhappy, establishment-hating army within. Eventually, Democrats may have to as well.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",11/3/16
Trump on the Economy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809922801?accountid=12768,"Is it possible that his post-convention plunge in the polls has scared Donald Trump straight? Probably not, but it is progress that the Republican presidential nominee has decided to join the debate over how to increase U.S. growth and incomes.The plan Mr. Trump laid out at the Detroit Economic Club on Monday is his most detailed so far and marks a step forward on regulation, taxes and energy. He pitched his program as a path out of the slow-growth status quo, which is a debate the country needs and is an issue on which the polls show Mr. Trump has credibility with voters.Mr. Trump's biggest news was a proposal for a tax cut aimed at kick-starting the slow business investment that is hobbling growth. He'd cut the corporate income-tax rate to 15%, from the current uncompetitive 35%, and he'd also do the same for so-called pass-through businesses that pay taxes at the individual rate of 39.6% (closer to 44% if you include the Obama bells and whistles).At a stroke the 15% rate would make the U.S. competitive again with the rest of the industrialized world, and even with Ireland, Singapore and the United Kingdom as a destination for capital. The 15% rate is low enough to end the tax incentive for companies to move their headquarters overseas -- so-called inversions.Mr. Trump also proposed a 10% special tax rate if companies repatriate the $2 trillion they have previously earned overseas. If half that amount came back, the feds would take in $100 billion in new revenue at a 10% rate. That's better than 35% of zero.Business investment has lagged for most of this seven-year recovery and it has subtracted from GDP the past nine months. This often occurs in the later stages of economic expansions, and Mr. Trump's business tax cut is thus a form of recession insurance.Mr. Trump said he is paring back his individual income-tax proposal, no doubt to improve the fiscal math. Last year he proposed four tax brackets with a top rate of 25%, and he's changing that to 12%, 25% and 33%. That's higher than we'd prefer, but those are the same three rates that House Republicans have proposed. If Mr. Trump is listening to the people he'd have to work with next year, that's progress.Mr. Trump also contradicted himself by proposing a new tax deduction for child care even as he promised a simpler tax code. This sounds like the Ivanka Trump deduction, after her plea to help working mothers at the GOP convention. Democrats are already saying the proposal won't help women who don't pay taxes, so it isn't even clear how much political benefit Mr. Trump will get from the idea.Mr. Trump didn't reveal many other details, which he said will come later. In particular he'll have to be more specific about the deductions he would be willing to give up to finance his tax cut. The Tax Foundation scored his original plan at a revenue loss of $10 trillion over 10 years, and Mr. Trump's advisers say he is trying to get it closer to $3 trillion.Critics say this is still too large, but that is over 10 years when the feds would rake in more than $40 trillion in revenue. Faster growth would make up some of that $3 trillion. By contrast, Hillary Clinton wants trillions in new spending financed by $1.3 trillion in tax increases that would reduce growth and yield less tax revenue.The Republican proposed a moratorium on regulation and easing barriers to domestic energy production. These are both good ideas, and he'll need them because as always Mr. Trump's economic agenda includes the poison pill of trade protectionism.Mr. Trump believes that a trade deficit equals lost American jobs, when there is no such connection. The U.S. tends to run bigger trade deficits when the economy is strong, and vice versa. By that logic the fastest way to cut the trade deficit is to have a recession, but that would only cost more jobs.Raising taxes at the border -- aka tariffs -- wouldn't keep jobs in the U.S. but would reduce the standard of living for U.S. consumers. His promise to punish U.S. companies for investing overseas could end up costing more jobs if it caused companies to relocate more of their operations overseas to avoid the punishment. Global supply chains are crucial to preserving U.S. manufacturing jobs.The question with Mr. Trump is how much his trade agenda would interfere with his pro-growth domestic policies. If Republicans in Congress blocked his worst trade instincts, the damage could be small. If he used executive powers to wage a trade war, look out. With the mercurial New Yorker, you never know.Which is the same doubt that applies to his overall candidacy. One economic speech won't persuade Americans who have doubts about President Trump. To revive his campaign, he'll need to carry the economic growth theme every day from here to November.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Mr. Trump Makes Some Good Points on Trade"" -- WSJ Aug. 15, 2016)",11/3/16
"Trump, Clinton Spar on Economy",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1809922198?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump blasted Hillary Clinton in an economic-policy speech that sought to pick off some of her supporters, while the Democratic presidential nominee dismissed her rival's plans as a repackaging of old Republican ideas.In an appearance before the Detroit Economic Club on Monday, Mr. Trump fused his populist message with appeals designed to win support from the left -- such as defraying households' child-care costs -- alongside a full embrace of policies on regulation, corporate taxes and energy production to try to please skeptics on the right.""All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production,"" Mr. Trump said in a speech crafted to stabilize his campaign after a rocky week.In St. Petersburg, Fla., Mrs. Clinton fired back at Mr. Trump and his newly announced economic team drawn heavily from real estate and finance. Mr. Trump's tax proposals amount to traditional Republican ""trickle-down economics,"" she said, that ""will give super-big tax breaks to large corporations, just like him and the guys who wrote the speech."" Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to give a speech on the economy on Thursday.Mr. Trump said he would modify his previous tax-cut proposal to mesh it with the framework advanced this summer by House Republicans. Their plan calls for reducing the seven income-tax brackets to three, at 12%, 25% and 33%.The revamp would leave the top rate considerably higher than the 25% that Mr. Trump first proposed last fall. Mr. Trump maintained his original plan to cut corporate taxes to 15% but said he now also supports allowing businesses to immediately write off new investments, a change that brings his tax plan closer to that of House Republicans.The new proposal, coming the week after Mr. Trump was hesitant to endorse several prominent Republicans in their re-election races, looked like ""some sort of peace offering to settle an intraparty squabble,"" said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist who was the policy director for Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and who hasn't endorsed either 2016 nominee. ""He has settled up politically, and he has now done that policy-wise by saying, 'We'll use your tax rates.' ""Mr. Trump promised to unveil a big infrastructure-spending plan, embracing a goal of Democrats, and said he would propose a new way for households to deduct average child-care costs from their taxes.It wasn't clear how such a tax break might be structured, how it would complement existing credits and whether it would be available to tens of millions of families that don't pay income taxes because they have lower incomes.Making child-care expenses deductible, as opposed to offering a tax credit, would be ""a very poorly targeted proposal that would be helpful to high-income households. . .with no significant economic benefits for those who cannot currently afford child care,"" said Chye-Ching Huang, a senior tax analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.Monday's speech came at a critical moment in Mr. Trump's campaign. The latest round of national polls show him losing ground in the race with Mrs. Clinton. Last week's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found him trailing the Democratic nominee by 9 points, and an average of polls tracked by Real Clear Politics shows Mrs. Clinton with a seven-point lead.The GOP nominee promised to withdraw from trade pacts, to label China as a currency manipulator and to enforce existing intellectual-property and other trade rules more aggressively. While Mr. Trump has in the past said he would support bilateral trade agreements, he strongly criticized a 2011 accord between the U.S. and South Korea.He also called Monday for a moratorium on all new regulations from federal agencies, with a specific focus on undoing environmental rules that he said curtail job creation.Mr. Trump's hourlong speech, delivered from a teleprompter, was less freewheeling than his usual style; though he was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, he paused quietly until they were removed. But he launched plenty of attacks on Mrs. Clinton and what he called the failures of the Obama administration, calling the U.S. unemployment rate, which the Labor Department last week said stood at 4.9% in July, ""one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.""Mr. Trump has said his message would resonate with the blue-collar workforce of Michigan and other Rust Belt states, and he has vowed to make the state competitive even though it hasn't voted Republican in a presidential race since 1988. In his speech, while lamenting the economic struggles of Detroit, Mr. Trump made no mention of the federal bailout of the auto industry, which was begun by former President George W. Bush, a Republican, in late 2008 and continued by President Barack Obama.Before the bailout, Mr. Trump gave television interviews indicating support for a government-led rescue of the industry. But during the 2012 election, Mr. Trump said the bailout was a mistake that allowed U.S. auto makers to expand production overseas.Monday's address offered the latest reminder of how deficit worries have receded as an issue. Mrs. Clinton has promised to pay for much of her new spending with higher taxes on top earners, which would hold deficits at their current levels but do little to reduce them.Mr. Trump has suggested he would tolerate wider deficits to spend more on infrastructure, veterans' health-care and national defense at the same time that he reduces taxes.---Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Credit: By Nick Timiraos and Beth Reinhard",11/3/16
Trump's Missteps Sow GOP Unease,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808331293?accountid=12768,"ASHBURN, Va. -- Donald Trump is confronting the roughest patch of his presidential campaign, with even some of his strongest supporters urging him to shift gears and focus more on policy than personality.Republican defections began to multiply Tuesday, including the first GOP member of Congress to endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, as Mr. Trump's standing has dropped in recent polls after engaging in an argument with the parents of a Muslim American soldier who died in Iraq.The New York businessman on Tuesday added to the internal party strife by refusing to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan in his re-election contest next week. Mr. Ryan has said he would back Mr. Trump though he differs with him on several issues.""I'm not quite there yet,"" Mr. Trump told the Washington Post, echoing words Mr. Ryan used to delay his presidential endorsement.The fast-moving developments are unnerving Republicans, even Trump insiders.""This is the decisive moment of defining this election,"" said Newt Gingrich, who was a top candidate to be Mr. Trump's running mate, in an interview. ""He's allowed himself to get dragged down into personality politics, which are to his complete disadvantage. He has to come back to elevate the race to a much bigger set of questions.""Mr. Trump, speaking at a rally here Tuesday, said voters would stick with him over Mrs. Clinton because of his vow to appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court.""They have no choice,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Even if you can't stand Donald Trump, you think Donald Trump is the worst, you're going to vote for me. You know why? Justices of the Supreme Court.""Capping days of criticism by Democrats as well as Republicans over his feud with the Muslim-American family, President Barack Obama called Mr. Trump ""unfit to serve as president,"" and urged GOP leaders to revoke their endorsements of him.""Why are you still endorsing him? What does this say about your party that this is your standard-bearer?"" Mr. Obama said in a joint news conference with the prime minister of Singapore.Mr. Trump suffered another snub later Tuesday when Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. executive Meg Whitman, a prominent Republican, put her support behind Mrs. Clinton. ""Donald Trump's demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character,"" she said in a statement.The Trump campaign spent the last 48 hours trying to change the subject from Mr. Trump's skirmish with the Khan family. On Monday, Mr. Trump suggested the election would be ""rigged"" against him, and his campaign sent a memo to supporters urging them to shift the discussion to Islamic terrorism.Mr. Trump has shown a remarkable ability to bounce back from troubles that would have sidelined any other politician. His supporters have shown a willingness to stick with him. At the Virginia rally, he pointed to a Los Angeles Times poll showing him leading Mrs. Clinton by four points, then went on to dismiss polls as ""phony.""However, many polls conducted after last week's Democratic National Convention show him slipping, even among voters a GOP nominee should be able to take for granted.A CNN poll released Monday found nearly a quarter of self-identified conservative voters saying they will back Mrs. Clinton instead of Mr. Trump. CNN's poll showed Mrs. Clinton with a seven-percentage-point lead overall. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points. Recent polls in solidly Republican Utah and Georgia showed the race very close.An analysis of post-convention polls also suggests that while Mr. Trump has been drawing new voters to the GOP -- especially white working-class voters -- he is losing college-educated whites, who have been important to GOP victories in the past.The GOP's 2012 nominee Mitt Romney won college-educated white voters by 12 percentage points, exit polls showed. But the CNN poll showed Mr. Trump losing those voters by 10 points.""Donald Trump has an election to win so it's hard to understand how picking fights with various members of the party helps him build his base of support,"" said Brian Jones, a political adviser who worked with Mr. Romney in 2012.Mr. Jones has also advised Arizona Sen. John McCain, the party's 2008 presidential nominee who is facing a tough primary fight. In addition to Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump refused to endorse Mr. McCain in the Washington Post interview.A spokesman for Mr. Ryan's campaign said Tuesday, ""Neither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trump's endorsement. And we are confident in a victory next week regardless.""The McCain campaign didn't respond to an email requesting comment.Unlike his turbulent moments in the GOP primary race, Mr. Trump's disparaging remarks about Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who appeared at the Democratic convention, seem to have been a last straw for some Republicans.Rep. Richard Hanna (R., N.Y.), who is retiring at the end of this year, said Monday he would vote for Mrs. Clinton.In a defection that hits closer to home, Maria Comella, a former top aide to Gov. Chris Christie -- a key Trump ally -- said she would be voting for Mrs. Clinton.Bob Livingston, a former Louisiana congressman, said he would stick with Mr. Trump because he is much closer to his views than Mrs. Clinton on core issues. But he said he hopes Mr. Trump recalibrates his strategy.---Aaron Zitner and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook, Reid J. Epstein and Beth Reinhard",11/3/16
Why Trump Shouldn't Write Off the Black Vote,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808301153?accountid=12768,"President Obama announced the death of Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011, a Sunday night. The major networks interrupted their prime-time programming to air the president's remarks, and ABC drew the largest audience because most people were already watching ""Dancing with the Stars."" But NBC had the largest black television audience for the president's speech, and the reason was Donald Trump.Mr. Trump's reality television show, ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" consistently performed well with black viewers. Partly this is because they seem to like the genre. Even cable channels popular with blacks, like BET and VH1, are reality-heavy. ""Celebrity Apprentice"" also regularly featured black contestants, and we all like to watch people on TV who look like us.But Mr. Trump had more than that working in his favor. His phenomenal success as a businessman, and his unabashed pride in his success, also appealed to black audiences. He was rich and wanted everyone to know it. He slapped his name, in the biggest letters possible, on buildings, jets, resorts, casinos and everything else he owned. He surrounded himself with glamorous people and objects. He personified the showy displays of wealth featured in hip-hop music. For many blacks, Mr. Trump's bling and brashness were as impressive as his net worth.The class warfare practiced by liberals stems from a belief that poor minorities sit around resenting white wealth, or should. The reality is that ghetto residents don't hate Bill Gates. They want to be Bill Gates. One of the most successful rap labels in the 2000s was co-founded by Jay Z and called Roc-A-Fella Records, a slang spelling of the Rockefeller family name that's long been synonymous with wealth. Jay Z grew up in a housing project in Brooklyn. He wasn't envious of the superwealthy. He was a go-getter, and today he's worth more than $600 million, according to Forbes.When Donald Trump decided to run for president as a Republican, he already had a standing with black America that most GOP politicians can only dream of. The mystery is why he hasn't capitalized on it, or really even attempted to. Republican outreach to blacks over the decades has wavered between lame and nonexistent. Until recently, the party wagered that it didn't need many minority votes to win national elections and therefore focused its turnout efforts elsewhere. But after President Obama defeated Mitt Romney four years ago, Republican leaders began to change their tune.""If we believe our policies are the best ones to improve the lives of the American people, all the American people, our candidates and officeholders need to do a better job talking in normal, people-oriented terms and we need to go to communities where Republicans do not normally go to listen and make our case,"" the Republican National Committee said in an assessment of the 2012 election. ""We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate we care about them, too.""The advice seems sound. According to the Pew Research Center, 48% of voters either identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, while just 39% identify as Republicans or lean Republican. Popular vote totals have gone Democratic in five of the past six presidential elections, and Mr. Obama won re-election by a not-very-close five million votes. The Republican ""establishment"" candidates who ran this year -- Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich -- embraced this message of inclusion and ran campaigns designed to appeal to more people. Of course, they all lost to Mr. Trump, whose rhetoric toward women, veterans, the disabled, immigrants, Mexicans and others suggests that he has no use for this playbook.Mr. Trump hasn't (yet) offended blacks to the extent that he's offended other groups, but neither has he given many of them a reason to vote for him. Imagine if Mr. Trump took time to campaign in places like Jay Z's old neighborhood and talk to the residents about why so many lots are empty, why all those buildings are boarded up, why foreign nationals run so many of the small businesses, why the bodega charges so much for milk and eggs, why good schools and jobs are so scarce. He could explain why the Democratic politicians they continue to support have made so little progress in these communities. He could explain how he would do things differently. Mr. Trump, billionaire developer, would have both the knowledge and credibility to discuss these matters. And he would have an audience, likely a big one.Mr. Trump is uniquely positioned to suggest alternative policy solutions to a group of voters who may be less willing to hear out other Republicans. To date, however, he's shown little interest in even trying. Instead, Mr. Trump has largely written off the black vote, which may be the most Republican thing about him.---Mr. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Journal contributor, is the author of ""Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed"" (Encounter Books, 2014).(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: It Makes Sense for Trump to Court Black Voters"" -- WSJ August 9, 2016)Credit: By Jason L.

On the Trump Meltdown,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808299778?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump TV commercials should have been ready to go for a week like this: Mr. Trump in shirt sleeves working behind a desk. Mr. Trump in paper-strewn meetings with real-estate colleagues. A collage of Mr. Trump consulting with recognizable movers and shakers.To voters it would have delivered a message that Mr. Trump is a multidimensional person and not just the bombastic figure seen on TV. His marketing shtick, aimed at arousing voters and identifying their concerns, is one thing. Voters also need to believe he has the judgment and discipline to perform the duties of president.To get where he's gotten in life, presumably Mr. Trump is not the stimulus-response entity seen in his poorly contrived response to the parents of U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, killed in action in Iraq. Now would have been a good time to show it.Mr. Trump is not wrong that fundamentalist Islamists treat women badly, or that radical Islam is what we ended up fighting in Iraq, to the cost of Capt. Khan's life. Nor is his free-associating, BSing approach to political communication unique. Media heads describe him as ""lashing out at the parents of a slain American soldier"" -- implying a level of aggression entirely lacking in Mr. Trump's comments. On ABC's Sunday morning show with George Stephanopoulos, a panelist accused him of equating Capt. Khan with radical Islamic terrorists -- as fabulous a lie as any told by Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has crossed a fatal line, all right -- the one that lets the media feel free to put words in his mouth.Mr. Trump's status as a policy outlier can also be exaggerated. You can now go to dinner with respectable economic conservatives and hear that trade is a bad deal if we send them jobs and they send us cheap goods (which would be true if this were in any way an accurate or complete account of how trade works).Both parties are moving left, rapidly, on economics, especially the global economy.Mr. Trump's immediate problem is, when confronted with a staged political attack like that shrewdly set up by orchestrators of the Democratic convention, he has no resource to draw on except his overdependence on tit-for-tat delivered in his own voice and tweets.His campaign doesn't have a second front, using paid TV to send out a more complete image of Mr. Trump -- partly because Mr. Trump has failed utterly to rally the necessary financial support.From here on out, it seems clear that Mr. Trump's limitations as a candidate will predominate in the debate. ""GOP confidence in Senate majority builds"" went a sadly inopportune headline in the Hill newspaper one day before Mr. Trump opposed the re-election of Republican Sen. John McCain. Newly arrived polls show Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats now pulling away after the party conventions.That avatar of political courage Warren Buffett chooses this moment to emerge with a stinging denunciation of Mr. Trump. At a rally in his native Nebraska, one of two states that divvy up their electoral votes by congressional district, Mr. Buffett said he foresaw a tight race in which Mrs. Clinton might need the single vote available from the state's purplish second district.Uh huh. Mr. Buffett would still be hiding under the rug if he thought the race were going to be close.The sage of Omaha speaks truth, however, when he suggests Mr. Trump's claims of business omnicompetence are suspect. Mr. Trump gets credit from pundits for ""understanding"" the frustrations of the white working class, but the white working class might be forgiven for never really understanding a creature as exotic as Donald Trump, a New York playboy and blowhard who has not shrunk from using his personal ""brand"" to play them for suckers on previous occasions (see Trump University).But let's also remember that even if Trump defeats himself, it would not be the same as reaccrediting the Depublican and Remocrat leadership class of which Mrs. Clinton is so spectacular an example. Our system of institutions is not designed to find us the ""right"" person to be our national hero/role model. Its job is to harness and constrain the forces and personalities that democratic populism throws up.Voters are perfectly entitled to ask themselves if one of our major parties has thrown up a candidate unsuitable purely on grounds of personality and temperament, but we also should have some humility about the historical moment we're living through. A narrow Hillary victory or Trump victory might not be outcomes all that distinguishable from each other in the end -- whereas a Clinton landslide that produces, like the first two Obama years, one-party government fundamentally out of sync with the American electorate and out of sync with the national moment could be the larger misfortune.Who knows? But when voters have three months to think about a basically bimodal decision, it's natural that they will begin to think strategically. Even Mr. Trump's gross policy unreliability and personal limitations might turn out not to be the last word come November.Credit: By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.",11/3/16
Trump and the Khans: More to the Story,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808299764?accountid=12768,"'Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president,"" Barack Obama said Tuesday. ""I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it."" The president also asked top Republicans rhetorically: ""Why are you still endorsing him?""Mr. Obama's confrontational electioneering, unusual for a sitting president not seeking re-election, was fallout from last week's Democratic National Convention speech in which Khizr Khan, a Muslim Pakistani-American, denounced Donald Trump: ""You have sacrificed nothing."" Mr. Khan's Emirati-born son, Humayun Khan, a captain in the U.S. Army, was killed in combat in Iraq 12 years ago.Mr. Trump, as is his wont when criticized, fired back. He wondered why Mr. Khan's wife, Ghazala, had stood silently at his side; she later said it was because her son's death was too painful to discuss publicly. ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked Mr. Trump what sacrifices he has made, and he answered unconvincingly: ""I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs.""Unquestionably Mr. Trump behaved like a stupid jerk, but the media narrative is more than a little disingenuous. Take Mr. Khan's j'accuse, ""You have sacrificed nothing."" Does it not apply equally well to Hillary Clinton? She didn't serve in the military, nor did her husband (a fact Republicans hoped vainly would work against him in 1992), and their daughter has lived a pampered life.And as is often the case, Mr. Trump's outrageous behavior finds precedents in his critics' behavior -- in this case, their behavior just the week before, when liberal journalists denounced Patricia Smith, whose son Sean died at Benghazi, for her speech to the Republican Convention. MSNBC's Chris Matthews complained that Mrs. Smith had ""ruined the evening."" The Washington Post's Stephen Stromberg accused her of taking ""an early dip into the gutter."" GQ's Nathaniel Friedman (pen name ""Bethlehem Shoals"") tweeted then deleted: ""I don't care how many children Pat Smith lost I would like to beat her to death.""To be sure, none of these commentators are seeking to become president. But do you remember John Kerry?He launched his public career in 1971 by testifying to a series of outrageous slanders against American servicemen. Subsequently he was elected lieutenant governor of, and U.S. senator from, Massachusetts. He was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, when he presented himself as a war hero.Mr. Kerry has never apologized for his calumnies against his fellow Vietnam veterans, which the liberal media played down as he was pursuing the Democratic nomination. When a group of vets eventually called him out, Democrats and liberal journalists smeared them.In 2013 Mr. Kerry left the Senate after the president nominated him secretary of state. If by Mr. Obama's standards Mr. Trump is unfit to serve because of his obnoxious comments, how is Mr. Kerry fit?---Mr. Taranto writes the Journal's ""Best of the Web Today"" column, from which this is adapted.Credit: By James Taranto",11/3/16
"Election 2016: What Links Trump Economy Team --- Nine of nominee's 14 advisers are known for audacious bets in real estate, finance",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810508575?accountid=12768,"A group of high-profile investors who got rich buying up distressed assets have found their latest turnaround project: Donald Trump's campaign.The Republican presidential nominee last week announced his team of economic advisers, calling the 14 men a ""formidable group of experienced and talented individuals."" The group, including nine drawn from real estate and finance, will help shape Mr. Trump's policies on trade, jobs, regulation and taxes.Those nine are united by more than their wealth. On Wall Street, they are outsiders, known for audacious bets and, sometimes, spectacular flameouts. Five of them are among Mr. Trump's biggest donors, contributing a total of $1.7 million in recent months to his campaign's joint fundraising efforts with the Republican Party.The campaign, trailing in the polls and criticized for naming only men to the economics team, is preparing to disclose the names of as many as 10 additional economic advisers in the next couple of days, including some ""very prominent"" women, according to Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's national finance chairman. Mr. Mnuchin wouldn't identify the new advisers.""The whole intent is to have a combination of people with real-life business experience and economic experience, or specific areas of expertise in the scholarly world,"" said Mr. Mnuchin, who is also one of the economic advisers.Mr. Trump's team includes some of the country's wealthiest self-made men, whose collective net worth is in the tens of billions of dollars. The roster was swiftly criticized by opponents, who not only noted that it was all male but that it contained barely any prominent economists.The team's input helped shape Mr. Trump's economic policy speech Monday in Detroit, which in part was meant to help refocus the struggling campaign on core policy issues. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton mocked the speech as written by ""hedge fund guys, billionaire guys"" and ""six guys named Steve.""""The helpfulness of the team comes from their outside-of-the-system perspectives and positions,"" said Thomas Barrack, founder and executive chairman of Colony Capital Inc., a Los Angeles-based private equity and real-estate firm.Six individuals on the Trump economics team, including Mr. Barrack, have at times pursued ""distressed investing,"" going after assets such as soured mortgages or the debt of struggling companies. When companies restructure their balance sheets, distressed investors can make a neat profit. But the strategy is risky, and is confined to a corner of the finance world.Investor Wilbur Ross said Mr. Trump and Paul Manafort, the campaign's manager, asked him to help formulate trade policy, owing to his long experience as a distressed investor in industries affected by imports and exports, from cars to textiles.Despite some high-profile advisers, Mr. Trump's campaign hasn't won backing from the hundreds of hedge-fund managers, private-equity executives, investment bankers and other money managers who rallied behind Mitt Romney when he was the 2012 GOP nominee. This election, hedge-fund managers and others have given millions to pro-Clinton groups.Mr. Trump has made inroads since hiring Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, as finance chairman in May. A fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee has opened some Wall Street wallets.Activist investor Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management LP recently gave $50,000 to the joint fund, for example, federal records show. After Mr. Trump's public spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq, Mr. Peltz also gave $50,000 to the Democratic National Committee, said a person familiar with the matter.One sign of the overlapping interests of his advisers: a number have done business with each other. In 2009, Mr. Mnuchin and John Paulson, founder of $13 billion hedge fund Paulson & Co., were part of an investment group that bought the assets of IndyMac, a failed lender. The group sold the firm, renamed OneWest Bank, to CIT Group Inc. for $3.4 billion, making a more-than-threefold return on their initial investment.Mr. Paulson declined to comment through a spokesman.Perhaps the most surprising member of Mr. Trump's team is Stephen Feinberg, the reclusive co-founder of private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, who hasn't been an active participant in politics.Cerberus became well known for buying Chrysler in 2007, only to have its equity wiped out in the auto maker's bankruptcy. Cerberus later recouped some of its investment through the sale of Chrysler's lending unit -- thanks in part to the Obama administration's bailout of the auto industry.---Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.Credit: By Anupreeta Das",11/4/16
Trump's Contribution to Sound Money,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810507313?accountid=12768,"The surest way to become alienated from Donald Trump supporters is to invoke the word ""global"" with regard to trade or economic interests. Even if you embrace the Trump economic agenda for enhancing U.S. competitiveness by lowering taxes and easing regulation, even if you support an ""America First"" approach for tackling domestic shortcomings from education to infrastructure -- there is still a negative stigma attached to proposing any kind of global economic initiative.Yet by insisting that the U.S. Treasury label China a ""currency manipulator"" and by promoting trade that is both free and ""fair,"" Mr. Trump may be laying the groundwork for a significant breakthrough in international monetary relations -- one that could ultimately validate the rationale for an open global marketplace and restore genuine free trade as a vital component of economic growth.The notion that something good might come out of a Trump policy elicits guffaws in certain economic circles. And questioning whether today's exchange-rate regime serves the cause of beneficial cross-border commerce is tantamount to advocating protectionism. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump's emphasis on currency manipulation brings into focus the shortcomings of our present international monetary system -- volatility, persistent imbalances, currency mismatches -- which testify to its dysfunction. Indeed, today's hodgepodge of exchange-rate mechanisms is routinely described as a ""non-system."" Or, as former International Monetary Fund chief Jacques de Larosiere termed it at a Vienna conference in February 2014, an ""anti-system.""If monetary scholars once diligently sought to explain the relative virtues of fixed-versus-flexible exchange rates on global economic performance, they have largely abdicated any responsibility for the escalating political backlash against trade that blames currency manipulation for lost business.No serious economist would claim today that the ""dirty float"" intervention tactics practiced by numerous countries would be remotely acceptable within the freely flexible exchange-rate system envisaged by Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman. Nor would anyone suggest that any coherent mechanism exists comparable with the fixed-rate system anchored by a gold-convertible dollar that reigned in the decades following World War II.Nobel Laureate Robert Mundell has consistently argued for the restoration of a system of formally maintained exchange rates to reduce uncertainty and promote growth. Yet the lack of willingness among the great majority of economists to recognize the imperative for global monetary reform to avoid a breakdown in global trade relations has left policy makers in the lurch. Faced with mounting demands to address currency manipulation through ""strong and enforceable provisions"" -- i.e., tariffs -- those who support free trade are being forced to consider the broader implications of a sluggish world economy that has become overly reliant on central banks.Is it more egregious when governments deliberately intervene in foreign-exchange markets to manipulate currencies to gain an export advantage -- or when central banks seek to accomplish the same thing through monetary policy?The point is that today's free-for-all approach to international monetary relations permits nations to pursue any exchange-rate policy they wish. Relative currency values are thus vulnerable not only to the manipulative tactics of government authorities, but also to the speculative maneuvering of foreign-exchange traders -- the most active of which, in a market that averages $4.9 trillion in daily volume, are the world's largest banks.No wonder so many workers employed by U.S. companies that manufacture products requiring substantial capital investment -- automobiles and tractors, computer and electronic equipment -- have become disenchanted with the supposed long-term benefits of free trade. It is one thing to lose sales to a foreign competitor whose product delivers the best quality for the money; it's another to lose sales as a consequence of an unforeseen exchange-rate slide that distorts the comparative prices of competing goods.To brand trade skeptics as sore losers is to malign them unfairly. To resent being victimized by currency movements is not the same as being opposed to free trade, nor does it signal an eagerness to engage in protectionist retaliation. It's simply an honest response to incongruity: We need to reconcile global monetary arrangements with global trade aspirations.As former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker has observed: ""Trade flows are affected more by ten minutes of movement in the currency markets than by ten years of (even successful) negotiations.""Mr. Trump's forceful rhetoric may help put an end to the politically correct attitude so prevalent among economists that breezily dismisses what was once accepted as a truism: Stable exchange rates foster long-term prosperity by maximizing the productive use of economic resources and financial capital. Why continue to passively accept the negative economic consequences of global monetary disorder? Why permit legitimately earned profits from business operations and investments in foreign countries to be wiped out by unpredictable currency losses? Why hold global economic growth prospects hostage to antiquated exchange-rate arrangements?It's time to end the intellectual vacuum and focus on serious initiatives for global monetary reform. The goal is to maximize prosperity by harnessing the power of free-market signals across borders. Monetary clarity is the key to reconciling the principles of free trade with the promised benefits of an open global marketplace.By focusing on currency manipulation as an unfair trade practice, Mr. Trump has not only identified the crux of the economic dilemma, he has also spotlighted the social and political tensions its consequences have fostered.---Ms. Shelton, an economist, is author of ""Money Meltdown"" (Free Press, 1994) and co-director of the Sound Money Project at the Atlas Network, a nonprofit that promotes free markets and economic liberty.Credit: By Judy Shelton",11/4/16
Election 2016: Clinton Again Knocks Trump Over Foreign Products,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808567744?accountid=12768,"DENVER -- Hillary Clinton on Wednesday jabbed at Donald Trump's practice of manufacturing his companies' products overseas, building on her argument that the Republican rival is focused on enriching himself more than bolstering U.S. businesses.The Democratic nominee visited a necktie company in the battleground state of Colorado to underscore the point that some businesses produce neckwear in the U.S. while Trump-brand ties are made in China.Mrs. Clinton stuck largely to her own script and ignored the controversies swirling around Mr. Trump, such as his quarrel with the family of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq and his unwillingness to endorse top officials in his own party facing re-election.The turmoil surrounding the Trump campaign has threatened to drown out Mrs. Clinton's own message in recent days, but the former secretary of state has continued to focus on outlining her economic vision.In Colorado, Mrs. Clinton highlighted her job-creation plan and told supporters that as president she would invest in U.S. manufacturing.Mrs. Clinton visited the Knotty Tie Co. in Denver, which produces made-to-order neckties, pocket squares, scarves and other accessories. It was one of an assortment of factories and manufacturers in battleground states that the former senator from New York has used as backdrops for her jobs tour as she highlights Mr. Trump's record of producing men's suits, picture frames and other items in foreign countries.At each stop, Mrs. Clinton has criticized Mr. Trump and his oft-repeated campaign slogan, saying that if the New York businessman wants to make America great again, ""he could start by actually making things in America again.""At Knotty Tie, where a U.S. flag hung from the ceiling and Hillary-themed ties were on display, Mrs. Clinton offered effusive praise for the ties and scarves, as well as for the company's policy of hiring refugees.""I wish Donald Trump could meet all of you and see what you are making here and hear the stories of people who have come together to produce products and create more opportunity for more people,"" she said. ""I really would like him to explain why he paid Chinese workers to make Trump ties.""Mr. Trump has said relatively little about her assertion that he has shipped jobs overseas.The Republican nominee told ABC News in June that China and other countries have ""taken us to the cleaners"" by devaluing their currency and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete.""Unfortunately, my ties are made in China, and I will say this, the hats -- 'Make America Great Again' -- I searched long and hard to find somebody that made the hats in this country,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It was a very hard thing to do.""The Trump campaign website says that items for sale on the site are ""100% made in the USA.""A new Clinton campaign ad that will begin airing in battleground states this week also aims to remind voters of where Trump-label products are made. The ad shows Mr. Trump touting his clothing line during an October 2012 appearance on the ""Late Show With David Letterman.""When asked where the ties, shirts and other products are produced, Mr. Trump said, ""I don't know where they were made, but they were made someplace.""After Mr. Letterman pointed out that the dress shirts came from Bangladesh, Mr. Trump told him, ""It's good. We employ people in Bangladesh.""Credit: By Colleen McCain Nelson",11/4/16
Victory Is Slipping Away for Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1808566210?accountid=12768,"Last month's Republican and Democratic national conventions showed that both parties are deeply split internally over ideology and personalities. Not only that, but their presidential nominees remain highly unpopular.The GOP gathering in Cleveland was poorly produced and featured the presidential primary's runner-up, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, in a prime-time appearance pointedly refusing to endorse Donald Trump.The Democratic convention in Philadelphia was marred by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, enraged by hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee showing that the party establishment favored Hillary Clinton. They booed the party's chairwoman out of office and chanted ""no more war"" when Democratic leaders spoke of fighting Islamic State and al Qaeda.Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton polished their flawed images, but the Democrat did a better job. Between July 17 and this Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton's favorable rating rose to 40.6% from 38.4% in the Real Clear Politics average. Her unfavorable rating dropped to 53.9% from 56.2%. That's a total swing of four and a half points.During the same period Mr. Trump's favorable rating moved to 35.3% from 33.6% and his unfavorable rating to 57.9% from 60.1%, a total swing of 3.9 points.The general-election campaign has hardly begun, and data from Gallup shows that both candidates are more widely disliked than any presidential hopeful since at least the 1960s. Even in October 1964, Barry Goldwater's unfavorability rating was 47%, while in October of 1972 George McGovern's was 41%.Mrs. Clinton appears to have received the bigger convention bounce. The day before the GOP gathering, she led Mr. Trump 43.8% to 40.6% in the Real Clear Politics average. By July 25, the Republican was in front, 44.3% to 44.1%. On Wednesday Mrs. Clinton was back ahead with 46.5% to his 42%.Whether this boost is temporary or durable won't be known for a few days. But Mr. Trump's self-destructive actions in the past few weeks have given her the advantage.He began the morning after his convention by devoting his news conference to again trashing Mr. Cruz, including reviving the crazy theory that the Texas senator's father was implicated in JFK's assassination. Mr. Trump then returned to his Manhattan penthouse for the weekend, going silent until ""Meet the Press"" that Sunday, where he proposed a 15% to 35% tax on imported goods.Then the next week, amid charges that Russian hackers were behind the Democratic National Committee email dump, Mr. Trump suggested that maybe the Russians could help find Mrs. Clinton's missing 30,000 emails.Most damaging, Mr. Trump has for the past week battled with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Gold Star parents of a fallen war hero. He even mocked the grieving mother. This is unprecedented cruelty.But that isn't all. On Sunday Mr. Trump suggested that the election is ""rigged"" because debates this fall were scheduled months ago on nights with NFL football games. He attacked fire marshals in Colorado and Ohio for enforcing the fire codes that limited how many people could cram into his rallies.On Tuesday he refused to endorse two prominent Republicans up for re-election, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, in their primaries. Then he belittled Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican facing a tough race that could determine whether the GOP keeps the Senate.How does any of this advance Mr. Trump's agenda or reassure Americans that he is worthy of support? The nominee's defenders say that he ""tells it like it is"" and refuses to be ""politically correct."" They are only enabling his worst instincts.Imagine if Mr. Trump had opened his post-convention news conference with a bold rallying cry on the issues and then spent three days barnstorming battleground states, appearing with workers, small-business owners and first responders.Rather than fighting with the Khans, he could have seized on Friday's lousy GDP report to explain how a Trump White House would result in more jobs, bigger paychecks and greater prosperity. Instead of grousing about debate schedules Sunday and attacking fire marshals, Mr. Trump could have responded to Mrs. Clinton's interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News, where she continued lying about her private email server.No one on Team Trump -- especially not the principal -- appears to have a plan for what messages to emphasize and when. No one seems charged with watching what Mrs. Clinton says so the candidate can quickly volley back. No one restrains Mr. Trump before he activates his Twitter account. Ad hoc may be freewheeling and fun, but it often leads to defeat.The White House is not out of reach for Mr. Trump, who now trails by 4.5% in the Real Clear average. But victory is slipping away. If he has more weeks like the dreadful past two, the gap between him and Mrs. Clinton is likely to widen and never close again.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",11/4/16
"Whoever Wins, Capitalism Will Survive; Don't despair. Trump or Clinton may be a dismal choice. But the U.S. economy is resilient.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836482392?accountid=12768,"As Americans prepare to make what many see as a depressing choice between presidential candidates, they shouldn't despair. Yes, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton don't sound like wise stewards of economic policy. And yes, we have some problems that need serious attention, such as a badly distorted credit market and an unworkable Affordable Care Act. But the American capitalist economy has become extremely powerful and can most likely withstand further abuse, however unwelcome.It was not always thus. In the 1930s, a much smaller, heavily agrarian American economy was in danger of falling victim to statism. The ""Great Depression"" began in 1929 with a downturn in the business-credit cycle that precipitated a stock-market crash. The market was recovering in 1930 but the real economy didn't rebound as it had after a similar crash in 1920.New Deal historians called what happened a ""crisis of capitalism."" In fact, capitalism was doing great in the 1920s. Henry Ford was cranking out Model Ts that almost anyone could afford. Housewives were buying labor-saving tools like electric vacuums and washing machines on the installment plan. Fat Sears and Montgomery Ward catalogs offered the bounty of capitalism to dwellers in even the remotest farm houses.It was public policy that deepened an ordinary recession and prolonged it for a decade. The Depression was a demonstration of what happens when the government responds to a downturn with excessive interference with market forces.The seeds of the Depression were planted with the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, in a two-year interval in which President Woodrow Wilson had a compliant Democratic Congress. The act set up 12 regional government banks to make preferential loans to farmers. Farmers had done well earlier, so much so that years later they would ask the government to support prices on a parity with the year 1912. But the 1916 government venture damaged country banks with unfair competition and encouraged farmers to overproduce. That lowered prices.Calvin Coolidge fended off their demands for relief from low prices but Herbert Hoover refinanced the FFLA, suggesting that he was an easier mark than Coolidge. After the 1929 crash, farmers again pressured the Republican Congress for relief, prompting Sen. Reed Smoot of Utah and Rep. Willis C. Hawley of Oregon to draft a bill raising tariffs on farm products. Had Congress stopped there the damage would have been limited. But lobbyists for industry and labor demanded protection as well. The final Smoot-Hawley bill doubled already-high tariffs on 20,000 dutiable items to an average of 50% of value.Ignoring his own better instincts and a petition signed by more than 1,000 economists, Hoover signed Smoot-Hawley into law. The sharp drop-off in trade that resulted sent prices plummeting, worsening what was already a deflationary cycle caused by the loss of liquidity in the crash. Europeans were inhibited from selling goods in the U.S. to earn dollars to buy U.S. products and pay their war debts. The reduced flow of funds worsened deflation. Europe's retaliation with tariff increases made matters worse. A global money shortage ensued.U.S. exports nose-dived to $1.7 billion in 1933 from $5.2 billion in 1929, with farmers--big exporters even then--hit the hardest. Democrats swept the 1932 elections but instead of giving the country less market interference they gave it more.The most egregious was the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, which required businesses to adopt 557 ""codes"" to prevent price cutting. These cartels violated the key principle that market competition is the guarantor of a vigorous, efficient economy. The NIRA veered the U.S. close to European-style fascism, which had many admirers at that time. Fortunately, the Supreme Court put it out of its misery in 1935, declaring it an unconstitutional extension of government power.Despite Smoot-Hawley, the New Deal's revolutionary farm production quotas, the NIRA and FDR's attacks on capitalism, the business cycle turned upward in 1933. Unemployment fell from nearly a quarter of the labor force that year to 17% in 1936. But then the ""second New Deal"" Congress slapped a tax on ""surplus"" business profits, the equivalent of a tax on job-creating investment. The market crashed again in 1937 and took the economy with it.In 1940 FDR, to his credit, realized that to rearm a militarily weak America he badly needed the capitalists he had spurned and often reviled. He made peace with them and they responded magnificently, especially after Japan's December 1941 attack, quickly mobilizing their factories to perform amazing feats of weapons production.That performance, plus the defeat and discrediting of fascists Hitler and Mussolini and the outset of the Cold War with ultra-statist Stalin gave Americans a new appreciation for market capitalism. Largely unfettered in the postwar era, privately owned corporations produced the technological marvels and high living standards we enjoy today.The system is under threat again. But it is far stronger now than it was in the 1930s. History is not on the side of the statists.Cheer up, if you can.Mr. Melloan, a former deputy editor of the Journal editorial page, is the author of ""When the New Deal Came to Town,"" out this week from Simon & Schuster.Credit: By George Melloan",11/6/16
The Cost of Obama's Cuba Policy; Exiles who oppose normalization could give Trump Florida's 29 electoral votes.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836482386?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are in a statistical dead heat in Florida, where the state's 29 electoral votes will be pivotal in Tuesday's presidential election. One surprise for Democrats is that President Obama's December 2014 decision to liberalize U.S. Cuba policy is not helping their nominee as the White House expected it to. Instead, it has become a liability.Mr. Obama and Democrats bet big on the hypothesis that the traditional hard-line approach to dealing with the Castro regime, which encouraged the Cuban diaspora of the 1960s, '70s and '80s, is passe. And that new generations of Cuban-Americans, either U.S. born or more-recently arrived, favor economic and political engagement with the regime.By spinning the president's more-liberal travel policy to the island as an opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of Cuban change, the administration also hoped to gin up enthusiasm in Miami for his kinder, gentler attitude toward the communist military dictatorship. Mr. Obama's detente with Cuba was supposed to be a political winner.Just 23 months later that theory is being tested.Cuban-Americans who initially supported Mr. Obama's outreach are increasingly disillusioned with an administration strategy that helps the Castros but leaves out the Cuban people. This could affect turnout among left-of-center voters who care about human rights.The Obama policy also seems to be energizing greater numbers of conservative and independent Cuban-Americans to rally behind the Republican candidate. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll released on Oct. 30 had the New York real-estate developer leading Mrs. Clinton 52% to 42% among Cuban-Americans. Some read this as a result of recent Trump efforts in south Florida to make himself a champion of Cuban exiles. But it is more likely a rise in the protest vote.The U.S. trade embargo, which dates to 1962, was codified into U.S. law in 1996. Lifting it requires congressional approval. But Mr. Obama has normalized relations with Havana, a step aimed at lending legitimacy to the gangster government. He also has used an executive order to liberalize U.S. travel to Cuba and has licensed some U.S. hotels to operate on the island.The administration's public explanation for the change was that economic engagement with Cuba would hasten the fall of the dictatorship.A less charitable reading of Mr. Obama's motivations suggests that he harbors ideological sympathy for the Cuban Revolution and believes that the Castros would treat Cubans humanely if only the U.S. would demonstrate tolerance for tropical totalitarianism.Regardless of which narrative you prefer, the president badly miscalculated. Even his supporters have noticed.A July 1 column in the Miami Herald by Cuban-born Fabiola Santiago, who described herself as having been a supporter ""of the president's policy of engagement with the goal of improving the lives of the Cuban people,"" captured the disillusionment. Ms. Santiago was particularly peeved about the opening of the Four Points Sheraton Havana, ""brought to you, American traveler, by the people who repress Cubans.""The columnist explained that the Obama opening was sold as a path that would allow American companies to partner in joint ventures with Cuban entrepreneurs. Instead, she wrote, referring to Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which owns Sheraton, ""the American hospitality giant is in business with the Cuban military, which owns the hotel."" As she observed, that changes nothing. ""We're only shifting from the Castro brothers and family personally enriching themselves through totalitarian rule to the repressive military now doing exactly the same thing.""Ms. Santiago quoted the similar sentiments of Richard Blanco, the Cuban-American poet who was tapped to read at the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Havana in August 2015: ""How will [the goal of bringing prosperity to the Cuban people] be realized if basically they are doing what other foreign investors have done, namely, strike a deal with the government that leaves the ordinary Cubans in the same situation? How is this any better, simply because it's the U.S.?""If this is how supporters are assessing Mr. Obama's Cuba project, it's not hard to picture Cuban-Americans who either took a wait-and-see approach, or oppose the Obama policy, viewing this election as a chance to vote against it in order to aid their Cuban brethren. By pledging to stick with the policy, Mrs. Clinton has made herself a target.The Cuban economy is in tatters and the regime is backtracking on promises of reform. Human-rights groups say that beatings and detentions of dissidents have soared since the U.S. extended the olive branch. Yet Mr. Obama keeps making concessions to the Castros, as he did on Oct. 14 when he authorized further sanctions relief.No matter who wins on Tuesday, the next president will have to clean up this Cuba mess. Decent Cuban-Americans on both sides of the aisle want answers.Write to O'Grady@wsj.com.Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady",11/7/16
Don't Believe the Economic Pessimists; Memo to Clinton and Trump: The U.S. economy can and will grow faster with the right policies.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836482343?accountid=12768,"No matter who wins Tuesday's presidential election, now ought to be the time that policy makers in Washington come together to tackle America's greatest economic problem: sclerotic growth. The recession ended more than seven years ago. Unemployment has returned to normal levels. Yet gross domestic product is rising at half its postwar average rate. Achieving better growth is possible, but it will require deep structural reforms.The policy worthies have said for eight years: stimulus today, structural reform tomorrow. Now it's tomorrow, but novel excuses for stimulus keep coming. ""Secular stagnation"" or ""hysteresis"" account for slow growth. Prosperity demands more borrowing and spending--even on bridges to nowhere--or deliberate inflation or negative interest rates. Others advocate surrender. More growth is impossible. Accept and manage mediocrity.But for those willing to recognize the simple lessons of history, slow growth is not hard to diagnose or to cure. The U.S. economy suffers from complex, arbitrary and politicized regulation. The ridiculous tax system and badly structured social programs discourage work and investment. Even internet giants are now running to Washington for regulatory favors.If you think robust growth is impossible, consider a serious growth-oriented policy program--one that could even satisfy many of the left's desires.* Taxes. The ideal tax system raises revenue for the government while distorting economic decisions as little as possible. A pure tax on consumption, with no corporate, income, estate, or other taxes is pretty close to that ideal.The U.S. tax system is the opposite: By exempting lots of income, the government raises relatively little money. Yet an extra dollar is heavily taxed, greatly lowering incentives and encouraging people to find or create exemptions. This massive complexity and obscurity undermine faith in the system.Progressives, ponder this: With a sales tax of only 25%, the government would likely have gotten a lot more money from Donald Trump--who has employed complex but legal tax-avoidance schemes--than it did by purporting to tax income at high rates.* Regulation. U.S. regulation is arbitrary, slow, discretionary and politicized. Speak out on the wrong side of the party in power and some federal agency will be after you.Imagine a deep rule-of-law regulatory reform, along the lines proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""Better Way"" plan. Congress must review and approve major regulations. People and businesses have a right to see evidence and appeal. Regulators face a shot clock--no more years and years of delays on decisions. Agencies must conduct serious, transparent and retrospective cost-benefit analysis.Imagine a similar deep reform of state and local restrictions including zoning laws and occupational-licensing regulations.* Social programs. When many people earn an extra dollar, they lose more than a dollar of benefits. If we fixed these disincentives, more Americans would work--and fewer would need benefits.* Health. Replace ObamaCare with a simple health-insurance voucher. Deregulate insurance and entry into health care dramatically.* Finance. Replace strangling regulation of financial companies with a simple rule: If you issue enough equity that stockholders bear the risks, you can do what you want. Rep. Jeb Hensarling has proposed such legislation. Hearty competition is the best consumer protection.* Labor. The best worker protection is a worker's ability to swiftly change jobs. This is more likely if employers do not face a mountain of red tape, complex rules and legal liability.* Immigration and trade. The politically incorrect truth: Allowing Americans to buy from the best supplier and permitting people who want to work and start businesses to immigrate is good for the economy. Trying to impoverish China will not revive America.* Education. Let lower-income Americans get a decent education from charter schools and vouchers.* Energy. Trade all the crony subsidies and credits and regulations for a simple uniform revenue-neutral carbon tax. The country will have more growth and less carbon.It would take an entrenched obtuseness to claim such a program cannot substantially improve economic output and incomes. If you claim such good policy cannot help, then it follows that bad policies do not hurt. Nativism, trade barriers, overregulation, legal capture, high taxes, controlled markets and people excluded from work won't hurt our slow but positive growth. Don't give populists cover to try it again.If you object that such good policy is politically infeasible, then you at least grant that robust growth is economically possible. And small steps help. Current bipartisan proposals to reform taxes, Social Security, immigration, the regulatory state and trade agreements would go a long way to reviving growth. Have a bit more faith in democracy.On the other hand, the major party presidential candidates' signature plans--child-care tax credits, college subsidies, higher taxes on people who don't hire good enough lawyers; threatening a trade war and deporting millions of unauthorized immigrants--cannot revive substantial growth.So why is there so little talk of serious growth-oriented policy? Regulated and protected industries and unions, and the politicians who extract support from them in return for favors, will lose enormously. The global policy elite, steeped in Keynesian demand management for the economy as a whole, and microregulation of individual businesses, are intellectually unprepared for the hard project of ""structural reform""--fixing the entire economy by cleaning up the thousands of little messes. Even economists fight to protect outdated skills.Mr. Cochrane is a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution and an adjunct scholar of the Cato Institute.Credit: By John H. Cochrane",11/7/16
"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, This Is Your One Shot at the Presidency; Since Nixon defeated McGovern in '72, the unwritten rule has been once you're out, you're out.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836093495?accountid=12768,"Even before the presidential campaign turned so bizarre, one truth should have been abundantly evident to both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: The one who finishes in second place on Tuesday night won't be his or her party's nominee for the presidency in 2020. It is predestined--or at least it is what recent American political history irrefutably teaches us.More than half a century has passed since a defeated presidential candidate later went on to be nominated again by his party. In 1960 Richard Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy; the Republicans turned to him again in 1968, when he defeated Hubert Humphrey, and again in 1972, when he defeated George McGovern.Since then the unwritten rule has been, once you're out, you're out. It doesn't matter how highly regarded you may be among your fellow Republicans or Democrats on the evening they nominate you: If they have made you their standard-bearer and then you lose, no matter how narrowly, your prospects for being given another opportunity are zero. In the land of second chances, vanquished presidential nominees need not apply.This is a relatively new phenomenon. Earlier in the nation's history it was quite common for a presidential candidate to lose and then to be given one (or more) opportunities to head his party's ticket. The person was presumed to possess the same qualities, principles and talents that made him good enough to be a nominee in the first place.Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, was elected president in 1884, but lost his re-election bid to Benjamin Harrison in 1888. The Democrats turned right back to him in 1892, when he defeated Harrison. The Democrats liked William Jennings Bryan enough to nominate him in 1896; he lost to William McKinley, but the Democrats had him lead their party against McKinley again in 1900. Bryan lost that time, too, but by 1908 his party was having him lead the ticket once more. He lost to William Howard Taft.Republican Thomas E. Dewey lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the election of 1944, but that didn't stop his party from running him against Harry Truman in 1948. Adlai Stevenson was the Democrats' nominee against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952; Ike won in a landslide, but when 1956 rolled around, the Democrats went with Stevenson anew.Since Nixon, though, every election-night candidate who has come in second, regardless of how experienced or gifted, has been considered as disposable as a grocery-shelf item whose sell-by date has passed. No ""We'll get 'em next time, pal."" Do modern-era presidents who have served a term and then lost an election have an honest hope of being asked to lead their party's ticket one more time? Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush discovered the answer to that.In today's America the measure of public devotion is calculated in social media fans. In the world of popular culture, Kim Kardashian West has 48.8 million Twitter followers; her husband, Kanye West, has 26.4 million. Singer Britney Spears has 48.6 million; actor Leonardo DiCaprio has 16.4 million; basketball star LeBron James has 33.4 million.Very impressive numbers. Marketers swoon over them. But consider this:More than 50 million Americans voted for Al Gore in 2000. More than 59 million voted for John Kerry in 2004. More than 59 million voted for John McCain in 2008. More than 60 million voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. And those tens of millions of voters who put their faith in their candidates had to do more than touch a ""follow"" button on a smartphone screen. They had to leave the house, many of them in brutal November weather; they had to get up early so they could vote before work, or get home late so they could vote after the factory whistle blew. They had to stand in long lines. They had to make a genuine effort to show their loyalty.Yet for each of the rejected candidates with the huge followings, people who had risen over the years to the highest echelons of their respective parties, who had built up the good will of all those voters, the morning-after presumption was: You're done. They each now carried the most insurmountable, indelible label a presidential candidate can bear: runner-up.It will soon happen to either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. The one who fails to prevail won't be back in 2020. The strange game of leading a major-party ticket has become a single-elimination tournament. It has turned into the political-world version of the promotional catchphrase heard on television every year during the National Basketball Association playoffs: Win or go home.Mr. Greene's books include ""Chevrolet Summers, Dairy Queen Nights"" (Harper Perennial, 2001).Credit: By Bob Greene",11/7/16
"How to Get Beyond Our Tribal Politics; Whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins Tuesday, understanding the psychological causes of our national rift can help us bridge it",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836011023?accountid=12768,"The most-watched made-for-TV movie in American history is ""The Day After,"" a 1983 portrayal of life in Kansas in the days just before and after an all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union. If you've had even fleeting thoughts that Tuesday's election could bring about the end of the world or the destruction of the country, you might want to find ""The Day After"" on YouTube, scroll to minute 53 and watch the next six minutes. Now that's an apocalypse.It's an absurd comparison, of course, but the absurdity is helpful. It reminds us that no matter how bad things seem, we have a lot to be grateful for. The Soviet Union is gone, and life in America has gotten much better since the 1980s by most objective measures. Crime is way down, prosperity and longevity are way up, and doors are open much more widely for talented people from just about any demographic group. Yes, we have new problems, and the benefits haven't been spread evenly, but if you look at the big picture, we are making astonishing progress.Watching ""The Day After"" also might help Americans to tone down the apocalyptic language that so many have used about the presidential race. On the right, some speak of this as the ""Flight 93 election,"" meaning that America has been hijacked by treasonous leftists who are trying to crash the plane, so electing Donald Trump to rush the cockpit is the only sane choice. On the left, some think that a Trump victory would lead to a constitutional crisis followed by a military coup, fascism and dictatorship.Nearly half the country will therefore wake up deeply disappointed on the morning of Nov. 9, and many members of the losing side will think that America is doomed. Those on the winning side will feel relieved, but many will be shocked and disgusted that nearly half of their fellow citizens voted for the moral equivalent of the devil. The disgust expressed by both sides in this election is particularly worrisome because disgust dehumanizes its targets. That is why it is usually fostered by the perpetrators of genocide--disgust makes it easier for ordinary citizens to kill their neighbors.In short, the day after this election is likely to be darker and more foreboding than the day after just about any U.S. election since 1860. Is it possible for Americans to forgive, accept and carry on working and living together?We think that it is. After all, civility doesn't require consensus or the suspension of criticism. It is simply the ability to disagree productively with others while respecting their sincerity and decency. That can be hard to do when emotions run so high. But if we understand better the psychological causes of our current animosity, we can all take some simple steps to turn it down, free ourselves from hatred and make the next four years better for ourselves and the country. Three time-honored quotations can serve as guides.Human nature is tribal. We form teams easily, most likely because we have evolved for violent intergroup conflict. Our minds take to it so readily that we invent myths, games and sports--including war games like paintball--that let us enjoy the pleasures of intergroup conflict without the horrors of actual war.The tribal mind is adept at changing alliances to face shifting threats, as the Bedouin saying indicates. We see such shifts after party primaries, when those who backed a losing candidate swing around to support the nominee. And we saw it happen after the 9/11 attacks, when the country came together to support the president and the military in the invasion of Afghanistan.But with the exception of the few months after 9/11, cross-partisan animosity has been rising steadily since the late 1990s. This year, for the first time since Pew Research began asking in 1994, majorities in both parties expressed not just ""unfavorable"" views of the other party but ""very unfavorable"" views . Those ratings were generally below 20% throughout the 1990s. And more than 40% in each party now see the policies of the other party as being ""so misguided that they threaten the nation's well-being."" Those numbers are up by about 10% in both parties just since 2014.So what will happen the next time there is a major terrorist attack? Will we come together again? Or will the attack become a partisan football within hours, as happened after the various lone-wolf attacks of the past year? Something is broken in American tribalism. It is now ""my brothers and me against my cousins"" all the time, even when we are threatened by strangers and even when there is no threat at all.Democracy requires trust and cooperation as well as competition. A healthy democracy features flexible and shifting coalitions. We must find a way to see citizens on the other side as cousins who are sometimes opponents but who share most of our values and interests and are never our mortal enemies.Our tribal minds are equipped with a powerful tool: shameless and clueless hypocrisy. It is a general rule of psychology that ""thinking is for doing"": We think with a particular purpose in mind, and often that purpose isn't to find the truth but to defend ourselves or attack our opponents.Psychologists call this process ""motivated reasoning."" It is found whenever self-interest is in play. When the interests of a group are added to the mix, this sort of biased, god-awful reasoning becomes positively virtuous--it signals your loyalty to the team. This is why partisans find it so easy to dismiss scandalous revelations about their own candidate while focusing so intently on scandalous revelations about the other candidate.Motivated reasoning has interacted with tribalism and new media technologies since the 1990s in unfortunate ways. Social media, hackers and Google searches now help us to find hundreds of specks in our opponents' eyes, but no technology can force us to acknowledge the logs in our own.Humans are tribal, but tribalism can be transcended. It exists in tension with our extraordinary ability to develop bonds with other human beings. Romeo and Juliet fell in love. French, British and German soldiers came out of their trenches in World War I to exchange food, cigarettes and Christmas greetings.The key, as Cicero observed, is proximity, and a great deal of modern research backs him up. Students are more likely to become friends with the student whose dorm room is one door away than with the student whose room is four doors away. People who have at least one friend from the other political party are less likely to hate the supporters of that party.But tragically, Americans are losing their proximity to those on the other side and are spending more time in politically purified settings. Since the 1980s, Democrats have been packing into the cities while the rural areas and exurbs have been getting more Republican. Institutions that used to bring people together--such as churches--are now splitting apart over culture war issues such as gay marriage.Ever more of our social life is spent online, in virtual communities or networks that are politically homogeneous. When we do rub up against the other side online, relative anonymity often leads to stunning levels of incivility, including racist and sexist slurs and threats of violence.So are we doomed? Will the polarizing trends identified by Pew just keep going until the country splits in two? Maybe John Adams was right in 1814 when he wrote, ""Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.""But we have lasted 240 years so far, and both sides agree that America is worth fighting for. We just have to see that the fight isn't always against each other; it is also a struggle to adapt our democracy and our habits for polarizing times and technologies.Some of these adaptations will require changes to laws and institutions. Some will come from improving technology as we fine-tune social media to reward productive disagreement while filtering out trolling and intimidation.And many of the changes must come from each of us, as individuals who have friends, co-workers and cousins who voted for the other side. How will we treat them as customers, employees, students and neighbors? What will we say to them at Thanksgiving dinner?If you would like to let go of anger on Nov. 9 without letting go of your moral and political principles, here is some advice, adapted from ancient wisdom and modern research.First, separate your feelings about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from your feelings about their supporters. Political scientists report that since the 1980s, Americans have increasingly voted against the other side's candidate, rather than voting enthusiastically for their own, and that is especially true this time. So don't assume that most people on the other side like or even agree with their candidate on any particular issue. They may be voting out of fears and frustrations that you don't understand, but if you knew their stories, you might well empathize with them.Second, step back and think about your goals. In the long run, would you rather change people or hate them? If you actually want to persuade or otherwise influence people, you should know that it is nearly impossible to change people's minds by arguing with them. When there is mutual antipathy, there is mutual motivated reasoning, defensiveness and hypocrisy.But anything that opens the heart opens the mind as well, so do what you can to cultivate personal relationships with those on the other side. Spend time together, and let the proximity recommended by Cicero strengthen ties. Familiarity does not breed contempt. Research shows that as things or people become familiar, we like them more.Emotions often drive reasoning, so as our hearts harden, our thinking also calcifies, and we become dogmatic. We are less able to think flexibly and address the social problems that we claim to care about. As John Stuart Mill wrote in 1859, ""He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that."" So cultivating a few cross-partisan friendships will make you smarter as well as calmer, even if polarization grows worse.And if you do find a way to have a real conversation with someone on the other side, approach it skillfully. One powerful opener is to point to a log in your own eye--to admit right up front that you or your side were wrong about something. Doing this at the start of a conversation signals that you aren't in combat mode. If you are open, trusting and generous, your partner is likely to reciprocate.Another powerful depolarizing move is praise, as we saw in the second Clinton-Trump debate. After more than 90 minutes of antagonism, a member of the town-hall audience brought the evening to a close with this question: ""Would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?""Mrs. Clinton began with weak praise by saying that she respects Mr. Trump's children. But then she made it strong and generous by noting how ""incredibly able"" those children are and how devoted they are to their father, adding, ""I think that says a lot about Donald."" Mr. Trump responded in kind: ""I will say this about Hillary. She doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up. I respect that.""That brief exchange was emotionally powerful--the only uplifting moment of the night for many viewers. Had it been the opening exchange, might the debate have been more elevated, more constructive?This has been a frightening year for many Americans. Questions about the durability, legitimacy and wisdom of our democracy have been raised, both here and abroad. But the true test of our democracy--and our love of country--will come on the day after the election. Starting next Wednesday, each of us must decide what kind of person we want to be and what kind of relationship we want to have with our politically estranged cousins.Dr. Haidt is a social psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business, a fellow at the Martin Prosperity Institute and the author of ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion.""

Trump Calls for New War on Terror --- GOP nominee says limits on immigrants needed to fight groups like Islamic State,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811510595?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump, expanding on the provocative immigration ideas that have propelled his presidential candidacy, proposed on Monday a new ideological test that would limit immigrants seeking admission to the U.S. to ""those who share our values and respect our people.""He argued in a speech fleshing out his plans to combat terrorism that tighter immigration standards were needed to fight Islamic State with the same vigor with which the U.S. fought the Cold War. ""We will be tough, and we will be even extreme,"" he said.It wasn't immediately clear what the test -- he called it ""extreme vetting,"" a phrase that didn't appear in his prepared remarks -- would include, but Mr. Trump suggested he would ban not only terrorist sympathizers but those who believe in Shariah law, don't believe in the U.S. Constitution or ""support bigotry and hatred."" Shariah law is the legal system of Islam that governs public and private behavior.The speech represented a response to Mr. Trump's critics, including many Republicans, who have expressed doubts that he has the experience and temperament to lead the U.S. in a dangerous world. Last week, 50 Republican foreign policy experts signed a statement saying they wouldn't vote for Mr. Trump because they question his capacity to serve as commander in chief.Democrats on Monday sought to rebut Mr. Trump even before he spoke. Appearing with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at a rally in Scranton, Pa., Vice President Joe Biden said Mr. Trump's comments had been quoted approvingly by the leader of Hezbollah and posed a threat to U.S. troops in the region. ""Trump is already making our country less safe,"" Mr. Biden said.""This man is totally, thoroughly unqualified to be president of the United States of America,"" Mr. Biden said of Mr. Trump. ""On every issue that matters most to our security, Donald Trump has no clue what it takes to lead this great country.""In his speech at Youngstown State University in Ohio, Mr. Trump unfurled a broad-gauge critique of the antiterrorism policies of President Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton, his former secretary of state.""The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton,"" he said. ""Our current strategy of nation building and regime change is a proven absolute failure.""He didn't go as far as he did last week when he claimed that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton were ""founders"" of ISIS. But he did say Mrs. Clinton ""lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS.""Although Mr. Trump blamed Mr. Obama for the instability in Iraq, former President George W. Bush started the withdrawal process in 2008 before leaving office, signing the initial agreement with the Iraqi government to pull out all U.S. troops by the end of 2011.The Obama administration tried to negotiate with the Iraqi government to keep roughly 10,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, but those talks collapsed over a question of legal immunity for American soldiers stationed there.Mr. Trump called for redefining the U.S. relationship with other nations by setting a new litmus test for allies: a desire to ""halt the spread of radical Islam.""""All actions should be oriented around this goal, and any country which shares this goal will be our ally,"" he said.Mr. Trump reiterated past suggestions that the U.S. could improve relations with Russia and find ""common ground"""" in the battle against ISIS. That comes at a time when his campaign manager is under scrutiny for ties to Russia and certain allies in Ukraine.The New York Times reported Monday that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had been designated to receive $12.7 million in cash payments for consultant work during the administration of Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian former president of Ukraine. Mr. Manafort denied receiving that money, but the Clinton campaign seized on the report as evidence of Mr. Manafort's ties to Russia.The speech included some notes of moderation: Mr. Trump backed down from past criticism of NATO, praising recent stepped-up antiterror measures.Although he spoke of an immigration crackdown, Mr. Trump didn't mention a proposal that remains on his campaign website to temporarily ban Muslims from the U.S. He instead struck a conciliatory note about working with ""moderate Muslim reformers."" And as he did after the attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando that left 49 people dead, Mr. Trump cast himself as a champion of the gay community, which is persecuted by Islamic State.Few of the policies he mentioned were significantly different from the antiterrorism strategy now being pursued. For example, Mr. Trump said he would join with allies in the Middle East to ""aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS, international cooperation to cut off their funding, expanded intelligence sharing, and cyberwarfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting."" The Pentagon is already pursuing all those approaches.The biggest departure in the speech came in his proposed new test for people seeking admission to the U.S., the latest variation of a proposal that has been central to his presidential campaign, but also one of its most controversial.He said that in addition to screening out would-be terrorists, anyone with hostile attitudes toward the U.S. would be barred. ""Only those who we expect to flourish in our country -- and to embrace a tolerant American society -- should be issued visas,"" he said.Immigration advocates attacked the idea for its potentially arbitrary application. ""Would someone who disagrees with his policies be considered an opponent of the American values he espouses?"" asked Ali Noorani, executive director of the liberal National Immigration Forum Action Fund.Bruce Hoffman, a professor who specializes in terrorism at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, raised practical questions about how government officials would be able to verify the accuracy of test responses. ""Does he think terrorists tell the truth?"" he asked.---Paul Sonne and Byron Tau contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook and Beth Reinhard",11/7/16
Trump's Anti-Terror Strategy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811510327?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump made another pivot back to the issues on Monday, this time laying out his strategy to fight radical Islam. As usual it included some good ideas and some bad, but if we're lucky he'll stick with the subject long enough to force Hillary Clinton to debate something other than his temperament.The polls show Mr. Trump still has a slight edge over the Democrat in fighting terror, thanks in large part to President Obama's eight-year record. Islamic State incubated in the vacuum left by American retreat in Iraq and Syria, and its poison has spread throughout the world. Mrs. Clinton is promising to continue Mr. Obama's strategy, which gives the Republican an opening.""The failure to establish a new Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq, and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal, surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS,"" Mr. Trump said as he read from a prepared text in Youngstown, Ohio. That's exactly right, though he should have added Mr. Obama's decision to let the Syrian civil war rage out of control.Then again, Mr. Trump has sometimes said the U.S. should stay out of Syria's civil war because it amounts to the ""nation-building"" that Mr. Trump again promised to end. That's a good applause line on the right and left these days, but setting up safe zones in Syria so millions of refugees won't flood Turkey, Jordan and Europe is a long way from nation-building. The U.S. did that for the Kurds after the first Gulf War, and the Kurdish territory of Iraq is a rare American success in the Middle East.If Mr. Obama had kept 10,000 U.S. troops in Iraq after 2011, the critics might have called that nation-building too. But it would have blocked the march of Islamic State and spared us from having to refight the war in Iraq today. Mr. Trump's caricature of nation-building is closer to Barack Obama's view than he would like to admit.The better news is that Mr. Trump seems to be warming to the idea that the U.S. needs coalitions to defeat radical Islam. Most notably, he reversed course on NATO in his speech, praising its role in fighting terrorism. He also called for ""an international conference"" on fighting radical Islam and he cited Israel, Egypt and Jordan as particular allies in the fight.Mr. Trump still seems naive in expecting Vladimir Putin's Russia to assist in this effort, but then so were Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton in 2009. Mr. Trump hasn't seemed to notice that Mr. Obama recently agreed to share intelligence with Russia in Syria over the vociferous objections of the Pentagon. The Republican nominee would have to learn the hard way that Mr. Putin is a hard man who only responds to the logic of hard geopolitical facts.More welcome is Mr. Trump's promise to conduct ""ideological warfare"" against Islamic State, making the analogy to the way Ronald Reagan told the truth about ""the evil empire"" during the Cold War. He said this will mean speaking out ""against the oppression of women, gays and people of different faith"" in the Muslim world.Perhaps most encouraging was his pledge that ""our Administration will be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East, and will amplify their voices."" This may seem obvious, but Mr. Obama has preferred to play down divisions in the Islamic world lest he offend the Muslim leaders he has courted in Turkey and Iran. Islamic State must be defeated on the battlefield, but it's good to see Mr. Trump recognize that the West needs to win the battle of ideas too.Yet on this point he contradicts his strategy by proposing a total ban on immigration from countries ""that have a history of exporting terrorism."" Mr. Trump calls it a ""temporary"" suspension until new screening procedures can be established. But he isn't clear when or how the ban would be lifted. No screening is fool-proof, and pledges of loyalty or other ideological tests can be gamed.The sweeping immigration ban might be read as anti-Muslim by the same allies Mr. Trump says we need to defeat Islamic State. Its breadth would also presumably apply to Coptic Christians in Egypt or Syria, Iraqi translators who helped U.S. troops, and perhaps even Israelis since some Israeli Arabs practice terrorism. Mr. Trump is right that Mr. Obama fails to stigmatize radical Islam, but then the Republican shouldn't stigmatize all refugees as potential security risks.The best message of the speech is that it means we might get a national-security debate this election year. The Clinton campaign is hoping to disqualify Mr. Trump as a potential President without having to confront the issues or her record as Secretary of State. Mr. Trump has trouble sticking to a message, but this is a debate the American public needs to hear.",11/7/16

In fact, the Obama administration has launched numerous attacks on ISIS in Iraq and Syria, harming the group.Radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Thursday if he meant to say that Mr. Obama indirectly created ISIS by creating a power vacuum in Iraq when he pulled most troops from the country. ""No,"" Mr. Trump replied. ""I meant he's the founder of ISIS.

""Everyone's liking it,"" he said.In a statement, Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan said: ""This is a false claim from a presidential candidate with an aversion to the truth and an unprecedented lack of knowledge.""A White House spokesman declined to comment.Asked in a CNBC interview how he plans to close the gap in recent polling that shows him falling behind in critical swing states, Mr. Trump said he didn't plan to change his campaigning style.""Just keep doing the same thing I'm doing right now,"" he said about his efforts to win the race.

As hundreds of people watched from the street and more followed televised and streaming video, police attempted to apprehend Mr. Rogata safely.They first tried to reach Mr. Rogata through a vent above him, but he maneuvered around them. Police then smashed a window to try to reach him, and later lowered a window-washing scaffold from the top of the building. Mr. Rogata refused to cooperate, police said, declining to grab hold of a rope they lowered to him.Officers in blue helmets finally managed to retrieve Mr. Rogata by leaning out of a window on the building's 21st floor and pulling him into the building, ending the spectacle at around 6:30 p.m.Mr. Rogata was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center for examination.

"Deep, Swift China Shock Drove Trump's Support --- Many U.S. areas are still suffering from aftermath of import boom; resentment in Hickory, N.C.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810711823?accountid=12768,"HICKORY, N.C. -- In the late 1990s, this furniture-making hub seemed sheltered from the disruptive forces of globalization. Laid-off steelworkers from West Virginia, Tennessee and beyond streamed here for new jobs building beds, tables and chairs for American homes. The unemployment rate fell below 2%.These days, Hickory is still suffering from a series of economic shocks, none more powerful than China's rise as an export power. The invasion of imported furniture drove factories out of business, erased thousands of jobs and helped drive unemployment above 15% in 2010.Stuart Shoun, 59 years old, has been laid off three times since 1999. After one layoff, the Hickory machinist studied architecture at a community college but then couldn't find a job and returned to the furniture industry. He makes $45,000 a year, the same as he did nearly 20 years ago and $14,000 a year poorer after adjusting for inflation.Mr. Shoun's son, Steven, a trained furniture upholsterer, manages a junkyard and discourages his own son, now in college, from working in the industry that gave North Carolina the nickname ""Furniture Capital of the World."" Steven Shoun says he blames ""the people who run our country and who run our companies"" for Hickory's economic turmoil.Mr. Shoun and his father say they favor Donald Trump for president, even though they don't plan to vote. ""I don't think one vote will make any difference,"" says Stuart Shoun.When import booms from Japan, Mexico and Asian ""tiger"" economies such as Taiwan arrived in the U.S., many cities and towns were able to adapt.China was different. Its emergence as a trade powerhouse rattled the American economy more violently than economists and policy makers anticipated at the time or realized for years later. The U.S. workforce adapted more slowly than expected.What happened with Chinese imports is an example of how much of the conventional wisdom about economics that held sway in the late 1990s, including the role of trade, technology and central banking, has since slowly unraveled.The aftershocks are sowing deep-seated political discontent this election year. Disillusionment with globalization has fed one of the most unconventional political seasons in modern history, with Bernie Sanders and especially Donald Trump tapping into potent anti-free-trade sentiment.Both presidential candidates aimed much of their criticism at 1994's North American Free Trade Agreement, which boosted imports from Mexico. Even then, though, the real culprit was China, economists now say.Many U.S. factories that moved to Mexico did so to match prices from China. Some of the new Mexican factories helped support U.S. jobs. For example, fabrics made in the U.S. are turned into clothing in Mexico for sale globally by U.S. companies.David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who has studied trade, labor markets and technological change, calls China's economy a ""500-ton boulder perched on a ledge."" At some point, it would tumble and splatter what was below, but ""you just didn't know when,"" he says.Economists have long argued that while free trade creates winners and losers, the net results are beneficial. Americans gained from inexpensive imports and filled their homes with low-price bicycles, jewelry and kitchenware. U.S. companies won access to overseas markets.Workers in industries exposed to imports were expected to upgrade their job skills or move somewhere offering fresh opportunities.Japan's invasion in the 1970s largely hit industries in cities with broad manufacturing bases on which to fall back. In Akron, Ohio, long the center of the U.S. tire industry, chemists trained at the University of Akron helped create a local polymer industry that employs tens of thousands of workers, said David Lieberth, a former Akron deputy mayor who chronicles the city's history.China upended many of those assumptions. No other country came close to its combination of a vast working-age population, super-low wages, government support, cheap currency and productivity gains.Imports from China as a percentage of U.S. economic output doubled within four years of China joining theWorld Trade Organization in 2001. Mexico took 12 years to do the same thing after Nafta. Japan took just as long after becoming a major U.S. supplier in 1974.By last year, imports from China equaled 2.7% of U.S. gross domestic product, a percentage point larger than Japan or Mexico ever won.Japan's import wave also challenged a limited group of advanced manufacturing industries, largely autos, steel and consumer electronics. China's low-cost imports swept the entire U.S., squeezing producers of electronics in San Jose, Calif., sporting goods in Orange County, Calif., jewelry in Providence, R.I., shoes in West Plains, Mo., toys in Murray, Ky., and lounge chairs in Tupelo, Miss., among many other industries and communities.""If we encouraged China to trade, we needed domestic policies in place that would minimize the impact that would follow,"" says Gordon Hanson, a University of California, San Diego economics professor. He calls the lack of such policies ""a catastrophic mistake.""A group of economists that includes Messrs. Hanson and Autor estimates that Chinese competition was responsible for 2.4 million jobs lost in the U.S. between 1999 and 2011. Total U.S. employment rose 2.1 million to 132.9 million in the same period.In the 2000s, congressional districts where competition from Chinese imports was rapidly increasing became more politically polarized, the two researchers and two coauthors concluded from examining vote totals. ""Ideologically strident"" candidates replaced moderates, they wrote in a paper.In this year's Republican presidential primary races,Mr. Trump won 89 of the 100 counties most affected by competition from China, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. Those counties include Hickory's Catawba County, where Mr. Trump got 44% of the Republican vote in the March primary against 11 other candidates.Mr. Sanders won Democratic primaries in 64 of the 100 most-exposed counties in northern and Midwestern states. That pattern didn't hold in the South, where Mrs. Clinton was strong among black voters.Hickory, a quiet city of about 40,000 people, used to have a smell redolent of wood lacquer. It was a boomtown in the late 1990s. Foreign competition challenged the local apparel industry, but furniture thrived.Furniture makers figured they were relatively safe from imports because their products were bulky, expensive to ship and often involved hand-craftsmanship. Then shipping costs fell, and many Americans chose low prices above all else.Manufacturing employment in Catawba County and surrounding areas shrank to 38,000 in 2014 from 79,000 in 2000. Nearly half the decline was caused by lost furniture jobs.Last year, total U.S. imports of furniture and fixtures from China reached $20.4 billion, up from $4.4 billion in 2000, the Census Bureau estimates. Especially hard hit were communities in North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Iowa and Wisconsin.The U.S. now imports 73.5% of all furniture it consumes, according to Jerry Epperson, an analyst at investment bank Mann, Armistead & Epperson Ltd. in Richmond, Va. More than half of that percentage comes from China.""We were all pretty surprised by the speed,"" says Alex Bernhardt Jr., chief executive of Bernhardt Furniture Co., a family-owned manufacturer based in Lenoir, N.C., about 17 miles from Hickory.Mr. Bernhardt and other furniture makers say they inadvertently helped China by dispatching technicians to its factories to offer guidance. American furniture companies also sent tools, parts and instructions to China to build intricate, machine-made products there.Alex Shuford, 42, the CEO of family-owned RHF Inc., which owns Century Furniture and is based in Hickory, says the help U.S. manufacturers gave China ""was like Ford helping Toyota.""Century and Bernhardt survived by focusing their U.S. production on made-to-order goods, especially upholstered furniture. Bernhardt now has 1,600 employees in North Carolina, down from 2,800 in 2000, while Century has shrunk to 845 workers in the state from 1,323 in 2003.U.S. policies to deal with Chinese trade failed, including efforts to collect import duties. In 2004, a coalition of furniture makers won a trade case against China and collected $309 million in tariffs.Stanley Furniture Co., of High Point, N.C., received the biggest payout, which totaled $83.5 million, but had just 71 workers left in the U.S. as of last year, compared with 2,600 a decade earlier. Stanley spent heavily on a U.S.-made line of children's furniture, but it flopped.""We invested millions in the effort to save jobs,"" says Stanley President and Chief Executive Glenn Prillaman.Stuart Shoun, the Hickory machinist, says he was a 20-year-old ""hillbilly"" in search of steady work when he moved to Hickory from Mountain City, Tenn., in 1977. Roads to jobs in Hickory were called the Hillbilly Highway.When layoffs hit, Mr. Shoun was surprised some coworkers asked for help deciphering instructions because they couldn't read or write. ""How would they even go and fill out [job] applications?"" he recalls thinking.He was recruited to run a furniture plant in China and could have doubled his salary to about $100,000.""The offer said to me: 'You might want to get out of North Carolina and go to China because that's where the industry is going,'"" he says. He didn't want to leave his family and turned down the job.During earlier import surges, American cities and workers remade themselves. Detroit rebounded from Japanese competition in the 1980s, with auto maker Chrysler and leader Lee Iacocca emerging as symbols of American revival. Chrysler is now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.Laid-off workers adjusted more slowly to the China shock. In Hickory and across the U.S., fewer uprooted themselves in search of job opportunities elsewhere, migration data show. Economists cite the increase in two-income families, the aging population, housing bust and skyrocketing housing costs in places such as San Francisco and Austin, Texas.Government efforts for laid-off workers haven't helped much. Washington's formal program to retrain workers hurt by import competition, called Trade Adjustment Assistance, pays for two years of college tuition and extends unemployment-insurance payouts.A 2012 evaluation ordered by the Labor Department found that program participants, especially those older than 50, generally made less money four years after starting the program than those who didn't sign up. The others went back to work more quickly.Mr. Shuford, Century's CEO, calls the job-relief program a ""Band-Aid for an economy that has a sliced artery.""In Hickory, laid-off workers went to community collegebut often came away without jobs in other industries. After losing his job in 2006, Mr. Shoun figured that learning architectural design would help him get a better job. The housing market collapsed by the time he finished his training in 2008. He went back to the furniture business.His ex-wife, Michelle Surratt,an eighth-grade dropoutwho lost her job in 2006, used Trade Adjustment Assistance to start earning a high-school diploma but never took the required math test because she was ""scared about numbers,"" she says.Ms. Surratt, 58, earns $9.69 an hour repairing furniture fabric. About 15 years ago, she made about $1 an hour more as a machine operator.Many workers figure they aren't cut out for college and turn to Social Security Disability after years of grinding factory work. Between 2000 and 2013, the number of Catawba County residents on disability rose 86%, compared with increases of 61% in North Carolina and 65% in the U.S.Anthony ""Tony"" Crawford, an upholsterer, tore a knee and hurt his back tripping over wooden frames on a furniture-factory floor in 2009. During the boom, he made $29 an hour and worked overtime shifts for more money.Mr. Crawford, 45, now lives on a fraction of his old income. ""I made my money with my hands,"" he says. ""Back to school wasn't an option.""In recent years, Hickory has shown signs of revival. The jobless rate was 5% in June, slightly higher than the U.S. Much of the improvement in Hickory's unemployment rate is due to the area's labor force shrinking by about 25,000 jobs, or 13%, since 2001. That means there are fewer people to count as unemployed.Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. have set up data centers, some on a stretch of U.S. 321 long called Furniture Row. Those operations don't employ many people. Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc.'s 48,000-square-foot data center has seven workers, according to county officials.Bernhardt, facing a shortage of skilled labor, now advertises for upholsterers at movie theaters and offers signing bonuses of $1,000.Mr. Autor, the MIT economist, says the worst is probably over now that wages in China are rising and production has begun shifting to lower-cost countries including Vietnam. That makes little difference to Hickory's furniture-industry casualties, few of whom are likely to regain the economic ground they lost.""What we heard was China, China, China,"" says Lonnie Joiner, Mr. Shoun's former boss. ""I blamed the large corporations and their greed.""Mr. Joiner says he supports Mr. Trump, who won him over with ""raw honesty and brashness"" and his tough talk on trade.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: The Problem Isn't China; It's U.S. Multinationals"" -- WSJ August 18, 2016)Credit: By Bob Davis and Jon Hilsenrath",11/7/16
Trump and Taxes: Don't Look Behind the Curtain,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810257796?accountid=12768,"Tax cuts, especially tax cuts heavily skewed toward the rich, have been a staple of Republican presidential politics since Ronald Reagan. They still are, even in this wackiest of political seasons, although Donald Trump's proposal is a moving target.As recently as the GOP convention, Mr. Trump was still bragging that ""I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race."" But on Monday, that tax plan disappeared from his website, and he sketched a new plan which, his advisers claimed, would cost about one-quarter to one-third as much as his old plan. Really? Stand by for further tweets.This week's Trump plan cuts the top income-tax bracket rates to just 33% for personal taxes and 15% for corporate taxes. Not even the Chamber of Commerce seeks a corporate tax rate that low. And just for fun -- fun for the super-rich, that is -- he'd abolish all estate and gift taxes.Though details are sorely lacking, Trump II resembles the House Republican plan. But here's one key difference. The House plan sets the tax rate on pass-through business income at 25%, thereby opening up a modest 8-point tax loophole (33% minus 25%) for wealthy business owners. Trump II makes the corresponding tax gap a whopping 18 points (33% minus 15%), thereby opening up a loophole wide enough to drive the whole Trump Organization through.Hillary Clinton opposes the Trump plan, of course, both for the revenue losses we can ill afford and because inequality is bad enough already. She proposes, instead, to increase taxes on the rich (incomes over $2 million a year) and the very rich (over $5 million). The Tax Policy Center estimates that her plan would raise about $1.1 trillion over 10 years, which is enough to pay for her proposed programs without blowing a hole in the budget. Nearly all the new revenue comes from the top 1%.So there's quite a difference. This aspect of the 2016 tax debate has a familiar ring. Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter would recognize it. So would Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.But a second tax debate is novel. It's the outcry over Mr. Trump's imperious refusal to release his tax returns -- something no candidate, Republican or Democrat, has done in the last 40 years. In stark contrast, Mrs. Clinton has released her tax returns dating all the way back to 1977. But Mr. Trump won't budge, telling ABC's George Stephanopoulos, for example, that his tax rate is ""none of your business.""Well, maybe it's none of Mr. Stephanopoulos's business. But it is the public's business -- for a number of good reasons including concerns about Mr. Trump's alleged Russian connections and letting voters make judgments about actual and potential conflicts of interest. Do Mr. Trump or his business partners owe anything to Russian oligarchs? How much would Mr. Trump and his family save if the Trump tax plan became law?Here's about all we know about The Donald's tax returns:-- He says he's under IRS audit for returns since 2009, which he won't release until the audits are complete. Have you ever waited for a reply from the IRS, even for a relatively simple matter? Can you imagine how complex Mr. Trump's tax returns must be? Do you think there's any chance the audits will be complete by Election Day?-- The IRS does not object to anyone releasing his tax information while under audit. To prove the point, Warren Buffett recently offered to do so -- if Trump will.-- Audits of Mr. Trump's returns prior to 2009 are history, yet he also refuses to release those.-- The last Trump tax returns to see the light of day, for 1978 and 1979, show he paid no taxes. They were unearthed by David Cay Johnston, the intrepid Pulitzer-prize-winning journalist, from filings with New Jersey casino regulators. According to a June report in Politico, also based on casino regulatory matters, the same was true of Mr. Trump's 1991 and 1993 returns. After that, the lights go out.-- The Donald claims to have given away millions to a host of charities. But after strenuous efforts, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold could document only one personal charitable donation since 2008 -- of between $5,000 and $10,000.All this leaves the impression that Mr. Trump is hiding behind the audit excuse because he doesn't want voters to know that he pays no income taxes, or that he lies about his charitable donations, or that he's on the hook to oligarchs tied to Vladimir Putin. Perhaps all three.These are just guesses, however. They could all be wrong. There is only one way to find out: Mr. Trump, take down that wall.---Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is an informal policy adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: A Responsible Candidate Would Hand Over Returns"" -- WSJ Aug. 18, 2016)Credit: By Alan S.

New Flap For Trump Over Gun Comments,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810257429?accountid=12768,"WILMINGTON, N.C. -- Donald Trump, confounding the hopes of Republicans who want him to run a more measured presidential campaign, touched off another firestorm Tuesday with an off-the-cuff remark that critics interpreted as inciting violence against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.His comments, before a packed basketball arena here, came a day after he delivered an economic-policy speech in a Detroit hotel ballroom that many Republicans saw as a disciplined reboot amid falling poll numbers including those released Tuesday in new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist polls.Speaking at his rally here about how he claims Mrs. Clinton as president would undermine gun rights under the Second Amendment, Mr. Trump said, ""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks."" He then added: ""Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know.""The Clinton campaign declared his remarks ""dangerous,"" charging that they amounted to a call for an attack against his opponent. The Trump team quickly said it was an awkwardly worded call to mobilize gun owners as a political force before the election.Still, the Secret Service, in a tweet Tuesday afternoon, said it was ""aware of the comments"" made earlier in the day.The latest flare-up over Mr. Trump's penchant for provocative remarks comes at a precarious time for the businessman's presidential bid. His standing in battleground states is slipping and GOP defections are continuing. On Tuesday, Maine Sen. Susan Collins announced she wouldn't support him.""He makes it harder every day to continue to support him,"" said Ryan Williams, a former aide to Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns who now works for the New Hampshire GOP. ""It's almost like he wants people to denounce him. He's basically asking for it at this point.""Mrs. Clinton has opened an 11-point lead in Pennsylvania and is inching ahead in closer races in Ohio and Iowa, according to the Journal/NBC/Marist polls.Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump among registered voters by 48% to 37% in Pennsylvania, where the Republican nominee will hold a campaign rally in Erie on Friday.She has improved her position in that state since a Journal/NBC/Marist poll last month, when she led 45% to 36%. In Ohio, Mrs. Clinton broke last month's tie and pulled ahead 43% to 38%, according to the new state poll. And in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton was ahead 41% to 37%, an edge little-changed from a month ago.The three states are central to the strategy of both campaigns, particularly Mr. Trump's, for winning the electoral college majority in November. The results are in keeping with recent national polls that have shown Mrs. Clinton enjoying an expanded national lead since the Democratic convention.It isn't yet clear how much of the poll movement reflects a post-convention ""bounce"" for Mrs. Clinton and how much it reflects voters drifting from Mr. Trump after he drew sustained criticism over a public debate with the Muslim-American parents of a fallen U.S. soldier and a non-endorsement of House Speaker Paul Ryan that he later reversed.Mr. Trump is hoping that, with his appeal to white working-class voters, he can make inroads in the Rust Belt where Republicans have struggled in recent years.Ohio and Iowa have swung between the parties in past elections, but both were won by President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Republicans haven't won Pennsylvania since 1988.""If he doesn't win those states, we will know very early on election night that this will be a rout,"" said Rick Tyler, former aide to GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz, a Texas senator.At the North Carolina rally, Mr. Trump tried to build momentum off Monday's economic policy speech, telling the crowd of thousands of people that Mrs. Clinton ""will double your taxes.""Mrs. Clinton has said she wouldn't raise taxes on families earning less than $250,000, and she has proposed targeted tax cuts for middle-class families, while wealthier people would see tax hikes.Mr. Trump threw out a series of unflattering adjectives to counter Mrs. Clinton's pitch that she would be a steady hand in the White House, calling her ""volcanic"" and ""inept.""""It's one thing to make bad decisions,"" Mr. Trump said of the former secretary of state and U.S. senator from New York. ""It's another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions.""Yet, Mr. Trump overshadowed all those messages with his extemporaneous comments on Mrs. Clinton and the ""Second Amendment people.""Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, called the comments ""dangerous.""""A person seeking to be the president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way,"" Mr. Mook said in a statement.Mr. Trump's campaign said the candidate was talking about gun owners mobilizing before the election, with spokesman Jason Miller saying in a statement in part: ""Second Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power.""Mr Trump, in a Tuesday night interview on Fox News, said he believed he was being clear about his attempt to motivate gun owners to back his campaign.""There can be no other interpretation,"" he said. ""I mean, give me a break.""National Rifle Association spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Mr. Trump was ""correct"" in saying Mrs. Clinton, if elected, would nominate ""an anti-gun Supreme Court justice.""Trump ally Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama said on CNN he didn't believe Mr. Trump meant to incite violence but that ""he shouldn't joke"" about such an issue.Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, said in an email that the comments were ""stunning"" and that Mr. Trump must recognize his new role as standard bearer of a national party.""At some point, a senior leader has to take responsibility not just for what they say, but for what people hear,"" Mr. Hayden said.---Reid J.

Trump Runs Against Both Parties,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1810257187?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump cleaned up one of his messes, endorsing the re-election of fellow Republicans Paul Ryan, Kelly Ayotte and John McCain. On Monday, he laid out a tax plan that GOPers are genetically predisposed to embrace.This assures us that Mr. Trump is not crazy in any clinical sense -- incapable of changing his approach and adapting to feedback from the environment.It only semi-assures us on another question. At least part of Mr. Trump is serious about being president -- or, anyway, about mounting a campaign that won't rebound disastrously on the GOP.Those who marinate in the hyperbole of the moment found Mr. Trump's bickering with the parents of a slain American soldier of a different order of personal dysfunction, recklessness and political tone-deafness than his threats against Jeff Bezos, his attack on Judge Curiel, his fake buddy act with Putin, etc.In fact, the back and forth with the Khans was distressingly normal compared with these other episodes. The Khans launched an unquestionably partisan attack (which does not mean it lacked substantive validity) in the most partisan of venues, a Democratic convention.For once the personal and political were united in one of the Donald's miscarriages. He may have been motivated by a personal slight but he wasn't politicizing the nonpolitical for personal or business reasons.Mr. Trump is still an outside chance to win the presidency. Those commentators who spend all their effort pronouncing him unacceptable -- and consigning to reputational hell any who quibble -- are letting down their fans. For voters the problem is a multidimensional one.If Mr. Trump isn't crazy, unstable or irrational, then he's merely unpresentable. A Hillary presidency may be preferable if Mrs. Clinton's only path to presidential achievement is through a Republican Congress. But a possible outcome is all the levers landing in the hands of Democrats who believe nothing is wrong with America that more regulation and redistribution can't fix. Read the Washington Post's chilling account of how her campaign gestated Mrs. Clinton's ""detailed and complicated economic policy agenda."" Try not to think of Ira Magaziner's health-care task force in 1993.In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign has been a promise to make America great again -- not a laundry list. It's reassuringly likely that his most ill-advised and headline-grabbing policy pronouncements mean nothing. That's a plus.He tells an excitable part of the electorate what it wants to hear, on guns, trade and immigration. When you tell the public untruths, in Mr. Trump's understanding of business, that's marketing.His overwhelming goal, he has said, is to make sure his rallies aren't boring. His rallies aren't window-dressing -- they are his campaign, unlike any traditional candidate. He calculates that a large and sufficiently enthusiastic minority can produce a turnout tsunami to swamp the anti-Trump majority who are content to sit at home and yell at the TV.What's more, his $62 million in small donations reveal that his fans are not ready just to shout down hecklers and make rude suggestions about Hillary. They are willing to reach into their pockets.Mr. Trump's faults are glaring, but he's not the maniac with his finger on the nuclear button of the latest Democratic ads, aimed at a disengaged, conformist section of the electorate looking for a stark characterization to latch onto. The ads may be effective but they are a complete misreading of a 70-year-old family man who turned the family business from real-estate development to branding because it was less risky.In the last week, however, we have also been reminded what to expect when Mr. Trump decides the wave has carried him as far as it can. Republicans wish it weren't so, but he's been running against them as much as against the Democrats.He began last week by withholding his blessing from GOP colleagues like Messrs. Ryan and McCain. He tested out the theory, as he did during the primaries, that any failure on his part can only be due to a ""rigged"" system.When he decides the wave has been played out, Mr. Trump can serve up this analysis to his fans, blaming defeat on a corrupt and criminal elite of both parties, and many will buy it. Their allegiance and enthusiasm, to Mr. Trump, will be capital in the bank, to be deployed later in the ever-evolving mission of Donald Trump to advance the celebrity and grandeur of Donald Trump.The word ""un-American"" has been rightly used -- not for Mr. Trump or his ideas, but for the uncharacteristic willingness of the American voter to opt knowingly for a bunkum artist as long as he says the right things about American renewal.Mr. Trump, bless him, has left voters in no doubt about who he is. He's not George Washington any more than he's the nuclear madman of Democratic ads. If mainstream Democrats or Republicans don't pick up on the Trumpian hunger of Americans for leadership, they're the ones who are crazy and incapable of adapting to feedback.Credit: By Holman W.

Will Obama's Cuba Policy Lose Florida for Clinton? Exiles who oppose normalization could give Trump the state's 29 electoral votes.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836701100?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are in a statistical dead heat in Florida, where the state's 29 electoral votes will be pivotal in Tuesday's presidential election. One surprise for Democrats is that President Obama's December 2014 decision to liberalize U.S. Cuba policy is not helping their nominee as the White House expected it to. Instead, it has become a liability.Mr. Obama and Democrats bet big on the hypothesis that the traditional hard-line approach to dealing with the Castro regime, which encouraged the Cuban diaspora of the 1960s, '70s and '80s, is passe. And that new generations of Cuban-Americans, either U.S. born or more-recently arrived, favor economic and political engagement with the regime.By spinning the president's more-liberal travel policy to the island as an opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of Cuban change, the administration also hoped to gin up enthusiasm in Miami for his kinder, gentler attitude toward the communist military dictatorship. Mr. Obama's detente with Cuba was supposed to be a political winner.Just 23 months later that theory is being tested.Cuban-Americans who initially supported Mr. Obama's outreach are increasingly disillusioned with an administration strategy that helps the Castros but leaves out the Cuban people. This could affect turnout among left-of-center voters who care about human rights.The Obama policy also seems to be energizing greater numbers of conservative and independent Cuban-Americans to rally behind the Republican candidate. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll released on Oct. 30 had the New York real-estate developer leading Mrs. Clinton 52% to 42% among Cuban-Americans. Some read this as a result of recent Trump efforts in south Florida to make himself a champion of Cuban exiles. But it is more likely a rise in the protest vote.The U.S. trade embargo, which dates to 1962, was codified into U.S. law in 1996. Lifting it requires congressional approval. But Mr. Obama has normalized relations with Havana, a step aimed at lending legitimacy to the gangster government. He also has used an executive order to liberalize U.S. travel to Cuba and has licensed some U.S. hotels to operate on the island.The administration's public explanation for the change was that economic engagement with Cuba would hasten the fall of the dictatorship.A less charitable reading of Mr. Obama's motivations suggests that he harbors ideological sympathy for the Cuban Revolution and believes that the Castros would treat Cubans humanely if only the U.S. would demonstrate tolerance for tropical totalitarianism.Regardless of which narrative you prefer, the president badly miscalculated. Even his supporters have noticed.A July 1 column in the Miami Herald by Cuban-born Fabiola Santiago, who described herself as having been a supporter ""of the president's policy of engagement with the goal of improving the lives of the Cuban people,"" captured the disillusionment. Ms. Santiago was particularly peeved about the opening of the Four Points Sheraton Havana, ""brought to you, American traveler, by the people who repress Cubans.""The columnist explained that the Obama opening was sold as a path that would allow American companies to partner in joint ventures with Cuban entrepreneurs. Instead, she wrote, referring to Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which owns Sheraton, ""the American hospitality giant is in business with the Cuban military, which owns the hotel."" As she observed, that changes nothing. ""We're only shifting from the Castro brothers and family personally enriching themselves through totalitarian rule to the repressive military now doing exactly the same thing.""Ms. Santiago quoted the similar sentiments of Richard Blanco, the Cuban-American poet who was tapped to read at the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Havana in August 2015: ""How will [the goal of bringing prosperity to the Cuban people] be realized if basically they are doing what other foreign investors have done, namely, strike a deal with the government that leaves the ordinary Cubans in the same situation? How is this any better, simply because it's the U.S.?""If this is how supporters are assessing Mr. Obama's Cuba project, it's not hard to picture Cuban-Americans who either took a wait-and-see approach, or oppose the Obama policy, viewing this election as a chance to vote against it in order to aid their Cuban brethren. By pledging to stick with the policy, Mrs. Clinton has made herself a target.The Cuban economy is in tatters and the regime is backtracking on promises of reform. Human-rights groups say that beatings and detentions of dissidents have soared since the U.S. extended the olive branch. Yet Mr. Obama keeps making concessions to the Castros, as he did on Oct. 14 when he authorized further sanctions relief.No matter who wins on Tuesday, the next president will have to clean up this Cuba mess. Decent Cuban-Americans on both sides of the aisle want answers.Write to O'Grady@wsj.com.Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady",11/8/16
Don't Believe the Economic Pessimists; Memo to Clinton and Trump: The U.S. economy can and will grow faster with the right policies.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836486222?accountid=12768,"No matter who wins Tuesday's presidential election, now ought to be the time that policy makers in Washington come together to tackle America's greatest economic problem: sclerotic growth. The recession ended more than seven years ago. Unemployment has returned to normal levels. Yet gross domestic product is rising at half its postwar average rate. Achieving better growth is possible, but it will require deep structural reforms.The policy worthies have said for eight years: stimulus today, structural reform tomorrow. Now it's tomorrow, but novel excuses for stimulus keep coming. ""Secular stagnation"" or ""hysteresis"" account for slow growth. Prosperity demands more borrowing and spending--even on bridges to nowhere--or deliberate inflation or negative interest rates. Others advocate surrender. More growth is impossible. Accept and manage mediocrity.But for those willing to recognize the simple lessons of history, slow growth is not hard to diagnose or to cure. The U.S. economy suffers from complex, arbitrary and politicized regulation. The ridiculous tax system and badly structured social programs discourage work and investment. Even internet giants are now running to Washington for regulatory favors.If you think robust growth is impossible, consider a serious growth-oriented policy program--one that could even satisfy many of the left's desires.* Taxes. The ideal tax system raises revenue for the government while distorting economic decisions as little as possible. A pure tax on consumption, with no corporate, income, estate, or other taxes is pretty close to that ideal.The U.S. tax system is the opposite: By exempting lots of income, the government raises relatively little money. Yet an extra dollar is heavily taxed, greatly lowering incentives and encouraging people to find or create exemptions. This massive complexity and obscurity undermine faith in the system.Progressives, ponder this: With a sales tax of only 25%, the government would likely have gotten a lot more money from Donald Trump--who has employed complex but legal tax-avoidance schemes--than it did by purporting to tax income at high rates.* Regulation. U.S. regulation is arbitrary, slow, discretionary and politicized. Speak out on the wrong side of the party in power and some federal agency will be after you.Imagine a deep rule-of-law regulatory reform, along the lines proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""Better Way"" plan. Congress must review and approve major regulations. People and businesses have a right to see evidence and appeal. Regulators face a shot clock--no more years and years of delays on decisions. Agencies must conduct serious, transparent and retrospective cost-benefit analysis.Imagine a similar deep reform of state and local restrictions including zoning laws and occupational-licensing regulations.* Social programs. When many people earn an extra dollar, they lose more than a dollar of benefits. If we fixed these disincentives, more Americans would work--and fewer would need benefits.* Health. Replace ObamaCare with a simple health-insurance voucher. Deregulate insurance and entry into health care dramatically.* Finance. Replace strangling regulation of financial companies with a simple rule: If you issue enough equity that stockholders bear the risks, you can do what you want. Rep. Jeb Hensarling has proposed such legislation. Hearty competition is the best consumer protection.* Labor. The best worker protection is a worker's ability to swiftly change jobs. This is more likely if employers do not face a mountain of red tape, complex rules and legal liability.* Immigration and trade. The politically incorrect truth: Allowing Americans to buy from the best supplier and permitting people who want to work and start businesses to immigrate is good for the economy. Trying to impoverish China will not revive America.* Education. Let lower-income Americans get a decent education from charter schools and vouchers.* Energy. Trade all the crony subsidies and credits and regulations for a simple uniform revenue-neutral carbon tax. The country will have more growth and less carbon.It would take an entrenched obtuseness to claim such a program cannot substantially improve economic output and incomes. If you claim such good policy cannot help, then it follows that bad policies do not hurt. Nativism, trade barriers, overregulation, legal capture, high taxes, controlled markets and people excluded from work won't hurt our slow but positive growth. Don't give populists cover to try it again.If you object that such good policy is politically infeasible, then you at least grant that robust growth is economically possible. And small steps help. Current bipartisan proposals to reform taxes, Social Security, immigration, the regulatory state and trade agreements would go a long way to reviving growth. Have a bit more faith in democracy.On the other hand, the major party presidential candidates' signature plans--child-care tax credits, college subsidies, higher taxes on people who don't hire good enough lawyers; threatening a trade war and deporting millions of unauthorized immigrants--cannot revive substantial growth.So why is there so little talk of serious growth-oriented policy? Regulated and protected industries and unions, and the politicians who extract support from them in return for favors, will lose enormously. The global policy elite, steeped in Keynesian demand management for the economy as a whole, and microregulation of individual businesses, are intellectually unprepared for the hard project of ""structural reform""--fixing the entire economy by cleaning up the thousands of little messes. Even economists fight to protect outdated skills.Mr. Cochrane is a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution and an adjunct scholar of the Cato Institute.Credit: By John H. Cochrane",11/8/16
"Whoever Wins, Capitalism Will Survive; Don't despair. Trump or Clinton may be a dismal choice. But the U.S. economy is resilient.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1836486212?accountid=12768,"As Americans prepare to make what many see as a depressing choice between presidential candidates, they shouldn't despair. Yes, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton don't sound like wise stewards of economic policy. And yes, we have some problems that need serious attention, such as a badly distorted credit market and an unworkable Affordable Care Act. But the American capitalist economy has become extremely powerful and can most likely withstand further abuse, however unwelcome.It was not always thus. In the 1930s, a much smaller, heavily agrarian American economy was in danger of falling victim to statism. The ""Great Depression"" began in 1929 with a downturn in the business-credit cycle that precipitated a stock-market crash. The market was recovering in 1930 but the real economy didn't rebound as it had after a similar crash in 1920.New Deal historians called what happened a ""crisis of capitalism."" In fact, capitalism was doing great in the 1920s. Henry Ford was cranking out Model Ts that almost anyone could afford. Housewives were buying labor-saving tools like electric vacuums and washing machines on the installment plan. Fat Sears and Montgomery Ward catalogs offered the bounty of capitalism to dwellers in even the remotest farm houses.It was public policy that deepened an ordinary recession and prolonged it for a decade. The Depression was a demonstration of what happens when the government responds to a downturn with excessive interference with market forces.The seeds of the Depression were planted with the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, in a two-year interval in which President Woodrow Wilson had a compliant Democratic Congress. The act set up 12 regional government banks to make preferential loans to farmers. Farmers had done well earlier, so much so that years later they would ask the government to support prices on a parity with the year 1912. But the 1916 government venture damaged country banks with unfair competition and encouraged farmers to overproduce. That lowered prices.Calvin Coolidge fended off their demands for relief from low prices but Herbert Hoover refinanced the FFLA, suggesting that he was an easier mark than Coolidge. After the 1929 crash, farmers again pressured the Republican Congress for relief, prompting Sen. Reed Smoot of Utah and Rep. Willis C. Hawley of Oregon to draft a bill raising tariffs on farm products. Had Congress stopped there the damage would have been limited. But lobbyists for industry and labor demanded protection as well. The final Smoot-Hawley bill doubled already-high tariffs on 20,000 dutiable items to an average of 50% of value.Ignoring his own better instincts and a petition signed by more than 1,000 economists, Hoover signed Smoot-Hawley into law. The sharp drop-off in trade that resulted sent prices plummeting, worsening what was already a deflationary cycle caused by the loss of liquidity in the crash. Europeans were inhibited from selling goods in the U.S. to earn dollars to buy U.S. products and pay their war debts. The reduced flow of funds worsened deflation. Europe's retaliation with tariff increases made matters worse. A global money shortage ensued.U.S. exports nose-dived to $1.7 billion in 1933 from $5.2 billion in 1929, with farmers--big exporters even then--hit the hardest. Democrats swept the 1932 elections but instead of giving the country less market interference they gave it more.The most egregious was the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, which required businesses to adopt 557 ""codes"" to prevent price cutting. These cartels violated the key principle that market competition is the guarantor of a vigorous, efficient economy. The NIRA veered the U.S. close to European-style fascism, which had many admirers at that time. Fortunately, the Supreme Court put it out of its misery in 1935, declaring it an unconstitutional extension of government power.Despite Smoot-Hawley, the New Deal's revolutionary farm production quotas, the NIRA and FDR's attacks on capitalism, the business cycle turned upward in 1933. Unemployment fell from nearly a quarter of the labor force that year to 17% in 1936. But then the ""second New Deal"" Congress slapped a tax on ""surplus"" business profits, the equivalent of a tax on job-creating investment. The market crashed again in 1937 and took the economy with it.In 1940 FDR, to his credit, realized that to rearm a militarily weak America he badly needed the capitalists he had spurned and often reviled. He made peace with them and they responded magnificently, especially after Japan's December 1941 attack, quickly mobilizing their factories to perform amazing feats of weapons production.That performance, plus the defeat and discrediting of fascists Hitler and Mussolini and the outset of the Cold War with ultra-statist Stalin gave Americans a new appreciation for market capitalism. Largely unfettered in the postwar era, privately owned corporations produced the technological marvels and high living standards we enjoy today.The system is under threat again. But it is far stronger now than it was in the 1930s. History is not on the side of the statists.Cheer up, if you can.Mr. Melloan, a former deputy editor of the Journal editorial page, is the author of ""When the New Deal Came to Town,"" out this week from Simon & Schuster.Credit: By George Melloan",11/8/16
Election 2016: Trump Again Hits Media,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811264031?accountid=12768,"Corrections & AmplificationsThe first name of U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) was misspelled as Clare in an Election 2016 article Monday about Donald Trump and the media.(WSJ August 16, 2016)Beset by sagging poll numbers, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is stepping up his attacks on news organizations, suggesting that biased coverage is turning the election against him.In speeches, tweets and TV appearances, Mr. Trump and his backers in recent days suggested he would be ahead in the polls if the media didn't favor his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.""If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%,"" Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday.Mr. Trump is under pressure from many in the GOP to steer his campaign beyond his signature incendiary comments and toward substance that might broaden his appeal. Mr. Trump is planning a foreign-policy speech in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday, and on Tuesday he is scheduled to hold an event in Milwaukee, site of weekend violence over a police shooting.But Mr. Trump's bumpy past couple of weeks, reflected in his worsening poll numbers, illustrate how his controversial statements are now playing differently than they did in the crowded GOP primary race. Just in the past week, Mr. Trump charged repeatedly that President Barack Obama was ""the founder"" of Islamic State and encouraged ""Second Amendment people"" to take unspecified action against Mrs. Clinton and the judges she might appoint if she wins the White House.A CBS News poll released Sunday found that 45% of likely voters in New Hampshire supported Mrs. Clinton, compared with 36% backing Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton held a 45% to 40% lead in Florida.The CBS poll followed a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll of registered voters last week that gave Mrs. Clinton a sizable edge in Colorado, Virginia and North Carolina and a smaller advantage in Florida.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Democratic Sen. Clare McCaskill of Missouri referred to the Trump campaign as a ""dumpster fire.""The Trump campaign blamed setbacks on the media, turning that argument into a fundraising pitch. ""You've seen it -- the liberal media can't stop telling outrageous lies about me,"" Mr. Trump wrote in an email Friday asking backers to contribute money.Mr. Trump has routinely called reporters ""very bad people."" But over the weekend, he and his aides upped the volume. Saturday, he threatened to yank the campaign press credentials from the New York Times over an article saying his campaign is in disarray.Campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Sunday there has been a failure to cover Mr. Trump's policy proposals. ""Donald Trump in the course of this week was very substantive,"" he said on CNN.---Julian Routh contributed to this article.Credit: By Michael M. Phillips",11/8/16
Trump's Self-Reckoning,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811261237?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump lashed out at the media on Sunday after more stories describing dysfunction inside his presidential campaign. ""If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%,"" Mr. Trump averred on Twitter.Mr. Trump is right that most of the media want him to lose, but then that was also true of George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. It's true of every Republican presidential nominee. The difference is that Mr. Trump has made it so easy for the media and his opponents.The latest stories comport with what we also hear from sources close to the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump's advisers and his family want the candidate to deliver a consistent message making the case for change. They'd like him to be disciplined. They want him to focus on growing the economy and raising incomes and fighting terrorism.They think he should make the election a referendum on Hillary Clinton, not on himself. And they'd like him to spend a little time each day -- a half hour even -- studying the issues he'll need to understand if he becomes President.Is that so hard? Apparently so. Mr. Trump prefers to watch the cable shows rather than read a briefing paper. He thinks the same shoot-from-the-lip style that won over a plurality of GOP primary voters can persuade other Republicans and independents who worry if he has the temperament to be Commander in Chief.He also thinks the crowds at his campaign rallies are a substitute for the lack of a field organization and digital turnout strategy. And he thinks that Twitter and social media can make up for being outspent $100 million to zero in battleground states.By now it should be obvious that none of this is working. It's obvious to many of his advisers, who are the sources for the news stories about dysfunction. They may be covering for themselves, but this is what happens in failing campaigns. The difference is that the recriminations typically start in October, not mid-August.These stories are appearing now because the polls show that Mr. Trump is on the path to losing a winnable race. He is now losing in every key battleground state, some like New Hampshire by double digits. The Midwest industrial states he claimed he would put into play -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania -- have turned sharply toward Mrs. Clinton.More ominously, states won by John McCain and Mitt Romney are much closer than they should be. If Mr. Trump is fighting to hold Georgia, Arizona and even Utah by September, a landslide defeat becomes all too possible.The tragedy is that this is happening in a year when Republicans should win. The political scientist Alan Abramowitz has spent years developing his ""time for a change"" forecasting model. The model looks at the rate of GDP growth in the second quarter of an election year (1.2% this year), the incumbent President's approval rating, and the electorate's desire for change after one party has held the White House for eight years.No model is perfect, but Mr. Abramowitz's has predicted the winner of the major-party popular vote in every presidential election since 1988. His model predicts that Mr. Trump should win a narrow victory with 51.4%. A mainstream GOP candidate who runs a reasonably competent campaign would have about a 66% chance of victory.Mr. Trump has alienated his party and he isn't running a competent campaign. Mrs. Clinton is the second most unpopular presidential nominee in history -- after Mr. Trump. But rather than reassure voters and try to repair his image, the New Yorker has spent the last three weeks giving his critics more ammunition.Even with more than 80 days left, Mr. Trump's window for a turnaround is closing. The ""Trump pivot"" always seemed implausible given his lifelong instincts and habits, but Mr. Trump promised Republicans. ""At some point I'll be so presidential that you people will be so bored, and I'll come back as a presidential person, and instead of 10,000 people I'll have about 150 people and they'll say, boy, he really looks presidential,"" he said in April.Those who sold Mr. Trump to GOP voters as the man who could defeat Hillary Clinton now face a moment of truth. Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, Paul Manafort and the talk-radio right told Republicans their man could rise to the occasion.If they can't get Mr. Trump to change his act by Labor Day, the GOP will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the Senate and House and other down-ballot races. As for Mr. Trump, he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be President -- or turn the nomination over to Mike Pence.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: The Trump Effect on the Republican Party"" -- WSJ Aug. 19, 2016)",11/8/16

Kashkari: Fed Must 'Wait and See' How Trump Presidency Will Affect Economy; Minneapolis Fed chief says the central bank needs to work to be more open and explain its role to the public,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837392013?accountid=12768,"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said the central bank will have to ""wait and see"" to determine the impact of Donald Trump's presidency on the economy, in a town hall appearance Wednesday in Eau Claire, Wis.When it comes to the impact on monetary policy, Mr. Kashkari said that ""we're going to have to wait and see what Congress and the executive branch decide to do."" He said the Fed's commitment is to fulfill its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.Regarding how Mr. Trump's spending plans could affect the U.S. central bank's monetary policy, Mr. Kashkari said that ""regardless of who the president is, that's an input into our economic analysis.""He said the central bank would monitor the impact of fiscal policy as it sets monetary policy, noting that fiscal decisions are outside Fed control.He didn't comment on whether the central bank would raise interest rates in December but said he is focused on economic data to decide when the Fed should next make a move. The Federal Reserve hasn't raised rates since December, when it set its target for the federal-funds rate at 0.25% to 0.5%. The central bank hinted after its November policy meeting that it was closer to moving on a rate increase at its final meeting later this year.Mr. Kashkari isn't a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, but will become one in 2017.Mr. Kashkari also responded to a question about the public's distrust of the central bank that appeared to bubble up during the election, saying that he thinks the Fed's inscrutability, especially during the crisis, led to a lot of ""anger and mistrust."" He said the Fed needs to work to be more open and explain its role to the public.He also defended the central bank. ""The Fed is really a remarkable institution,"" he said. ""We attract people committed to public service, people who love their country, who want to do the right thing for our region and country.""If the Fed can be less inscrutable, he said, ""I think we can earn that trust back again.""Mr. Kashkari was careful not to directly address the impact of the election results, citing the Fed's commitment to maintaining its independence from politics. But, when asked what advice he would give to the new administration, he said more broadly he would suggest focusing on factors creating headwinds in the U.S. economy that monetary policy alone can't solve.Specifically, Mr. Kashkari mentioned ways for the government to address the impact of lower fertility rates on shifting demographics that could be contributing to weaker productivity growth. He said the public has to decide if it wants to accept slower growth, implement child-care-friendly policies that encourage having children or embrace immigration. ""That's not for the Fed,"" he said. ""That's for the public to ultimately decide.""Mr. Kashkari said he expects more of the same ""sluggish"" growth from the U.S. economy. He attributed the relatively weak recovery in the U.S. since the recession to demographic shifts and slower productivity growth. While he said he doesn't see big engines of growth moving forward, he also doesn't see headwinds.Write to Shayndi Raice at shayndi.raice@wsj.comCredit: By Shayndi Raice",11/9/16
Trucking Group Starts Meeting With Donald Trump's Transition Team; The industry prepares for a possible new look at regulations due to hit operators next year,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837349168?accountid=12768,"Trucking companies greeted Donald Trump's election with hope for more highway spending and a reprieve from proposed safety regulations.The American Trucking Associations, the largest group representing trucking companies in Washington, said Wednesday it has already started meeting with the Donald Trump transition team as the industry prepares for a possible new look at regulations due to hit operators next year.Trucking companies are preparing to meet a Dec. 31, 2017, deadline to equip all trucks with electronic logging devices measuring their hours on the road. The rule has divided segments of the industry, with smaller truckers complaining about the cost and shipping customers arguing that it will drive some companies out of business and leave bigger operators free to raise prices.ATA chief Chris Spears said in a statement that the group hopes to work ""closely with the new administration on issues that will allow the trucking industry to continue to grow and move America forward.""Covenant Transportation Group Inc. Chief Financial Officer Richard Cribbs said he anticipated ""less uncertainty about governmental infrastructure spending."" Mr. Trump has proposed increasing spending on roads and bridges one issue that the president-elect and Democrat Hillary Clinton largely agreed on during the campaign.Shares in trucking company stocks, which generally had been rising in the days before the election, largely were moving upward in early trading Wednesday. Landstar System Inc., a Jacksonville, Fla., carrier specializing in industrial transport, was a leading early gainer, with shares rising 3.7% to $77.65, nearly a two-year high. Covenant shares were up 2% at $18.27.A group representing independent truckers and small fleet owners was more skeptical about the potential for greater infrastructure investment. Mr. Trump's campaign recently released a framework for spending on roads and bridges that would include privatization of highways to draw corporate investment.""You wouldn't have the highway system now if they were for-profit things. The public is not well served by private roads,"" said Todd Spencer, an executive vice president at the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, which represents 158,000 independent drivers and small companies that operate only a handful of trucks.He cited the Indiana Toll Road as an example. The 157-mile stretch of Interstate 90 in Indiana was turned over to private management in 2006 for $3.8 billion. The management company filed for bankruptcy protection in the wake of the financial crisis after declining interstate commerce led to reduced traffic and lower toll collections.However, Mr. Spencer said he viewed the election ""as an opportunity to hit the reset button"" when it comes to regulation.The group is focused on a pending requirement for speed limiters on trucks, guidelines issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for medical fitness for truckers and the looming mandate for electronic logging devices.""We certainly think the regulatory onslaught that's targeting trucks needs a review,"" said Mr. Spencer.Loretta Chao contributed to this article.Write to Paul Page at paul.page@wsj.comCredit: By Paul Page",11/9/16
Trump and the Yen: Making Things Uncomfortable for Japan; A stronger yen would complicate Japan's efforts to keep the yield on 10-year government bonds at zero,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837185834?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's victory isn't what dollar bulls wanted. Nor is it what Japan needed.The Japanese yen took a sharp turn Wednesday as odds that Republican candidate Donald Trump would be the next president of the U.S. built up. The yen strengthened more than 3% before paring some gains. That comes after weeks of hovering around a more comfortable level for Japan's policy makers.A stronger yen would unwind what happened after the Bank of Japan's moves in September to control the government-bond yield curve. Yields on Japanese government bonds fell after the election results came in. Signs of any trouble keeping the 0% target on 10-year bonds could lead to forced tightening or reducing government-bond purchases, far from what the economy is prepared for.A crucial issue facing markets and Japan in particular, is whether Mr. Trump reignites a rerun of trade tensions from the 1990s. Should trade turbulence, weakness in U.S. stocks and investors' hankering for safe assets all pick up, Japanese investors and companies will rush to hedge their dollar exposures. Yen-hedging demand is close to its highest on record already, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. The inevitable result: an even stronger yen.This dynamic was a key factor when the Bill Clinton administration was on the brink of a trade war with Japan two decades ago. The yen strengthened 20% during a two-year spat over luxury-car tariffs. For a country that runs a trade surplus and is a large holder of U.S. financial assets, this poses a big threat.Then there is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which still had an outside chance of passing before Tuesday's result. Now, the 12-nation trade treaty, which could have catapulted reforms inside Japan's economy, seems destined for the dustbin.Unlike the yen's almost 7% swing on the day of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, the moves Wednesday weren't as outsize.The trouble is the yen could track a slow and painful path stronger. Treasurys dropped Tuesday as longer-end Japanese government bonds rose, narrowing the differential between the rates. The Federal Reserve may be less likely to raise rates in December.Even as uncertainty over policy looms large, the yen's path appears more certain.Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.comCredit: By Anjani Trivedi",11/9/16
Green Elites Face Trump Threat,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837156574?accountid=12768,"Whatever you think of Donald Trump, his candidacy represents an important opportunity. It's a chance to dismiss a very particular elite about whom it could be said, borrowing from Cromwell, ""For any good you have been doing . . . in the name of God, go!""We are referring, of course, to America's green-energy elite.With a Hillary Clinton victory on Tuesday, America's ludicrous Tesla subsidies would be certain to continue -- because so many Democratic politicians aligned with the company, especially in California, are themselves too big to fail.Washington's Kafkaesque fuel mileage rules would only become more Kafkaesque. By forcing car makers and their customers to invest in economically unjustified fuel-saving technology, they've already perversely contributed to last summer's breaking of a decade-old record for miles traveled and fuel burned.Ethanol's alleged greenhouse benefits have long since been scientifically debunked. Its putative contribution to America's ""energy security"" has been rendered a joke by the fracking revolution. Never mind. Corn farmers like a handout, and corn-state senators like being re-elected. The cost to American motorists: $10 billion a year.And making sure it remains so -- we hardly needed the latest WikiLeaks dump to tell us -- have been a handful of activist hedge-fund billionaires like Tom Steyer and Nat Simons. In the recent dump of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, we see these men, in return for being willing to write four-figure checks to Democratic candidates, fishing for reassurance that policies that cost the American people billions, with no benefits, will be embraced by the next Democratic administration.We see climate saints like Bill McKibben and Joe Romm conspiring at their behest to silence a scientist for saying perfectly accurate things about the lack of evidence for a worsening of extreme weather events. We see Mr. Podesta himself trying to orchestrate a media mugging of liberal Harvard Law Prof. Larry Tribe for representing the coal industry.And to what end, exactly?Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, is hardly a green-energy naysayer. Yet last week he estimated that even if electric vehicles accounted for half of global auto sales (currently EVs account for less than 1%), oil consumption would nevertheless continue to rise because the ""demand growth is not coming from cars, it's from trucks, aviation and the petrochemical industry and we don't have major alternatives to oil products there.""Mr. Birol politely failed to mention that the climate effect would also be nil, because these electric cars would be running on coal. China, the world's biggest consumer of electric vehicles, fires up a new coal plant at the rate of one or two per week and will do so for years to come.President Obama's ""clean power plan,"" costing upward of $200 billion over the next 15 years, will have no discernible effect on temperatures even a century hence. A catastrophic idiocy has informed Europe's favoritism toward diesel cars: In return for trivial CO2 gains, it got dirtier air in its cities. The Nature Conservancy, in a 2009 study, finds that even a modest U.S cap-and-trade program of the sort preached by greenies would require ""an area larger than the state of Nebraska"" for biofuels, wind and solar.And still the effect would be meaningless: A 100% cut in U.S. emissions, by the standard climate sensitivity estimate, would influence temperatures by less than 0.2 degrees centigrade a century from now.Even a carbon tax -- the sensible policy -- would offer no help unless the technological possibility already exists of meeting human needs with alternative energy at a price competitive with fossil fuels. If so, such technology will be forthcoming anyway for market reasons.All this might be terrifically worrisome if climate change fears were soundly established by science. They aren't. Al Gore-like forecasts of doom rely on doubtful computer simulations. As the International Panel on Climate Change delicately phrases it, numerous possible paths for future temperature are in rough ""agreement with observations."" This is a roundabout way of saying that the observations have been unable to discern an effect, if any, of human-scale emissions on global temperature.But then policies in a democracy are not sustained by their rationale. They are sustained by vested interests. Mr. Trump may be rude, crude, and largely visionless to boot. Yet purely by virtue of being out of sympathy with such elites his election would go a long way to de-corrupting America at least as far as energy policy is concerned.We could still hope for action from Hillary Clinton on tax reform and other worthwhile pieces of the American agenda, but we will have missed an opportunity in this election to rein in perhaps the most dishonest, self-serving interest group of any in the American pageant.Credit: By Holman W.

Trump Hits Reset Button,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812108325?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's second overhaul of his presidential campaign staff in as many months is an effort to remake his organization more in his own image, after trying -- and struggling -- to conform to the role of a traditional politician guided by political operatives.Some Republicans welcomed the addition of new senior staff to Mr. Trump's team, hoping it would bring a dramatic change to his faltering trajectory in opinion polls against Democrat Hillary Clinton. But some in the GOP also said they were worried that Mr. Trump couldn't recover lost ground by choosing a provocative media entrepreneur who has never run a campaign to lead his team.In keeping with his expressed desire in recent days to be himself, Mr. Trump has brought in as his campaign's CEO Stephen Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a conservative media outlet that delights in bashing the GOP establishment.""I'm going to do whatever it takes and do it the way I think will win,"" Mr. Trump said in a Tuesday night interview with The Wall Street Journal.The addition represents a potential setback for Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's efforts to tailor Mr. Trump into a more traditional political figure, and could portend more of the combative, off-the-cuff style that helped Mr. Trump win the GOP nomination. Mr. Trump recently has grown frustrated and angry about assertions that he had to become a ""puppet,"" according to advisers.Mr. Trump ""won't be as wild as during the primaries or as buttoned-up as the political pros want. He'll be the combination that's authentic to him,"" one adviser said.Kellyanne Conway, a pollster who Mr. Trump promoted to the position of campaign manager, brings expertise that could help address some of the campaign's weaknesses. Over the years, she has sought to expand the GOP's appeal to women, a group Mr. Trump is struggling to win over. She also is adept at the kinds of data-driven voter-targeting and analytics that the campaign has eschewed.Trump skeptics say that staff changes will accomplish nothing if the candidate himself doesn't turn the focus away from his own controversial statements and personality and onto Mrs. Clinton.""As long as they can make this a referendum on Hillary Clinton's record and getting the country back on track, I don't care who is running the campaign,"" said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member from Mississippi. ""I don't think we've had a lot of success with that in the last couple weeks. . . . It can't be a referendum on Donald Trump, and that's what it's become.""Some Trump supporters saw the staff additions as an appropriate capstone to a week that saw Mr. Trump delivering a series of more-scripted policy speeches on economics, foreign policy and law enforcement, with fewer distracting miscues.""There's already been a dramatic change just in the last eight days,"" said Gary Bauer, a social conservative who supports Mr. Trump. ""I think the campaign is on the right track.""Mrs. Clinton and her allies said Wednesday that the staff changes suggest that Mr. Trump is not making the long-discussed ""pivot"" to a more presidential style.""No matter how much the establishment wants to clean Donald Trump up, get him on a teleprompter and get him on message, he has officially won the fight to let Trump be Trump,"" said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.Mr. Bannon will take a leave of absence from Breitbart, which has cheered Mr. Trump's call for restrictive immigration policies and rebukes of GOP leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan. The former Goldman Sachs investment banker, naval officer and documentary filmmaker recently wrote and produced the movie ""Clinton Cash,"" based on a book about the Clinton family's wealth.Rick Tyler, a former aide to Trump primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, voiced doubts about whether Mr. Bannon's style is appropriate for a general election campaign.""Bannon is a take-no-prisoners, show-no-mercy, bare-knuckles brawler, which is great for his segment of the conservative base,"" Mr. Tyler said. ""But I thought Trump already has the Breitbart crowd. . . . Your job now is to appeal to people watching from home.""A fresh round of polls in pivotal swing states on Wednesday brought more evidence of Mr. Trump's troubles. Mrs. Clinton leads by 10 points in Colorado and 12 in Virginia, according to Quinnipiac University.Along with making staff changes, Mr. Trump is taking steps aimed at running the campaign more as a business than a political operation. In recent weeks, he moved his campaign from its original fifth-floor digs in Trump Tower, furnished with folding tables and chairs, to a more traditional corporate space on the 14th floor, with plush carpeting, mahogany paneling, plasma TVs and corner offices furnished with heavy desks.After summoning Messrs. Bannon and Manafort to his residence at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., on Sunday, Mr. Trump made clear he wanted the campaign run the way he has run his business and his brand. ""I want to win,"" Mr. Trump said in the Journal interview, in explaining his moves.Mr. Trump's campaign has been shaken since the Republican convention by, among other things, his feud with the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who died in Iraq.The restructuring of Mr. Trump's campaign comes just days before he plans to begin airing his first television ads of the general election. That was a relief to Republicans who worry he has gone too long allowing Mrs. Clinton to dominate the airwaves. ""The most positive thing I've seen is that they are going to get on TV Friday,"" said Ed Rollins, a veteran GOP political consultant. ""They are about a month late on that front.""---Beth Reinhard and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Monica Langley and Janet Hook",11/9/16
Law and Order: Trump Unit,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812102474?accountid=12768,"Richard Nixon, law and order's most famous practitioner, used the reality of domestic unrest to defeat Hubert Humphrey in the annus horribilis, 1968. President George W. Bush persuaded voters in 2004 that John Kerry would provide uncertain leadership in the post-9/11 war on terror.Donald Trump, always willing to test the limits of any thought, is campaigning for law and order on a global scale. He's accusing Hillary Clinton of being soft on crime at home and soft on terror everywhere in the world. It's ""Law and Order: Global Victims Unit,"" Donald J. Trump producer.Tuesday in Milwaukee, which last weekend looked a lot like Baltimore's 2015 street riots, Mr. Trump said: ""The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most. There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members and felons to prey on innocent people. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe.""In Monday's foreign policy speech he pledged to do a reverse-Obama by keeping Gitmo open and trying accused terrorists in military tribunals. Likening his strategy to ""the effort to take down the mafia,"" he said ""this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country.""With most of the battleground states looking more like Republican burial grounds, it may be pressing the membrane of believability to say the Trump law-and-order strategy just might work. That said, Mr. Trump's naming this week of the adept Republican political strategist Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager means he may yet give his supporters a competitive presidential campaign.Democrats deserve to have a Trumpian version of ""law and order"" unloaded on them. I don't think the Democrats are soft on crime and terrorism. They're just ambivalent. Ambivalence can get you killed, especially around people with guns and bombs.Asked after every primary to rank four issues, Democrats nearly always put terrorism fourth. It hardly came up in the Clinton-Sanders debates.And whether the domestic shooters are San Bernardino's terrorists, Orlando's nut or Chicago's gangs, the Democrats' offer the same silver bullet: gun control.The problem with how they've teed up the cops has been the nonexistence of any Democratic alternative beyond patrolling the toughest streets with a blue version of Casper the Friendly Ghost.On national security, an example of progressive foreign policy's half-in, half-out attitude was former Attorney General Eric Holder's remark in May that the traitorous Edward Snowden ""actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made."" No, it was not worth anything.In a Journal article last month, an administration official summarized the Obama anti-terror policy. It reads like aggression with footnotes:""Not just in Afghanistan, but in Iraq and Syria, it's very evident what his approach is, which is to make sure we're doing everything necessary to disrupt and ultimately defeat terrorist networks while significantly reducing the role of the U.S. military in terms of the ground presence and also reducing the resources associated with that presence.""There is a specific, well-known reason for a Democratic policy of ""reducing the resources associated with that presence,"" one that 50 former Bush officials should have thought about before unfurling their Hamlet-like statement last week on the election and national security.The reason is guns versus butter, military spending versus always unsated domestic needs. The liberals' battle for butter began in the 1960s, when they vilified Lyndon Johnson for spending on Vietnam and the Cold War rather than the Great Society.Right now, foreign-policy liberals and some conservatives are pushing sotto voce assurances that Hillary will ""get it right"" on national security. They had better go line-by-line through the economic-policy speech she gave last week in Michigan. After the greatest outlay on infrastructure spending ""since World War II,"" tuition-free college for the middle class and ""debt-free for everyone,"" plus uncountable tax credits, anything Mrs. Clinton gets right will be on the cheap. Like her ""intelligence surge.""This isn't Bill Clinton's center-left Democratic Party. It's the left-only party of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama. What they want is butter, lakes of it. Anti-terrorism gets to tread water, alongside the cops.Defeating Islamic terror is a rare unifying issue for conservatives and indeed for the world. Unlike any conceivable Democratic president, Donald Trump is at least willing to lead this battle, reflecting the truth that it won't happen without active, unrelenting U.S. leadership.No doubt this is yet another issue with which voters have to struggle, wanting an alternative to the Obama-Clinton Democrats but burdened with misgivings that are of Mr. Trump's own creation.But Donald Trump didn't create the law-and-order issue. Cities and nations under assault did that. Just now, his answer for both looks better than her answer.---Write henninger@wsj.com.Credit: By Daniel Henninger",11/9/16
Trump Will Be Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812102416?accountid=12768,"In any diagnosis of Donald Trump's campaign troubles, the idea that the candidate has been too constrained wouldn't be our first guess. But Mr. Trump is now telling the world that he is shaking up his campaign to unleash undiluted Donald in the last 80 days.""Everyone talks about, 'Oh, you've got to pivot,'"" Mr. Trump told a Wisconsin TV station on Tuesday. ""I don't want to pivot. I don't want to change. You have to be you. If you start pivoting, you're not being honest with people."" He said this hours before he added two new senior advisers, whose job is help rescue what has been a sinking candidacy.One new hire, pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager, is encouraging. Ms. Conway is one of the best people in politics, a sincere conservative with a talent for finding the language to connect with voters who aren't policy wonks or political addicts. During the GOP primaries she ran a Super PAC associated with Ted Cruz, but everyone makes mistakes. She has also advised Mike Pence, the GOP vice presidential candidate, and she has been the Trump campaign's best TV spokesperson by far in the last several weeks.Less encouraging is the arrival of Stephen Bannon of Breitbart News as chief executive for campaign operations. Breitbart has been called Mr. Trump's Pravda, but Pravda is more subtle. The website specializes in attacking -- often in nasty personal terms -- Republicans who refuse to assail immigration and trade.Breitbart led the campaign to defeat House Speaker Paul Ryan in his Wisconsin primary this month. ""Paul Ryan Bows Down to Nationalist Populism as His Career Flashes Before His Eyes,"" said one headline. Mr. Ryan won 84% of the vote.Mr. Bannon wants Mr. Trump to run the way he did in the primaries as an unabashed populist and nationalist. We thought Mr. Trump's problem is that he hadn't changed from the primaries, that he hadn't tried to reach out to skeptical independents and Republicans, that he hadn't until recently broadened his message beyond trade and immigration. But maybe Mr. Bannon sees a path to 270 electoral votes that others don't.Then again, the essential truth about presidential campaigns is that they always reflect the candidates, for better or worse. The Trump campaign's make-it-up-as-you-go operation, its emphasis on personal branding over policy, and its minimal attention to organization are all a reflection of Donald Trump's management style and political choices.So at least it's truth in advertising that Mr. Trump wants to run as unfiltered Trump from here to November. The voters will be able to see what they'd get in the Oval Office, and if he loses Mr. Trump would know, even if he didn't admit it, that he is the man responsible.",11/9/16
Shuffling Deck Chairs on the USS Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812102307?accountid=12768,"In the movie ""City Slickers,"" Jack Palance tells Billy Crystal that the secret of life is ""One thing, just one thing. You stick to that, and everything else don't mean s---."" When Mr. Crystal asks what that ""one thing"" is, the old cowboy replies, ""That's what you gotta figure out.""As Donald Trump shakes up his campaign's management team for the second time in two months, maybe the new crowd -- and, more importantly, Mr. Trump -- will finally figure out that the ""one thing"" of a presidential campaign is message discipline. Without it, Mr. Trump has caused controversy after controversy, generating loads of dreadful media coverage.Since the Republican convention in July, Mr. Trump has delivered two major policy addresses. But by themselves, speeches are not nearly enough. They must be part of a comprehensive narrative that explains his views in depth, contrasts them with Hillary Clinton's, and leads swing and undecided voters to his side. The same story must be delivered by the candidate's appearances, advocates, advertising and other campaign activity. That's not happening.Take last week's economic address in Detroit. Delivered from a teleprompter, it was generally well received. Mr. Trump outlined his agenda in broad terms, covering tax reform, trade agreements, a moratorium on new regulations and increased domestic energy production.He should have spent subsequent days fleshing it out. For example, he could have devoted Tuesday to explaining how tax reform would create jobs and Wednesday to visiting families hurt by ObamaCare. On Thursday, after Mrs. Clinton's own economic speech called for new ""infrastructure"" spending, Mr. Trump could have mocked her ideas as a return of President Obama's failed 2009 stimulus package. Then on Friday he could have appeared with workers angry about unfair trade practices. This kind of schedule would have presented Mr. Trump with a mix of different backgrounds and surrogates in support of his theme. That's how a successful campaign does things.Instead, Mr. Trump lost control of the narrative with his erratic utterances. On Tuesday he told a rally that ""Second Amendment people"" might prevent a future President Hillary Clinton from filling Supreme Court vacancies. On Wednesday he advanced a blame-the-press story line, calling the coverage of him ""disgusting"" and ""incredibly dishonest."" The same day, he claimed Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton were the ""founder"" and ""co-founder"" of Islamic State. By Friday he was insisting that his remarks were ""sarcastic."" (They were not.) A week that was supposed to be devoted to economics turned into a disaster.This week has so far proceeded along the same lines. Mr. Trump started Monday with a teleprompter speech on Islamic terrorism that generated good coverage. By Tuesday he had dropped terrorism and changed the subject. Hillary Clinton, he told a Wisconsin rally, ""is against the police, believe me."" But voters are not in a believing mood. They want proof.Instead of unsettling sound bites, Mr. Trump should offer a sustained attack on the policies and failings of Mrs. Clinton -- backed with evidence. He should explain how he will put the country on the right track. Even if he does everything right from here on, given his terrible mistakes so far, he may well lose in November. But if he doesn't change tactics now, he is likely to be wiped out.The new Team Trump should decide what message it wants Americans to hear each day. Then it must craft language and events to present that message, and convince the candidate to stick to it. The focus ought to be on the 20% of voters who are undecided or have moved reluctantly toward Mrs. Clinton, not the nearly 40% already committed to Mr. Trump.He should also stop punching back at everyone who strikes at him. Mr. Trump's opponents know that they can get him off balance by needling him on inconsequential items. He might try to prove them wrong occasionally. For example, 70 prominent Republicans sent an Aug. 12 letter to the party's chairman, Reince Priebus, urging the GOP to stop funding Donald Trump's campaign and focus on saving its House and Senate majorities. Rather than ignoring or playing down the letter, Mr. Trump grabbed headlines by telling Fox News that if the party cut off funding, he would follow suit: ""All I have to do is stop funding the Republican Party.""Did those comments help move a single swing voter into his corner? Convince anyone that Mr. Trump was on their side? No. And he's not funding the GOP anyway.The main problem with the Trump campaign has been Mr. Trump. He is an unguided missile, prone to veer of course and hit friendly forces. If his newly installed team was recruited to ""Let Trump Be Trump"" because they believe his attacks and populism have been too muted, then an epic loss could be the result.---Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of ""The Triumph of William McKinley"" (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Credit: By Karl Rove",11/9/16
Trump Overhauls Campaign Team --- Nominee adds two managers to help stem slide; Manafort remains chairman,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811731034?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is bringing two new managers to the top of his campaign in a bid to recover ground he has lost in recent weeks.Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News LLC, an outspoken Trump supporter and a former Goldman Sachs banker, will assume the new position of campaign chief executive. At the same time, Mr. Trump also is promoting Kellyanne Conway, a veteran GOP pollster and strategist, to become campaign manager. Ms. Conway has been a campaign adviser for several weeks.Longtime Republican operative Paul Manafort, who joined the campaign late in the primary season, remains campaign chairman. But the reset is designed to bulk up a structure that many Republicans have complained wasn't adequate for the rigors of the general-election campaign.Mr. Trump's campaign has fallen further behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in most national and battleground-state polls in recent days, and some Republicans had been hoping for a course adjustment before the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the general-election race.""I want to win,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview Tuesday night in which he disclosed his hires. ""That's why I'm bringing on fantastic people who know how to win and love to win.""Mr. Trump's campaign has been shaken since the Republican national convention by, among other things, controversies over his feud with the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who died in Iraq, and his assertion that President Barack Obama was the ""founder"" of the Islamic State. That prompted GOP officials to criticize their nominee for going off script and to urge him to construct a more disciplined campaign.Mr. Trump initially held to his unorthodox style and structure, arguing that they succeeded in winning the nomination. In recent days, however, Mr. Trump has been working behind the scenes to get more of what he called ""firepower"" atop his thinly staffed campaign organization, advisers said. On Sunday at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Trump, who sought out Mr. Bannon, met with him and Mr. Manafort to lay out his new thinking for the campaign team.In recent days, Mr. Manafort has been the subject of numerous news reports about the work he did for a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia. Mr. Manafort will remain an influential strategist, but the group of top advisers at the campaign widens with the new additions.Separately, in a campaign meeting on Monday, Mr. Trump, his advisers and family members discussed the need for the candidate and campaign to stay on message to avoid giving foes ""ammunition against him,"" one person familiar with the situation said. That afternoon, Mr. Trump delivered a speech laying out an antiterrorism strategy in which he largely stuck to his teleprompter script.On Tuesday night Mr. Trump delivered a speech on law and order in Wisconsin, introduced by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a onetime rival.It isn't entirely clear what changes the new management will bring, though they are expected to ramp up digital and advertising efforts.Mr. Trump said he would begin ""substantial advertising"" this Friday. ""Hillary Clinton has spent $100 million on ads, and I've spent nothing,"" Mr. Trump said. ""But I've raised a lot of money and put in my own money, and now I'm going to start ads in three days.""In addition, the new team is likely to beef up campaign work in polling and analytics, areas of strength for Mr. Bannon and Ms. Conway, advisers said.The appointment of Mr. Bannon is likely to stir its own controversy. Breitbart News, which he runs, is a freewheeling populist news site that has served as a kind of platform for Trump supporters. He has, among other things, helped produce a movie about the personal wealth of Bill and Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump has known Mr. Bannon, a former Naval officer, for years. Mr. Bannon will take a leave of absence from Breitbart.Ms. Conway recently joined the Trump campaign after working for a super PAC that supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, but Mr. Trump wanted to promote her and liked the idea of elevating a woman as his campaign manager, one aide said. She is likely to travel frequently with the candidate.The additions to the Trump team represent the second time it has undergone a significant change at the top in recent weeks. Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was fired at the end of June, and his responsibilities were largely assumed by Mr. Manafort.Credit: By Monica Langley",11/9/16

Trump's Victory: Scale of U.S. Market Lends Trump Clout,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837531102?accountid=12768,"WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump's plan to remake the global trading system depends on his ability to use the size and power of the U.S. economy to force other nations to make concessions.The New York businessman has many tools to reverse the post-World War II consensus on liberalizing U.S. trade without needing congressional approval. For instance, he can withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, as he has threatened to do, by simply notifying the U.S.'s Nafta partners, Mexico and Canada, and waiting six months.He could invoke a similar provision to withdraw from the World Trade Organization, which sets rules for global trading and enforces tariffs.Mr. Trump's advisers have said they doubt the U.S. would actually have to go that far. They believe the threat of losing access to the U.S. market would be leverage enough to force trading partners to make the changes the U.S. sought.The president has an arsenal of weapons he can use to impose the will of the U.S. in international economics. They include provisions of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the Trade Act of 1974, which can be used to limit imports and boost tariffs, wrote Peterson Institute for International Economics trade analyst Gary Hufbauer in September. Another law, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, was used by the Nixon administration in 1971 to impose a 10% import surcharge.While such measures would likely be challenged in court by U.S. importers, Mr. Hufbauer wrote, the administration would likely prevail.Whether or not the U.S. would come out ahead in a trade conflict is another matter. The U.S. is the world's largest economy and its share of global gross domestic product has held fairly steady from 26% in 1980 to 25% this year, according to the WTO. China's economy has soared from 3% of global GDP in 1980 to 15%.That reduces U.S. sway over global economic issues.The U.S.'s reliance on consumer spending to power its economy also reduces its ability to prosecute a trade war.Credit: By Bob Davis",11/10/16
"Trump's Victory: In North Carolina, Race for Governor Too Close to Call",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837531086?accountid=12768,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- The winner of North Carolina governor's race likely won't be declared for 10 days or more. Election officials are scrambling to sort through outstanding ballots in a contest where roughly 5,000 votes out of 4.7 million cast separate the two contenders.Democrat Roy Cooper claimed victory early Wednesday, noting ""the people of North Carolina have spoken.""But Republican incumbent Pat McCrory's campaign said the race isn't over as ""tens of thousands"" of ballots are yet to be counted, including mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day and provisional ballots.Overall, Republicans had a big night in state governors' mansions on Tuesday, picking up governorships in typically Democratic states like New Hampshire and Vermont.Political analysts predicted that once results are certified, the GOP advantage in governorships would grow to 33-16 over Democrats, from 31-18. Alaska has an independent as governor.In North Carolina, Donald Trump and Sen. Richard Burr won handily and Republicans managed to take statewide seats like treasurer and lieutenant governor.Mr. McCrory did comparatively poorly in the state's two biggest metropolitan areas, losing by more than 100,000 votes in both his home base of Charlotte in Mecklenburg County, and Raleigh in Wake County.The governor narrowly carried both counties in 2012. This time around, many voters in metro areas said they soured on Mr. McCrory for his championing of a law restricting public bathroom use by transgender people.Next, county canvassers likely will sort through roughly 10,000 absentee votes, as well as about 30,000 provisional votes from people who recently moved or who registered too recently to be reflected in the voting rolls, said Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the North Carolina legislature and an expert on state election law.Democrats are pinning their hopes on the fact that many provisional ballots are typically filed on college campuses and big cities, he said.Although Republicans tend to hold a historic advantage in absentee voting, the Democratic nominee Mr. Cooper has been doing comparatively well in that category so far this cycle, Mr. Cohen said.Mr. McCrory's backers say he is likely to ask for a recount after the provisional and absentee votes are counted, if the margin stays less than 10,000 votes.County elections officials meet Nov. 18 to begin certifying results, and a recount request must be made no later than Nov. 22, according to state law.""Claiming an outcome before the process has concluded is irresponsible and disrespectful to the voters of North Carolina whose voices have yet to be heard,"" said McCrory campaign consultant Chris LaCivita in a statement.The state GOP said Wednesday it is dispatching ""dozens of teams of lawyers"" in order to ensure that every vote is counted.State Chairman Robin Hayes said the party is ""confident that once all votes are counted, North Carolina will continue to prosper under four more years of Pat McCrory's leadership.""North Carolina has recent experience with a similarly close statewide race.In 2012, Republican Dan Forest led Democrat Linda Coleman narrowly on election night and by about 6,900 votes after elections officials certified results two weeks later.

Siemens Warns of Populist Threat to Business as Profit Jumps; Chief executive looks forward to 'trust-based' dealings with Trump administration,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837516019?accountid=12768,"MUNICH--The chief executive of Siemens AG warned that rising populism is a threat facing business and the global economy as the German industrial giant reported a 20% increase in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.Joe Kaeser singled out the populist political movements on the rise in Europe, including the referendum vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union, and the problem of mass migration.""The rapid rise of political and social populism and accelerating global migration are causes of concern,"" Mr. Kaeser said.The Siemens CEO said he didn't see the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president in the same vein as some of the populist movements that have swept through Europe.""Siemens congratulates Mr. Trump on his victory,"" Mr. Kaeser said at the start of his remarks. ""We're looking forward to continuing our trust-based cooperation with the new U.S. administration,"" he said.Siemens is a heavy investor in the U.S. and has expanded rapidly in the energy sector in recent years.The company said strong underlying growth at most of its industrial business divisions contributed to the jump in net profit to [euro]1.15 billion ($1.25 billion) in the three months to end-September from [euro]959 million in the same period a year earlier. The figure fell short of the average of analysts' forecasts for net profit of [euro]1.26 billion.Revenue rose 3%, to [euro]21.95 billion, helped by strong growth at the power and gas division. Revenue growth in that business was mainly a result of the ""strong execution"" of a large order backlog, including a [euro]8 billion power generation deal with Egypt, the company said.All of the company's industrial business divisions were profitable, with the exception of the process industries and drives unit, which produces automation technology, industrial software and other components for manufacturers. The division posted a [euro]72 million loss on weaknesses in the oil and gas and other commodity markets, and related severance charges.Siemens's consistently lucrative health-care division benefited from strong earnings from its diagnostic-imaging business. Remaining profitable will require continued investment in new technologies, the company said, as it confirmed a long-expected plans to publicly list the unit.Siemens last year legally separated the health-care division in anticipation of a possible flotation. The company said the timing of the listing would depend on the stock market environment, while Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas indicated Siemens could keep a majority stake in the business.Siemens outlined its guidance for fiscal year 2017, saying it expects a profit margin for its industrial business in a range of 10.5% to 11.5%, compared with 10.8% in fiscal 2016.Siemens proposed a dividend of [euro]3.6 a share for fiscal 2016, up from [euro]3.5 a share in fiscal 2015.Write to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.comCredit: By Christopher Alessi",11/10/16

"Post-Election Goldman Algo Tweak Boosts Volumes at Open; Firm normally executes less than 10% of client order flow in opening auctions, but adjusted algo to around 25% in wake of Trump win",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837447362?accountid=12768,"An unusual decision by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. contributed to huge trading volumes when stock markets opened Wednesday.The firm ""front-loaded"" an unusually large proportion of client orders, two people familiar with the situation said.The people said Goldman injected an abnormally large amount of client orders into the opening auction at 9:30 a.m. Exchange run such auctions each morning to rectify imbalances between buy and sell orders that come in overnight and determine the opening price of each stock.Goldman's move involved a tweak to its volume-weighted average price, or VWAP, algorithm. Banks often use such algorithms to get their clients the best price for large stock trades. The process involves breaking up big orders into batches and executing them throughout the day, timing the trades so more of them are fired off at times of greater trading volume. That helps minimize the impact of each trade on the stock's price.Normally Goldman would execute less than 10% of its client order flow in opening auctions, but in the wake of Donald Trump's surprise election victory it adjusted its algorithm to do around 25% at the open, one of the people said.The bank told its clients ""we have a Special Volume Profile today (in other words, a 'front-loaded VWAP' curve for our algos) due to the anticipated heightened liquidity around the open,"" in a note reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Trump's unexpected win caused stock-market futures to plunge overnight before a dramatic reversal when markets opened Wednesday. The S&P 500 seesawed wildly in the first two hours of trading and then ended the day with a gain of 1.1%.The New York Stock Exchange said 81 million shares were traded at the open on Wednesday, compared with the daily average in October of 35 million.Write to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.comCredit: By Alexander Osipovich and Corrie Driebusch",11/10/16
New Zealand Central Bank Cuts Rates Amid Trump Uncertainty; RBNZ says policy may need to adjust to international unknowns,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837405933?accountid=12768,"SYDNEY--The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered interest rates Thursday, becoming the first central bank to respond to heightened global market volatility in the wake of Donald Trump's unexpected U.S. election win.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's benchmark interest rate now sits at a record low of 1.75%, down from 2.0%. The move was expected by all 10 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.RBNZ Gov. Graeme Wheeler made it clear he is worried about market instability and U.S. political upheavals, saying they could trigger further rate cuts.""Political uncertainty remains heightened and market volatility is elevated,"" Mr. Wheeler said.""Numerous uncertainties remain, particularly in respect of the international outlook, and policy may need to adjust accordingly.""In addressing reporters later, Mr. Wheeler said the decision had occurred ""in light of the U.S. election results and reaffirmed that it was the right decision.""The rate cut was well telegraphed to markets, with the RBNZ frustrated that consumer prices have refused to respond to repeated interest-rate cuts this year. Still, some economists said that the U.S. political shift would cement the case for lower rates.Citigroup economist Joshua Williamson said the RBNZ has adopted a ""Trump Put,"" meaning if economic conditions weaken due to uncertainty in the world economy, it can cut again.But in the absence of that downside risk, the RBNZ has indicated it doesn't need to cut further as the economy is growing solidly, he added.Donald Trump became the U.S. president-elect Tuesday, surprising pollsters who had widely predicted Hillary Clinton would instead be heading to the White House.Mr. Trump's win kicked of a wave of market instability as investors wait to see how he will govern. New Zealand's economy, which is commodity-based and highly reliant on trade, is in the firing line if global trade agreements are ripped up by the Trump administration.Inflation remains well below the RBNZ 1% to 3% target range at a revised 0.4% in the third quarter. But economic growth has accelerated, dairy prices are climbing, and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in almost eight years.The New Zealand dollar was initially higher following the interest-rate cut, before falling back to be little changed.Write to James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.comCredit: By James Glynn",11/10/16

"Pharma Stocks Benefit From U.S. Election Result, but Relief May Be Fleeting; Several drug companies say it is too early to predict how the Trump presidency will affect the industry",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837226761?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's defeat in Tuesday's presidential election has one industry breathing a sigh of relief, at least for now: pharmaceuticals.Drug-company stocks were among the rare risers in Europe, and in U.S. pre-market trade, Wednesday, as the threat of a Clinton-led crackdown on drug prices in the U.S. evaporated.Mrs. Clinton had presented detailed plans to keep a lid on drug-price rises in the U.S., an issue that has drawn intense political and public scrutiny recently. Her proposals included penalties for ""unjustified"" price increases on older treatments and a cap on some patients' monthly and annual out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.Those plans, and repeated promises throughout her campaign to take on drug prices, had a chilling effect on drug stocks since she first voiced her intentions in a single tweet more than a year ago.Also boosting pharmaceutical stocks Wednesday is the failure of a motion aimed at capping drug prices for certain federal drug plans in California.Still, any relief for pharmaceutical investors could be short-lived: Donald Trump also took aim at high drug prices during his campaign, hinting at measures such as re-importation of drugs and giving Medicare powers to negotiate drug prices to limit price rises.What's more, prices for some types of drugs already are under pressure from the powerful companies that negotiate prices on behalf of insurance plans and employers. Those companies, known as pharmacy-benefit managers, already have forced price cuts for insulin and some respiratory drugs.Even so, Novo Nordisk A/S, which has taken a hammering from flat or falling insulin prices in recent months, was one of the strongest risers Wednesday afternoon. It was trading up nearly 4% at 234 Danish kroner, after climbing as much as 8% in early trade.Several pharmaceutical companies said it was too early to predict how the Trump presidency would affect the industry.""On the one hand there is campaign rhetoric, and on the other there are the issues the successful candidate prioritizes, and the need for actions to be ratified by Congress,"" said a spokesman for Novo Nordisk. ""We will therefore await concrete proposals.""Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.comCredit: By Denise Roland",11/10/16
Election 2016: Trump Seeking Hard-to-Reach Prizes,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812102639?accountid=12768,"WEST BEND, Wis. -- Donald Trump brought his campaign to Wisconsin, where he faces a daunting deficit in polls and a fractured Republican Party still smarting from his earlier insults to its favorite leaders.It is one of a handful of states where Mr. Trump has taken his campaign recently, despite signals he won't be competitive with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The GOP presidential nominee has trailed Mrs. Clinton by 15 percentage points in recent Wisconsin polling. Mrs. Clinton hasn't visited the state since its April primary and has yet to air a general-election television advertisement here.Mr. Trump barely addressed his Wisconsin challenges during a Tuesday speech here at the fairgrounds in Washington County, one of three suburban Milwaukee counties that comprise the state's Republican heartland. Almost 3 in 4 voters here backed Gov. Scott Walker in his 2014 re-election, and about 70% backed Mitt Romney in 2012.Yet Mr. Trump is weak here. A Marquette University Law School poll last week found Mr. Trump running just two points ahead of Mrs. Clinton in 10 suburban counties surrounding Milwaukee -- a region Mr. Romney won by 14 points in 2012 and Mr. Walker won by nearly 30 points in 2014.""You're seeing the true divide of rural Wisconsin versus urban Wisconsin,"" said Bill Johnson, a Trump supporter from rural Hayward who is the finance chairman for the state GOP. ""I don't think there's enough votes in the north and west to make up for what he's going to lose in the Milwaukee suburbs.""Mr. Trump's visit here comes amid a period of campaigning in states not thought to be the most competitive in November's general election. He held a rally Saturday in Connecticut and will travel later this week to Michigan. His running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, on Tuesday made a pair of stops in New Mexico.Those states aren't on Mrs. Clinton's radar. Neither the Clinton campaign nor a super PAC backing it, Priorities USA, are airing TV ads in Wisconsin, Michigan or New Mexico.The Republican National Committee, upon whom Mr. Trump is relying for his get-out-the-vote operation, has no staff in Connecticut or New Mexico.Trump aides told congressional allies on Tuesday that the campaign will within a week begin airing TV ads in traditional battleground states Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.Washington County brought Messrs. Romney and Walker their highest margins of victory of any Wisconsin county. It sits at the heart of a suburban region critical for statewide GOP candidates, who usually need to offset Democratic advantages in urban centers of Milwaukee and Madison.But Mr. Trump's attacks on Mr. Walker during the primary season -- when the governor backed Trump rival Sen. Ted Cruz -- left local Republicans unenthusiastic about backing the party's presidential nominee. That was compounded by Mr. Trump's initial refusal to endorse the re-election of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who hails from nearby Janesville.That has left Republicans here focusing on helping embattled GOP Sen. Ron Johnson in his re-election bid, at the expense of boosting Mr. Trump. Some GOP volunteers are treating the Senate race as if it is the top of the ticket.""We are doing doors for Ron Johnson,"" said Bob Gannon, a state assemblyman from West Bend. ""We want to get people to the polls, and our poll draw is the Johnson race.""Credit: By Reid J. Epstein",11/10/16

He also lashed out at media organizations for the way they covered the remarks.""Of course I'm being sarcastic,"" Mr. Trump said in Erie. ""And [the media] know that because after I said that, I said he's the [most valuable player], he's going to collect his MVP award,"" referring to a radio interview on his comments about the president. Later he added, ""But not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.""In his tweets, Mr. Trump continued a line of attack on Mrs. Clinton claiming the terrorist group gained power while she was secretary of state. ""ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!"" he said on Twitter.Mr. Trump's comments in Erie were a shift from statements he made Thursday, when he stood by his original claim at the Florida rally that the president and former secretary of state founded ISIS, the terrorist group also known as Islamic State.When asked on Thursday by radio talk-show host Hugh Hewitt if he meant to say that Mr. Obama indirectly created ISIS by pulling troops from Iraq, Mr. Trump said, ""No.""""I meant he's the founder of ISIS,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He was the most valuable player.""Jake Sullivan, the Clinton campaign's senior policy adviser, said in a statement Thursday that Mr. Trump's allegation was ""a false claim from a presidential candidate with an aversion to the truth and an unprecedented lack of knowledge.""The White House declined to comment.---Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.Credit: By Julian Routh",11/10/16
Pence Woos Trump Skeptics,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811729764?accountid=12768,"A week after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump threatened last month to put money into a super PAC to end the political careers of former rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich, Mr. Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, called each of them to try to make peace.While Mr. Trump has exacerbated intraparty tensions, Mr. Pence is trying to persuade GOP stalwarts to rally behind the party's presidential ticket.The task has taken him from the private office of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to a Phoenix airport meeting with embattled Arizona Sen. John McCain. He has tried to charm hostile talk-radio hosts, whose ranks he once belonged to, and even low-ranking state party officials.His pitch is subdued and often aimed at reminding his fellow Republicans about what unites them, including old friendships and alliances, according to people with whom he has spoken. The Trump-Pence partnership is also reversing the longstanding roles of nominee and running mate, as Mr. Trump leads the attack on Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and her vice-presidential pick, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine.""Mending fences isn't usually part of a vice-presidential nominee'sjob,"" said Mike Steel, who was an aide to House Speaker Paul Ryan when Mr. Ryan was Republican Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012. ""But we've never before seen a nominee like Donald Trump, who has alienated huge swaths of the party.""Mr. Trump hasn't given Mr. Pence an explicit mandate to conduct the peacemaking expeditions, Pence aides said, but the low-key Indiana governor has kept the New Yorker abreast of his discussions.The meetings and phone calls illuminate the difference between Mr. Pence's experience as a career politician and Mr. Trump's life in real estate, where victory comes with the defeat of a rival.Mr. Pence's quiet diplomacy can serve dual purposes: quelling intraparty divisions and preserving relationships he may need in the future if the 2016 election doesn't turn out as he hopes.""Mike has longstanding relationships with many of these people, and part of his role is to unify the party,"" Pence spokesman Marc Short said. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.Mr. Pence's record so far has been mixed. Iowa Rep. Steve King, who was one of Mr. Cruz's staunchest supporters, threw his support behind Mr. Trump last week after Mr. Pence met with him in Iowa.Yet Mr. Pence's toughest challenges have been Mr. Trump's former presidential rivals, who are still smarting from months of insults from the nominee.Mr. Pence and Texas Sen. Mr. Cruz spoke by phone late last week, according to people familiar with the call. Mr. Pence called Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, but got his voice mail. Mr. Kasich returned the call and left a message. The two haven't connected since, according to aides to both men.Perhaps no presidential candidate was damaged more by Mr. Trump than Mr. Bush, on whom Mr. Trump stuck the label ""low energy"" last summer. The former governor, along with his father and brother, both former Republican presidents, have refused to endorse Mr. Trump.But Mr. Bush took a meeting with Mr. Pence on July 27 in Coral Gables, Fla., at the Biltmore Hotel, where the former Florida governor keeps his personal office. Aides to Messrs. Pence, Bush, Cruz and Kasich declined to comment on the specifics of their conversations.Mr. Pence's approach to Trump skeptics is a soft sell.To Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin conservative talk-radio host who has made a cottage industry out of his opposition to Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence stressed his own background in radio when they spent a half-hour together last month at the Milwaukee airport.""It was not like a hard pitch,"" Mr. Sykes said. ""There were no apologies for Mr. Trump. It was, 'Hey look, I'm one of you, a conservative. I'm a Paul Ryan guy.'""A week later, Mr. Trump toyed with the notion of refusing to endorse Mr. Ryan, the House speaker, in his Wisconsin primary. The next day, Mr. Pence endorsed his friend and onetime House colleague.Mr. Trump ultimately came around to backing the speaker, who easily won his primary. But the speaker and the nominee haven't spoken since then. Meanwhile, Mr. Pence and Mr. Ryan have had several conversations, aides said.During a recent campaign swing through Arizona, Mr. Pence went to dinner with GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, who has refused to endorse Mr. Trump.""He talked about the ticket. I certainly respect him,"" Mr. Flake saidSundayduring an interview on CBS. Mr. Pence's pitch, Mr. Flake said, was that ""Donald Trump is a different guy in private than he has shown in public. He made a good case."" Mr. Flake still hasn't backed Mr. Trump.Along with political foes, Mr. Pence and his team are in communication with officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is mired in a political skirmish with Mr. Trump over trade policy.Mr. Pence's aides check in with the Chamber's senior political strategist, Scott Reed, ""for analysis on what is really going on,"" Mr. Reed said.Mr. Pence's attempts at political reconciliation have only gone so far. He hasn't reached out to Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, the loudest and most consistent Trump critic in Congress, a Sasse aide said. He also hasn't called New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican in a tough re-election race whom Mr. Trump also endorsed belatedly.Mr. Short said Mr. Pence is reaching out to Trump-wary Republicans as his schedule and travels permit -- and when problems suddenly emerge.When first-term Ohio state legislatorNiraj Antanithis past week was refused entry to a campaign event near Dayton because he had posted tweets favorable to Mr. Kasich, Mr. Pence called him after the event.Mr. Antani said Mr. Pence apologized and praised Mr. Kasich, saying that as neighboring governors they became friendly. ""He said Kasich is a good friend of his and that he wants to unify the party,"" Mr. Antani said. ""I'm going to probably vote for him now.""Credit: By Reid J. Epstein",11/10/16
"Election 2016: Clinton and Kaine Release Taxes --- Democrat, trying to press rival Trump, reveals income decline in campaign run-up",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811729748?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton's 2015 tax return showed a sharp drop in income as she launched her presidential campaign, along with a higher federal effective income-tax rate than any president since Gerald Ford, a sign of caution for a candidate facing intense scrutiny over her family's finances.The return showed Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton made $10.6 million in adjusted gross income last year, largely from speaking fees, books, and Mr. Clinton's consulting activities.The Clinton campaign used Friday's disclosures to pressure Donald Trump for refusing to release his tax returns. He has said he won't do so until an audit has been completed, which could make him the first major-party presidential candidate since 1976 to release no returns.The Clintons paid an effective federal income-tax rate of 34% in 2015. Their income was down from $28 million in 2014, when they paid an effective tax rate of more than 35%. According to Internal Revenue Service data for 2013 returns, the most recent available, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $10 million and above paid an average of 26% in total federal income tax.The latest return showed the Clintons gave more than $1 million, or nearly 10% of their gross income, to charity.Almost all of those donations went to the Clinton Family Foundation, a fund established in 2001 that serves as the vehicle for the couple's charitable giving and is different from the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit whose activities have been scrutinized. The family foundation made donations worth $3.8 million in 2014, $1.8 million in 2013 and $1 million in 2012.Around half of the giving in 2014 went to the Clinton Foundation, with the rest split between 63 groups that included universities, medical centers, museums and other nonprofits. The Clinton Foundation received around one-quarter of gifts from the smaller family foundation in 2012 and 2013.Joseph Thorndike, a tax historian at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publisher, said Mrs. Clinton in the latest year had a higher tax rate than any sitting president since Mr. Ford, whose average rate was nearly 38% during his presidency. The lowest average rate belonged to George H.W. Bush, who paid just under 20%.""It's striking that for a rich person, her tax return is very boring,"" said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that specializes in tax issues, who was a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration. ""She certainly could afford to pay people to help her figure out ways to avoid paying more in taxes.""Mrs. Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.), released 10 years of his returns. Mr. Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, paid an effective rate of 20% last year on $313,000 in adjusted gross income.Their rate ranged from as low as 13% in 2009, when they had nearly $180,000 in adjusted gross income during Mr. Kaine's last full year as governor of Virginia, to 24% in 2011, when they reported $256,000 in adjusted gross income.They donated 6.8% of their adjusted gross income to charity last year and 7.5% over the past 10 years. According to IRS data for 2013 tax returns, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of between $200,000 and $500,000 paid an average of nearly 20% in total federal income tax. Mrs. Clinton had previously posted online her returns back to 2007. She and her husband have released returns dating to 1977.In a statement, the Trump campaign called the release of Mrs. Clinton's taxes a ""distraction and misdirection"" from other controversies that have dogged the former secretary of state, including her use of a private email server while she was in government as well as her office's contacts with the Clinton Foundation.Mr. Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, also hasn't released his tax returns.---Laura Meckler and Richard Rubin contributed to this article.Credit: By Nick Timiraos and Laura Saunders",11/10/16
Trump and Clinton Will Go Down in History -- For a While,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1811049747?accountid=12768,"Somewhere in America, just after 2 o'clock on a steamy summer afternoon, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were out making their rounds, seeking to become a permanent part of the nation's history. On East William Street in Delaware, Ohio, I was the only person in front of the BP gas station, looking toward a small patch of dirt and sparse foliage.Near the gas pumps, a Bud Light delivery truck had just parked. Its driver, on foot, noisily wheeled some silver-colored kegs of beer past where I stood. Traffic on William Street was fairly heavy, but as far as I could tell not a single motorist glanced over toward the object that had caught my eye.""Very few people even realize it's here,"" the owner of the gas station, Jean Khanjian, told me. ""I don't think it has any effect on our business, either way.""What I was looking at was a weathered plaque declaring that the spot where the pumps stand ($2.05 a gallon on this Midwestern day) was the birthplace of Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States. It has been almost a hundred years since the house where his mother gave birth to him -- his father had died during her pregnancy -- was torn down.All the frenzied striving by a different crop of candidates every four years for the enduring eminence that comes with the presidency, all the time and hope put into overcoming the odds that will keep all but one from making it to the White House -- all of it, as we're seeing this summer, is so perpetually present-tense and seemingly urgent. And yet . . .The Upper Cut barber shop was next door, a pizza place called Amato's diagonally across the street. There was a black rubber hose snaked around the base of the plaque, which has been here since 1926 through a succession of different gas-station proprietors. No water emerged from the mouth of the hose, and some of the dirt had cracked in the heat.Only 400 or so people lived in Delaware in 1822, when the baby was born to his just-widowed mother. Hayes is not a president about whom many people give much thought these days. He served a single term, from 1877 to 1881, preceded by Ulysses S. Grant and succeeded by James A. Garfield. But still, when a president comes from a small town, you might think his birthplace would be commemorated in grander fashion.""Indeed,"" the head of the Delaware County Historical Society, Brent Carson, told me when I sought him out. ""It's not really befitting of a president of the United States. There's not even a place on the street for a car to park so a driver can get out."" Is there any presidential birthplace in the U.S. marked as modestly as this one at the gas station? ""I can't imagine,"" Mr. Carson said.The cable newscasts on this afternoon were wall-to-wall with reports about Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton and their parallel quests to become the 45th president. One day the place where one of them was born will become a draw for sightseers, part of the immortality that automatically accompanies victory.""We're proud that a president was born here,"" said R. Thomas Homan, the city manager of Delaware. ""But is that gas station a destination for tourists? I would have to say no.""Not that the town is indifferent. Last year a committee was set up to devise a more proper tribute to President Hayes. The chairman of the committee was an 18-year-old senior at Rutherford B. Hayes High School, Cory Beam, who told me that he gave up playing varsity baseball this spring -- he was a starting pitcher -- to work on the project.""The plaque's not even legible anymore,"" he said. ""You can hardly read it. People walk by like it's not even there. That's not the way a president from your town should be remembered.""Mr. Beam -- he's leaving Delaware to go to college this fall -- and his committee recently presented a plan to the city's leaders. If funding can be found, a statue of Rutherford B. Hayes would be erected in a plaza that would be designed nearby, with a fountain and a place for visitors to sit. Although the plaza would not be on the precise site where Hayes was born, the statue's eyes would be looking directly at the BP station where the house once stood.On this afternoon a woman gassed up her gray Toyota Camry. With a dog in her back seat she turned left onto William Street. She accelerated first past the plaque and then past St. Mark's Lutheran Church, and there is, in the end, an unexpected sort of grandeur to this place. It is the indisputable affirmation of an American truth. The old promise is real:From a spot like this one, all the way to the White House. You can get there from here.---Mr. Greene's books include ""Chevrolet Summers, Dairy Queen Nights"" (Harper Perennial, 2001).Credit: By Bob Greene",11/10/16
"Michaels's Take: Under Trump, SEC Could Shake Up Stock Trading; Paul Atkins, a former Republican member of the SEC, could now return to the agency as its chairman",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1838169755?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump probably has bigger things on his mind than the structure of the stock market. But looking at who's on his transition team, an overhaul of the $26 trillion U.S. equity market could become a top priority.As reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday , the group advising Mr. Trump includes Paul Atkins, who was a Republican member of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 2002 to 2008 and could now return to the agency as its chairman. During Mr. Atkins's time, the SEC approved a monumental set of rules meant to promote competition among stock exchanges and reduce costs for investors.That's not how Mr. Atkins saw the rules, however. He and Cynthia Glassman, a GOP colleague, issued a blistering dissent in 2005 when the SEC approved Regulation National Market System, or Reg NMS, on a 3-2 vote.In their dissent, Mr. Atkins and Ms. Glassman took aim at one important prong of Reg NMS: the ""trade through"" rule, which prevents stockbrokers from executing orders at a price that is worse than the best quote shown in the market. In effect, the rule made price the most important factor in filling orders, leaving brokers with less freedom to consider factors such as an exchange's order-fill rates, technology or costs. Critics of Reg NMS say it also juiced the transition to superfast markets because traders needed to be first to an exchange to match against the best-priced offer.""Instead of facilitating a national market system in which technology, competition and innovation will produce benefits for all investors, Regulation NMS saddles the marketplace with anachronistic regulation that reduces investor choice and raises investor costs,"" Mr. Atkins and Ms. Glassman wrote in their dissent.There is little reason to think Mr. Atkins's view has changed much. In an opinion article published in the Journal in January , Mr. Atkins called the rule a mistake and wrote that it ""has driven order flow away from exchanges and toward dark pools, fueled unhealthy trading volatility, and exposed the markets to flash crashes.""Big changes to Reg NMS would be controversial and could create winners and losers. But the SEC has at least shown interest in revisiting its decision. In September, the agency sought public comment on changing the rule. And Mr. Atkins, were he named chairman, could draw on work done this year for a blue-ribbon advisory committee that has recommended changes to market structure for current SEC Chairman Mary Jo White.""It's probably very likely that Reg NMS and more broadly the whole question of how the market structure works is likely to be a focus for the first term of a new chairman,"" said Richard Ketchum, a former chief executive of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, an industry-funded monitor of the brokerage industry that reports to the SEC.To be sure, if the next SEC chairman isn't Mr. Atkins but someone who lacks a background in market structure, the person probably wouldn't gravitate toward something as complex as Reg NMS. In recent years, Republicans have pushed other priorities for the SEC that are easier for most voters to understand, including loosening rules on how small businesses raise money.But Mr. Atkins's most recent public thoughts on the matter--spelled out in his Journal op-ed--make it clear that he, personally, would like a second crack at the rules: ""The SEC should take a hard look at Reg NMS and re-examine its effects,"" he wrote in January.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.comCredit: By Dave Michaels",11/11/16
"Trump Trade Worries Send Investors Fleeing Asian Currencies; Ringgit, rupiah hit as investors fear the effects of U.S. trade protectionism",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837893558?accountid=12768,"Asian currencies sold off as investors feared the effects of U.S. trade protectionism and more aggressive inflation-fighting measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve, sending investors fleeing for the higher returns and perceived safety of U.S. stocks and credit.The U.S. dollar rose sharply Friday against the Indonesian rupiah, the Malaysian ringgit and the South Korean won, while the offshore Chinese yuan was also volatile.The U.S. dollar rose as much as 2.7% against the Indonesian rupiah, its biggest move in six months, prompting intervention by Bank Indonesia.Bank Indonesia's senior deputy governor Mirza Adityaswara told The Wall Street Journal that the central bank was in the market, but declined to provide further details.Markets were assessing the impact of potentially higher levels of fiscal stimulus under the administration of president-elect Donald Trump. He has pledged to aggressively spend and cut taxes, paths that economists perceive to be acutely inflationary. That could prompt a tougher stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve in response.Rising U.S. rates typically spell trouble for emerging markets as traders pull out of risky assets, said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.""What we're seeing is potentially the beginning of an unwinding of the carry trades that have been very popular over the course of this year, which have amounted to huge capital flows into the region,"" said Mr. Goh. ""The market is going through a repricing of emerging markets.""This changing investment environment is best seen in the rise in yields for U.S. Treasurys, which acts as floor for yields on many U.S. assets. This has pulled money out of emerging markets to chase potentially higher-yielding assets in the U.S. Mr. Goh added.""Both near term and also over the longer term, investors may want to position for higher inflation,"" Scott Mather, chief investment officer for U.S. core strategies at Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, wrote in a research note. ""We expect increased pressure on the U.S. dollar to appreciate, strengthening in particular versus emerging market currencies.""Many long-only fund managers were sitting on the sidelines and avoiding overreacting, but those that were active were buying aggressively, said Lee Porter, managing director for Asia-Pacific at Liquidnet, an institutional brokerage.""Typically, whenever there's volatility, emerging markets get smashed,"" he said. ""Money gets ripped out of riskier markets and goes into safe havens, then very often finds its way back very quickly.""The prospect of protectionist trade policies from the U.S., if not trade wars, has also weighed on the outlook for export-orientated economies in Asia-Pacific.The South Korean won fluctuated between gains and losses after the Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee unanimously voted to keep rates unchanged at 1.25% for a fifth straight month.Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric would be negative for global trade and Korean exports, but it's uncertain whether that will translate into policy, said Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol at a news conference after the central bank's decision.The Chinese yuan also weakened in onshore markets, edging closer to the levels at which it was briefly pegged against the U.S. dollar around 6.83 during the global financial crisis.The People's Bank of China set its daily reference rate for the yuan at 6.8115 against the U.S. dollar, a move 0.3% weaker compared with Thursday's rate and a fresh six-year low for the currency. Onshore, where the yuan is allowed to move within 2% of the so-called fix, the yuan weakened 0.2% at 6.8112 against the greenback, the weakest levels in eight years.In the offshore market, where the yuan trades freely around the clock, the currency fell to record lows of 6.8491 against the U.S. dollar during American trading hours overnight. It was last flat at 6.8263.The Malaysian ringgit briefly hit the weakest levels seen this year, before trading 1.2% weaker at 4.4075 against the U.S. dollar.I-Made Sentana and Kwanwoo Jun contributed to this story.Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.comCredit: By Gregor Stuart Hunter",11/11/16
"How to Get Beyond Our Tribal Politics; Whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins Tuesday, understanding the psychological causes of our national rift can help us bridge it",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837629507?accountid=12768,"Corrections & Amplifications:Among Democrats and Republicans, the percentage in each party who sees the policies of the other as being ""so misguided that they threaten the nation's well-being"" has grown by 10 percentage points since 2014, according to Pew Research. An earlier version of this article incorrectly incorrectly gave the rise as 10%. (Nov. 10, 2016)The most-watched made-for-TV movie in American history is ""The Day After,"" a 1983 portrayal of life in Kansas and Missouri in the days just before and after an all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union. If you've had even fleeting thoughts that Tuesday's election could bring about the end of the world or the destruction of the country, you might want to find ""The Day After"" on YouTube, scroll to minute 53 and watch the next six minutes. Now that's an apocalypse.It's an absurd comparison, of course, but the absurdity is helpful. It reminds us that no matter how bad things seem, we have a lot to be grateful for. The Soviet Union is gone, and life in America has gotten much better since the 1980s by most objective measures. Crime is way down, prosperity and longevity are way up, and doors are open much more widely for talented people from just about any demographic group. Yes, we have new problems, and the benefits haven't been spread evenly, but if you look at the big picture, we are making astonishing progress.Watching ""The Day After"" also might help Americans to tone down the apocalyptic language that so many have used about the presidential race. On the right, some speak of this as the ""Flight 93 election,"" meaning that America has been hijacked by treasonous leftists who are trying to crash the plane, so electing Donald Trump to rush the cockpit is the only sane choice. On the left, some think that a Trump victory would lead to a constitutional crisis followed by a military coup, fascism and dictatorship.Nearly half the country will therefore wake up deeply disappointed on the morning of Nov. 9, and many members of the losing side will think that America is doomed. Those on the winning side will feel relieved, but many will be shocked and disgusted that nearly half of their fellow citizens voted for the moral equivalent of the devil. The disgust expressed by both sides in this election is particularly worrisome because disgust dehumanizes its targets. That is why it is usually fostered by the perpetrators of genocide--disgust makes it easier for ordinary citizens to kill their neighbors.In short, the day after this election is likely to be darker and more foreboding than the day after just about any U.S. election since 1860. Is it possible for Americans to forgive, accept and carry on working and living together?We think that it is. After all, civility doesn't require consensus or the suspension of criticism. It is simply the ability to disagree productively with others while respecting their sincerity and decency. That can be hard to do when emotions run so high. But if we understand better the psychological causes of our current animosity, we can all take some simple steps to turn it down, free ourselves from hatred and make the next four years better for ourselves and the country. Three time-honored quotations can serve as guides.""Me against my brother, my brothers and me against my cousins, then my cousins and me against strangers."" --Bedouin sayingHuman nature is tribal. We form teams easily, most likely because we have evolved for violent intergroup conflict. Our minds take to it so readily that we invent myths, games and sports--including war games like paintball--that let us enjoy the pleasures of intergroup conflict without the horrors of actual war.The tribal mind is adept at changing alliances to face shifting threats, as the Bedouin saying indicates. We see such shifts after party primaries, when those who backed a losing candidate swing around to support the nominee. And we saw it happen after the 9/11 attacks, when the country came together to support the president and the military in the invasion of Afghanistan.But with the exception of the few months after 9/11, cross-partisan animosity has been rising steadily since the late 1990s. This year, for the first time since Pew Research began asking in 1994, majorities in both parties expressed not just ""unfavorable"" views of the other party but ""very unfavorable"" views . Those ratings were generally below 20% throughout the 1990s. And more than 40% in each party now see the policies of the other party as being ""so misguided that they threaten the nation's well-being."" Those numbers are up by about 10 percentage points in both parties just since 2014.So what will happen the next time there is a major terrorist attack? Will we come together again? Or will the attack become a partisan football within hours, as happened after the various lone-wolf attacks of the past year? Something is broken in American tribalism. It is now ""my brothers and me against my cousins"" all the time, even when we are threatened by strangers and even when there is no threat at all.Democracy requires trust and cooperation as well as competition. A healthy democracy features flexible and shifting coalitions. We must find a way to see citizens on the other side as cousins who are sometimes opponents but who share most of our values and interests and are never our mortal enemies.""Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?... You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye."" --Jesus, in Matthew 7:3-5Our tribal minds are equipped with a powerful tool: shameless and clueless hypocrisy. It is a general rule of psychology that ""thinking is for doing"": We think with a particular purpose in mind, and often that purpose isn't to find the truth but to defend ourselves or attack our opponents.Psychologists call this process ""motivated reasoning."" It is found whenever self-interest is in play. When the interests of a group are added to the mix, this sort of biased, god-awful reasoning becomes positively virtuous--it signals your loyalty to the team. This is why partisans find it so easy to dismiss scandalous revelations about their own candidate while focusing so intently on scandalous revelations about the other candidate.Motivated reasoning has interacted with tribalism and new media technologies since the 1990s in unfortunate ways. Social media, hackers and Google searches now help us to find hundreds of specks in our opponents' eyes, but no technology can force us to acknowledge the logs in our own.""Nature has so formed us that a certain tie unites us all, but...this tie becomes stronger from proximity."" --Cicero, ""On Friendship""Humans are tribal, but tribalism can be transcended. It exists in tension with our extraordinary ability to develop bonds with other human beings. Romeo and Juliet fell in love. French, British and German soldiers came out of their trenches in World War I to exchange food, cigarettes and Christmas greetings.The key, as Cicero observed, is proximity, and a great deal of modern research backs him up. Students are more likely to become friends with the student whose dorm room is one door away than with the student whose room is four doors away. People who have at least one friend from the other political party are less likely to hate the supporters of that party.But tragically, Americans are losing their proximity to those on the other side and are spending more time in politically purified settings. Since the 1980s, Democrats have been packing into the cities while the rural areas and exurbs have been getting more Republican. Institutions that used to bring people together--such as churches--are now splitting apart over culture war issues such as gay marriage.Ever more of our social life is spent online, in virtual communities or networks that are politically homogeneous. When we do rub up against the other side online, relative anonymity often leads to stunning levels of incivility, including racist and sexist slurs and threats of violence.So are we doomed? Will the polarizing trends identified by Pew just keep going until the country splits in two? Maybe John Adams was right in 1814 when he wrote, ""Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.""But we have lasted 240 years so far, and both sides agree that America is worth fighting for. We just have to see that the fight isn't always against each other; it is also a struggle to adapt our democracy and our habits for polarizing times and technologies.Some of these adaptations will require changes to laws and institutions. Some will come from improving technology as we fine-tune social media to reward productive disagreement while filtering out trolling and intimidation.And many of the changes must come from each of us, as individuals who have friends, co-workers and cousins who voted for the other side. How will we treat them as customers, employees, students and neighbors? What will we say to them at Thanksgiving dinner?If you would like to let go of anger on Nov. 9 without letting go of your moral and political principles, here is some advice, adapted from ancient wisdom and modern research.First, separate your feelings about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from your feelings about their supporters. Political scientists report that since the 1980s, Americans have increasingly voted against the other side's candidate, rather than voting enthusiastically for their own, and that is especially true this time. So don't assume that most people on the other side like or even agree with their candidate on any particular issue. They may be voting out of fears and frustrations that you don't understand, but if you knew their stories, you might well empathize with them.Second, step back and think about your goals. In the long run, would you rather change people or hate them? If you actually want to persuade or otherwise influence people, you should know that it is nearly impossible to change people's minds by arguing with them. When there is mutual antipathy, there is mutual motivated reasoning, defensiveness and hypocrisy.But anything that opens the heart opens the mind as well, so do what you can to cultivate personal relationships with those on the other side. Spend time together, and let the proximity recommended by Cicero strengthen ties. Familiarity does not breed contempt. Research shows that as things or people become familiar, we like them more.Emotions often drive reasoning, so as our hearts harden, our thinking also calcifies, and we become dogmatic. We are less able to think flexibly and address the social problems that we claim to care about. As John Stuart Mill wrote in 1859, ""He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that."" So cultivating a few cross-partisan friendships will make you smarter as well as calmer, even if polarization grows worse.And if you do find a way to have a real conversation with someone on the other side, approach it skillfully. One powerful opener is to point to a log in your own eye--to admit right up front that you or your side were wrong about something. Doing this at the start of a conversation signals that you aren't in combat mode. If you are open, trusting and generous, your partner is likely to reciprocate.Another powerful depolarizing move is praise, as we saw in the second Clinton-Trump debate. After more than 90 minutes of antagonism, a member of the town-hall audience brought the evening to a close with this question: ""Would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?""Mrs. Clinton began with weak praise by saying that she respects Mr. Trump's children. But then she made it strong and generous by noting how ""incredibly able"" those children are and how devoted they are to their father, adding, ""I think that says a lot about Donald."" Mr. Trump responded in kind: ""I will say this about Hillary. She doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up. I respect that.""That brief exchange was emotionally powerful--the only uplifting moment of the night for many viewers. Had it been the opening exchange, might the debate have been more elevated, more constructive?This has been a frightening year for many Americans. Questions about the durability, legitimacy and wisdom of our democracy have been raised, both here and abroad. But the true test of our democracy--and our love of country--will come on the day after the election. Starting next Wednesday, each of us must decide what kind of person we want to be and what kind of relationship we want to have with our politically estranged cousins.Dr. Haidt is a social psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business, a fellow at the Martin Prosperity Institute and the author of ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion.""

Copper Prices Settle at More Than One-Year High on Trump's Infrastructure Talk; Copper for December delivery settled up 3.7% at $2.5510 a pound on Comex,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837554195?accountid=12768,"Industrial metals climbed and copper prices shot to more than one-year highs on Thursday, as investors put their trust in President-elect Donald Trump to spend on U.S. infrastructure.Copper for December delivery settled up 3.7% at $2.5510 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close since July 2015. This built on a more than 3% gain Wednesday following the news that the Republican nominee had been elected president.""Rather than being paralyzed with shock or engaging in panicked selling, participants on the metals markets appear to be responding not only calmly but even with downright euphoria to the news of Donald Trump's election as the new U.S. president,"" Commerzbank AG said.Mr. Trump has said he would cut taxes and invest more than $500 billion in infrastructure, which could lift demand for metals used for building and manufacturing.""If [investors] are taking this at face value, that's going to be good for metals prices,"" said William Adams, head of research at FastMarkets in London.Large projects could significantly boost base metals, which have risen swiftly this year after struggling with overcapacity, stockpiles and weakening demand from China, the world's top consumer.Copper's surge builds on a multiweek rally, which has lifted prices on expectations of resurgent Chinese manufacturing growth and falling stockpiles of the metal in Shanghai and London. However, the extended gains have raised questions on the sustainability of copper's recent move higher.""This is just extra fuel at the late end of the rally,"" said Mr. Adams. ""It's all gone a bit hot, I think. Too hot.""Analysts were also skeptical that the Trump-related gains could be sustained, noting that his protectionist policies could hurt trade with China. Natixis's Bernard Dahdah said the picture would be unclear until January when Mr. Trump is inaugurated.""The things he says, does he mean them or not?"" the metals analyst asked.Thursday's gains weren't limited to copper.""Sentiment is even more bullish in China's iron ore and steel markets, despite the threat of increasing protectionism in the U.S.,"" said Carsten Menke, a commodities research analyst at Julius Baer.Chinese-traded iron ore prices are up almost 17% this week, while steel prices have risen 10%, Mr. Menke said.The London Metal Exchange's three-month copper contract closed up 3.4% at $5,601.00 a metric ton. Aluminum closed up 1% at $1,770.00 a ton, zinc closed up 1.4% at $2,525.00 a ton, tin rose 1.1% to $21,505.00 a ton and lead rose 0.6% to $2,154.00 a ton.

Green Elites Face Trump Threat; A chance to clean up rampant cronyism in the energy sector won't soon return.,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837113360?accountid=12768,"Whatever you think of Donald Trump, his candidacy represents an important opportunity. It's a chance to dismiss a very particular elite about whom it could be said, borrowing from Cromwell, ""For any good you have been doing . . . in the name of God, go!""We are referring, of course, to America's green-energy elite.With a Hillary Clinton victory on Tuesday, America's ludicrous Tesla subsidies would be certain to continue--because so many Democratic politicians aligned with the company, especially in California, are themselves too big to fail.Washington's Kafkaesque fuel mileage rules would only become more Kafkaesque. By forcing car makers and their customers to invest in economically unjustified fuel-saving technology, they've already perversely contributed to last summer's breaking of a decade-old record for miles traveled and fuel burned.Ethanol's alleged greenhouse benefits have long since been scientifically debunked. Its putative contribution to America's ""energy security"" has been rendered a joke by the fracking revolution. Never mind. Corn farmers like a handout, and corn-state senators like being re-elected. The cost to American motorists: $10 billion a year.And making sure it remains so--we hardly needed the latest WikiLeaks dump to tell us--have been a handful of activist hedge-fund billionaires like Tom Steyer and Nat Simons. In the recent dump of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, we see these men, in return for being willing to write four-figure checks to Democratic candidates, fishing for reassurance that policies that cost the American people billions, with no benefits, will be embraced by the next Democratic administration.We see climate saints like Bill McKibben and Joe Romm conspiring at their behest to silence a scientist for saying perfectly accurate things about the lack of evidence for a worsening of extreme weather events. We see Mr. Podesta himself trying to orchestrate a media mugging of liberal Harvard Law Prof. Larry Tribe for representing the coal industry.And to what end, exactly?Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, is hardly a green-energy naysayer. Yet last week he estimated that even if electric vehicles accounted for half of global auto sales (currently EVs account for less than 1%), oil consumption would nevertheless continue to rise because the ""demand growth is not coming from cars, it's from trucks, aviation and the petrochemical industry and we don't have major alternatives to oil products there.""Mr. Birol politely failed to mention that the climate effect would also be nil, because these electric cars would be running on coal. China, the world's biggest consumer of electric vehicles, fires up a new coal plant at the rate of one or two per week and will do so for years to come.President Obama's ""clean power plan,"" costing upward of $200 billion over the next 15 years, will have no discernible effect on temperatures even a century hence. A catastrophic idiocy has informed Europe's favoritism toward diesel cars: In return for trivial CO2 gains, it got dirtier air in its cities. The Nature Conservancy, in a 2009 study, finds that even a modest U.S. cap-and-trade program of the sort preached by greenies would require ""an area larger than the state of Nebraska"" for biofuels, wind and solar.And still the effect would be meaningless: A 100% cut in U.S. emissions, by the standard climate sensitivity estimate, would influence temperatures by less than 0.2 degrees centigrade a century from now.Even a carbon tax--the sensible policy--would offer no help unless the technological possibility already exists of meeting human needs with alternative energy at a price competitive with fossil fuels. In which case such technology will be forthcoming anyway for market reasons.All this might be terrifically worrisome if climate change fears were soundly established by science. They aren't. Al Gore-like forecasts of doom rely on doubtful computer simulations. As the International Panel on Climate Change delicately phrases it, numerous possible paths for future temperature are in rough ""agreement with observations."" This is a roundabout way of saying that the observations have been unable to discern the effect, if any, of human-scale emissions on global temperature.But then policies in a democracy are not sustained by their rationale. They are sustained by vested interests. Mr. Trump may be rude, crude, and largely visionless to boot. Yet purely by virtue of being out of sympathy with such elites his election would go a long way to de-corrupting America at least as far as energy policy is concerned.We could still hope for action from Hillary Clinton on tax reform and other worthwhile pieces of the American agenda, but we will have missed an opportunity in this election to rein in perhaps the most dishonest, self-serving interest group of any in the American pageant.Credit: By Holman W.

America's Dazzling Tech Boom Has a Downside: Not Enough Jobs; The discontent driving Donald Trump's campaign stems partly from the dashed employment promises of the late 1990s; $7-an-hour robots,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1827933085?accountid=12768,"The technology revolution has delivered Google searches, Facebook friends, iPhone apps, Twitter rants and shopping for almost anything on Amazon, all in the past decade and a half.What it hasn't delivered are many jobs. Google's Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. had at the end of last year a total of 74,505 employees, about one-third fewer than Microsoft Corp. even though their combined stock-market value is twice as big. Photo-sharing service Instagram had 13 employees when it was acquired for $1 billion by Facebook in 2012.Hiring in the computer and chip sectors dove after companies shifted hardware production outside the U.S., and the newest tech giants needed relatively few workers. The number of technology startups fizzled. Growth in productivity and wages slowed, and income inequality rose as machines replaced routine, low- and middle-income, human-powered work.This outcome is a far cry from what many political leaders, tech entrepreneurs and economists predicted about a generation ago. In 2000, President Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address : ""America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology."" His economic team trumpeted ""the ferment of rapid technological change "" as one of the U.S. economy's ""principal engines"" of growth.The gap between what the tech boom promised and then delivered is another source of the rumbling national discontent that powered the rise this year of political outsiders Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.The tech-powered disappointment is subtler than the anger caused by the crushing impact of China's import invasion and the perceived failures of government institutions like the Federal Reserve in guiding the economy . Instead, it stems from the idea that Americans expected larger economic gains from these amazing new machines and the companies that created them, not a widening between the haves and have-nots.""There is a growing sense of frustration that people haven't seen the progress that their parents and grandparents did,"" says Erik Brynjolfsson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose work has chronicled how technology widens the income gap between rich and poor. ""That frustration spills into the political arena.""In 1997, Time magazine named computer-chip maker Intel Corp.'s chief executive, Andrew S. Grove, who died in March 2016, as ""Man of the Year."" Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos won in 1999. Companies spent billions of dollars reprogramming their computers for the Year 2000 bug , and profitless dot-com startups won giant valuations from optimistic investors.The bursting of the dot-com bubble in early 2000, the recession in 2001 and deepening globalization proved to be turning points for the tech economy and its broader impact on American prosperity.U.S. tech companies accelerated the reshuffling of their supply networks to China and elsewhere in Asia, places filled with growth potential and cheap labor. Hardware makers concentrated production overseas to supply U.S. and foreign computer makers.After rising through the 1990s, total employment at computer and electronic firms in the U.S. sank to 1.03 million in August 2016 from 1.87 million in 2001, according to Labor Department statistics. Employment at semiconductor makers fell by half to 359,000 in the same period.In the 1990s, Micron Technology Inc. was a successful example of how far the tech industry reached beyond its nexus in Silicon Valley. Based in Boise, Idaho, Micron was founded by Idaho farmers and businessmen, including the late billionaire J.R. Simplot, who supplied McDonald's Corp. with most of its frozen french fries and had ""MR SPUD"" license plates on his pickup truck.Micron's workforce quadrupled to 18,800 between 1994 and 2000, with the growth overwhelmingly in the U.S. The company fought with Japan in the 1980s to restrict imported memory chips and protect its U.S. base.These days, Micron is a case study in how technology companies have exported jobs to other countries. As of 2013, the most recently disclosed data, Micron had 11,300 workers in the U.S., down from 14,000 in 2000. The company's non-U.S. workforce surged to 19,600, mainly in China and other Asian nations, from 4,800.Securities filings show that the percentage of employees at Micron who were in the U.S. shrank to 37% from 74% in the same period. The company stopped disclosing the annual percentage in 2014. A Micron spokesman says much of the growth outside the U.S. came from acquisitions.""What we're doing is replacing more resources there to support the growing customer base--both the multinationals that are leveraging the low labor-cost areas in China, in particular, as well as the indigenous Chinese manufacturers,"" Mike Sadler, Micron's head of sales, told analysts in 2004. He is now Micron's strategic chief.The Semiconductor Industry Association says semiconductors remain a big U.S. business and are America's third-largest export, trailing cars and aircraft.Apple Inc. followed a similar path. Co-founder Steve Jobs made it a mission early in his Apple career and after creating NeXT Inc., another computer maker, to revitalize U.S. manufacturing. Macintosh computers rolled off the line at an Apple factory ""like a Holiday Inn toaster turns out toasted bagels,"" says Brent Schlender, who co-wrote a biography of Mr. Jobs.By the time Mr. Jobs died in 2011 , Apple made nearly every one of its products outside America, largely in Asia. Apple halted U.S. manufacturing in 2004 and didn't resume until 2013, when it began producing Mac Pro personal computers in Austin, Texas .Apple says it employs about 80,000 workers in the U.S., or two-thirds of the company's overall workforce. About half the U.S. employees have retail jobs.An Apple spokeswoman says it is ""creating jobs in new industries like the App Economy,"" or apps developed for the iPhone, and is ""a major contributor to U.S. manufacturing"" by buying American-made components and materials.Mr. Schlender, the Jobs biographer, says it made sense to assemble the iPod outside the U.S. when production began in 2001. ""The components were hard to make, and putting them together was a labor-intensive job because everything was so small,"" he says. ""You had to piece it together by hand.""The computer-hardware exodus spread. International Business Machines Corp., the company that turned computers into a big business, was born in Endicott, N.Y. , and built its first factories there.From 2001 to 2015, though, employment in computer and electronics manufacturing in surrounding Broome County fell about two-thirds to 3,055 jobs. Warehouses and transportation companies scooped up some laid-off workers at salaries of less than half those paid in high-tech manufacturing, says Christian Harris, an analyst for the New York State Department of Labor.American tech workers are getting a smaller piece of the economic pie created from what they produce. As of 2014, employee compensation in computer and electronic-parts making was equal to 49% of the value of the industry's output, down from 79% in 1999, according to the Commerce Department.While other tech jobs have been created in sectors such as software publishing, that growth is smaller than the losses in tech manufacturing.Since 2002, the number of technology startups has slowed, hurting job creation. In a 2014 study , economists Javier Miranda, John Haltiwanger and Ian Hathaway said the growth of tech startups accelerated to 113,000 in 2001 from 64,000 in 1992.That number slumped to 79,000 in 2011 and hasn't recovered, according to the economists' calculations using updated data. The causes include global competition and increased domestic regulation, says Mr. Haltiwanger, an economics professor at the University of Maryland.Another problem is that fewer tech companies have gone public , which can enrich early employees and spawn more jobs as companies grow.Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business, says there were 548 initial public offerings of technology-related companies from 2001 to 2015. From 1990 to 2000, by contrast, 1,853 went public.The latest generation of hot tech startups has attracted a mountain of venture-capital funding and gigantic valuations, led by Uber Technologies Inc., which was worth $68 billion as of June.The influx of wealth has created more prosperity in Silicon Valley but exemplifies the economic polarization rippling through America.WhatsApp had more than 450 million users world-wide when Facebook bought the messaging service for $19 billion in 2014 , turning founder Jan Koum into a billionaire several times over. At the time of the acquisition, WhatsApp had 55 employees.Economists call the phenomenon ""skill-biased technical change."" The spoils of growth go to those few people with skills and luck and who are best positioned to take advantage of new technology.The five largest U.S.-based technology companies by stock-market value--Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Oracle Corp.--are worth a combined $1.8 trillion today. That is 80% more than the five largest tech companies in 2000.Today's five giants have 22% fewer workers than their predecessors, or a total of 434,505 as of last year, compared with 556,523 at Cisco Systems Inc., Intel, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft in 2000.Amazon uses 45,000 small robots at about one-third of its U.S. warehouses to automate order processing. The robots look like bread boxes on wheels, lifting modular shelves stuffed with products and carrying the shelves to workers who pick out pieces.An Amazon spokesman says the company has added about 200,000 employees since it began using the robots in early 2012. Amazon has 268,000 employees world-wide.Robots aren't dexterous enough yet to identify different sized-packages, pick the right ones and place them safely in boxes, says Mr. Brynjolfsson, the MIT economist. That is the fundamental skill in warehousing. Researchers now are trying to automate that part of the job, too.In coming decades, machines are likely to replace new forms of routine work done by humans. From 1991 to 2001, the number of secretaries declined about 35%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of textile and apparel workers fell 37%.For a long time, those with bachelor's degrees in science seemed to be safe from automation-related layoffs because their cognitive knowledge was tough for computers to duplicate. Less-educated workers who dispense personal service, such as home health aides or masseuses, also seemed safe.Harvard University economist David Deming estimates that the hollowing-out of work spread to programmers, librarians and engineers between 2000 and 2012. As much as $2 trillion worth of human economic activity could be automated away using existing technologies, such as Amazon's robots, in coming years, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates.Knightscope Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., makes robots that serve as night watchmen . About three dozen are on patrol, including at shopping malls, corporate campuses such as Microsoft's in Mountain View and the new home arena of the Sacramento Kings. Knightscope clients pay $7 an hour per robot.""Robots don't complain,"" says Stacy Stephens, a Knightscope co-founder and vice president of marketing and sales. ""There's no pension. And there's no worker's comp,"" he adds.Write to Jon Hilsenrath at jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com and Bob Davis at bob.davis@wsj.comCredit: By Jon Hilsenrath and Bob Davis",11/11/16
The Weekend Interview with Scott Adams: Dilbert Explains Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812599117?accountid=12768,"Pleasanton, Calif. -- Can Donald Trump possibly win the presidency? For months Scott Adams was asking if Mr. Trump could possibly lose. Mr. Adams now believes the answer to the latter question is yes -- although, unlike most professional pundits, he hasn't written off the Republican nominee. And while he speculates Mr. Trump may have a tendency toward ""self-sabotage,"" he attributes Hillary Clinton's strong performance in recent polls mostly to her campaign's improvements rather than to Mr. Trump's missteps.Mr. Adams, 59, is best known as the creator of the popular Dilbert comic strip, a daily send-up of corporate culture. So why should anyone take a cartoonist's amateur political analysis seriously? Because Mr. Adams's unorthodox approach led him to take Mr. Trump seriously when the professionals were still scoffing.""The moment I realized there was something special was during the first debate,"" he tells me over coffee in the kitchen of his spacious suburban home. ""It was the Rosie O'Donnell moment."" Moderator Megyn Kelly had confronted Mr. Trump with the key premise of what Mr. Adams calls ""a gotcha question of the highest order"": ""You've called women you don't like 'fat pigs,' 'dogs,' 'slobs,' and 'disgusting animals.'""""I asked myself: How would anybody else have answered?"" Mr. Adams recalls. ""If you denied it, it would look weak. If you embraced it -- you really couldn't. There was nothing you could say. He was completely painted into a corner by his past comments. No one could get out of that. And then he did what no one could do -- he got out of it. He said: 'Only Rosie O'Donnell.'""If you watched the debate, you probably remember that it worked. Mr. Adams can explain why. Mr. Trump invoked a visual image, ""your most powerful persuasion sense."" The image was well-known, ""and it was a person, which is the best visual of all, because the brain is just attuned to faces and people. And he just drew all the energy out of the room, sucked all of it up, balled it all together, and just moved it over to this Rosie O'Donnell joke, and it just deflated the entire topic.""Was it mere luck? Mr. Adams considered the possibility but concluded after further observation that it was a matter of sophisticated technique. On his Dilbert.com blog, he started analyzing Mr. Trump's tactics through what he calls the ""Master Persuader filter.""Mr. Adams is something of a self-taught expert in persuasion theory and technique. In his 20s he took a course in hypnosis, and during his corporate career he attended seminars and read books on negotiation, communication, marketing and sales. He familiarized himself with the academic study of persuasion, in fields such as social psychology and behavioral economics.The central insight of these disciplines, Mr. Adams says, is that ""people are never rational. They rationalize. So after the fact they tell you why they did something. And there's plenty of science to support that. Now we can show that people actually make their decision before they come up with their reasons . . . . That was the perspective that I took when I saw Trump.""What seemed like madness to others, Mr. Adams recognized as method. Those cruel but seemingly random nicknames Mr. Trump gives his rivals? Mr. Adams calls them ""linguistic kill shots"" and says their purpose is not just to display dominance but to change the way voters think.It works -- including on Mr. Adams. Before the campaign, he says, ""I looked at Jeb Bush the way I think everyone else looked at him, which is [as] this competent, calm, secure executive type who is exactly who you need in times of trouble . . . . But as soon as [Mr. Trump] said 'low energy,' that's all you could see, because the visual kept reinforcing it."" What made it most effective was that ""it allowed confirmation bias going forward, meaning that anything you saw that Bush did that looked a little low-energy, you would immediately put in that framework.""Likewise, once Mr. Trump branded Ted Cruz ""Lyin' Ted,"" ""anything that Cruz said that sounded a little untrue would remind you of his nickname."" And ""Crooked Hillary"" is doubly effective, suggesting not only corruption but decrepitude: ""You see the picture of her slipping on the steps [in February], and your brain says, 'Hmmm, maybe 'cause there's something wrong with her body -- it's a little crooked.'""The nicknames also gain power from novelty: ""They haven't been used before in the political realm, so they're fresh. It's not like calling somebody either Hitler or a liberal or the things you've heard in the past.""So impressed was Mr. Adams that last October he made a prediction: Mr. Trump would win the nomination and the general election -- and in a landslide. He is of course aware of the latest polls, and he has adjusted his forecast accordingly. Earlier this month he wrote that ""for the sake of entertainment,"" he stands by his prediction of a Trump landslide. ""But it can only happen if something big changes. And something big changes about once a week."" He has thus qualified his bold prediction into a truism.That still sets him apart from the pros, most of whom are now convinced Mrs. Clinton is a shoo-in. ""At this point,"" Mr. Adams says, ""it's what I call a fair fight.""He says this is because Mrs. Clinton is campaigning much more effectively than before. ""Clinton had terrible persuasion game until somewhere around late spring, when it was clear that Bernie Sanders wasn't going to go all the way,"" he says. ""I am speculating that somebody was on the Sanders team who may have jumped ship to Clinton's team, because her persuasion game went from terrible to world-class almost instantly. And the best example of that is the word 'dark.'""You saw right after Trump did his convention speech that all of the [Clinton] surrogates used the same word almost instantly. You know, 'dark'? So somebody with skill had obviously gotten word out to use that word. And if you look at it, it's the same engineering as Trump's. It's a higher level than what you normally see. 'Dark' is a Rorschach test . . . . Anything you see Trump do -- from getting mad at a baby, to saying something about the Second Amendment and Hillary Clinton, to his immigration plans -- they all seem like they could fit into this 'dark' label, once you've heard it. It was a fresh word you don't hear in politics . . . and it fits all future confirmation bias. So anything he does in the future, you're going to say, 'Yeah, that was a little dark.'""He thinks ""dark"" was ""probably the work of a trained cognitive psychologist, behavioral psychologist -- someone who has deep skills. I've referred to who I think it is as Godzilla. And I think Godzilla entered the race sometime around June."" I ask for Godzilla's real name, and Mr. Adams answers: Robert Cialdini, a social psychologist at Arizona State University. Mr. Adams describes Mr. Cialdini's ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,"" first published in 1984, as ""the flagship book"" on the subject.Mr. Cialdini didn't reply to my email, but he was part of a team of behavioral scientists who advised President Obama's re-election campaign. ""If I were to judge Obama's persuasion game, I would say A-plus,"" Mr. Adams says. ""Coincidence? Almost certainly not. He had the right people consulting. Is it a coincidence that Clinton's game went from terrible to world-class almost instantly? She's largely abandoned policies and experience and, you know, blah blah blah, and now it's 'I'm going to scare you to death about Trump.' . . . And he continues to fall into their confirmation-bias trap by saying things off the cuff that can be taken out of context easily and misinterpreted.""How, then, could Mr. Trump come back? For one thing, Mr. Adams recommends he make a show of empathy, his apparent lack of which is central to his detractors' fear of him. I note that he missed an obvious opportunity when he went on the attack against Khizr Khan -- the Muslim father of a fallen Army captain, whose denunciation of Mr. Trump electrified the Democratic Convention -- without acknowledging the family's loss or the son's sacrifice.Mr. Adams grants the point and observes: ""That's where we have to wonder if there's some self-sabotage going on, because the right answer was available to him and to everybody. Almost anybody could have gotten that right. It bordered on intentional. I wouldn't say it was intentional, but when you watch it, you have to scratch your head and say: Of all the things you could have said, maybe a little softness on the fallen soldier would have gone a long way.""The debates could work in Mr. Trump's favor, for Mr. Adams believes he is faster on his feet than Mrs. Clinton: ""He can do it on demand. She probably still has to be coached -- 'say this, don't say that.' In a debate, if things go not as expected and not as they prepared, Trump's got an advantage, because he's just going to somewhat instinctively go to a simple, visual, provocative thing that benefits his side. She probably won't. She will probably default to some data, some reason, some experience kind of argument, which would be less effective.""The latter type of argument, ironically, could be effective for Mr. Trump: ""The expectations are so low in terms of what he might have mastered in policy and facts and truth that if he simply showed up a little bit practiced, and a little bit studied, so that if she brings up an issue and he throws some facts at her that pass the fact checkers -- for the first time -- he doesn't have to be as good as her.""As for Mrs. Clinton, ""she should stick to her attack that's working. Her recent gains are based on fear and painting him as an unstable personality. If she can get him to do anything that seems outrageous during the debate, that will add to the confirmation bias.""Mr. Adams suspects Mr. Trump's poll numbers are depressed owing to ""shy Trump supporters,"" who favor him but won't admit it to others because it is socially unacceptable -- or perhaps who have decided to vote for Mr. Trump but haven't yet developed a rationalization, so they think of themselves as undecided.In an indirect way Mr. Adams's experience illustrates the power of social-acceptability bias. In June he formally endorsed Mrs. Clinton, ""for my personal safety."" It sounds like a put-on, but Mr. Adams insists he's serious: It's ""definitely funny,"" he allows, but ""it's only a joke by coincidence.""He notes that detractors ""have literally been comparing Trump to Hitler -- an actual comparison to Hitler . . . . That is a call for assassination. There's no other way you can [expletive] interpret that . . . . And you've seen how many Trump people have been beaten by crowbars for wearing his shirt, or beaten up [outside a rally] in San Jose, my backyard.""He tells me he hasn't had any scary face-to-face encounters with Trump haters -- ""I don't go out much, and when I do, people don't recognize me"" -- but he says: ""I didn't want to be tainted by the Hitler brush . . . . A few dozen times, people referred to me publicly as [Nazi propagandist] Joseph Goebbels, just because I was talking about Trump's persuasion skills, not his policies or anything. To me that was a call to violence. It's an indirect call, but it's saying if you kill Joseph Goebbels, you're doing the country a favor.""Yet if its purpose was serious, the endorsement was not, in the sense that there is no substance behind it. Mr. Adams tells me he doesn't vote, disagrees with both candidates on policy, and thinks both are too old: ""There's no 70-year-old I would think is capable to be president of the United States."" And he hasn't let up in his praise for Mr. Trump's skills.Even so, his empty gesture had its desired effect. ""The weird thing is, people don't care why,"" Mr. Adams says. ""They only care if you're on their side. So it actually made most of the problems go away. Almost instantly, people stopped calling me Joseph Goebbels. In terms of my safety, it absolutely worked, exactly as I imagined it would work . . . . I'm actually safer because I've endorsed Hillary Clinton.""People are never rational, are they?---Mr. Taranto, a member of the Journal's editorial board, writes the daily Best of the Web column for WSJ.com.Credit: By James Taranto",11/11/16
"Trump's Dawn Shake-Up --- Under pressure over Ukraine, campaign chief resigns in an early- morning phone call",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812591696?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump was in an SUV speeding to the airport at 6:30 Friday morning when he called campaign Chairman Paul Manafort.They discussed the good news -- favorable reviews of a speech the Republican presidential nominee had given the night before in North Carolina. Then they turned to the bad news: Mr. Trump expressed concern that the attention being paid to consulting Mr. Manafort had done for a pro-Russian party in Ukraine had become a major distraction that could hurt his campaign.""I don't want to be a distraction,"" said Mr. Manafort, who had been warned the previous night about growing unease in the Trump camp over the Ukraine issue. He said he was prepared to resign immediately to ""get out of the way.""Mr. Trump accepted the resignation and thanked Mr. Manafort for his work, according to a person familiar with the discussion.That conversation completed a weeklong overhaul of the Trump campaign as the candidate and his family tried to steady the enterprise in time for the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the general-election race. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump named a new campaign chief executive, Breitbart News Chairman Stephen Bannon, and a new campaign manager, Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, in an attempt to build a new structure to help him run in a more disciplined way, but one still consistent with the New York businessman's outsider status.Along the way, Mr. Trump also is testing out a new campaign style, one in which he would remain combative, but in a more controlled way, according to people familiar with the discussions. On Thursday night, he expressed ""regret"" for sometimes ""saying the wrong thing,"" and for the first time began using teleprompters for remarks at his rallies.By Friday, Mr. Trump, who had become unhappy and irritated in private, appeared happier, and his family and advisers were breathing more easily, said people familiar with the situation. ""He owned this week,"" son Eric said in an interview.The overhaul, one of several the Trump campaign has attempted in the past few months, was weeks in the making, and came after a sharp decline in poll numbers for the GOP candidate in his race against Democrat Hillary Clinton.Not all Republicans believe this latest move will help revive his campaign. The shakeup is a ""disaster,"" said Stuart Stevens, who was the top strategist for the 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. ""It's like the fall of Lehman Brothers. When you think the campaign can't get any worse, it will.""Mr. Trump had dominated the Republican primary season, but he grew increasingly troubled in the weeks before and after the GOP convention in July, as he came to believe that political pros, including Mr. Manafort, were trying to remake him, advisers and family members say.Mr. Trump needed Mr. Manafort to run the Republican convention in Cleveland, which had once threatened to become a debacle in which the Trump nomination would be actively fought by his foes in the party. Once the convention passed, though, Mr. Trump began tuning out Mr. Manafort and his small team, according to several aides and advisers.The result was several weeks of drift and a series of self-inflicted wounds, including a feud with the family of a Muslim-American soldier who died in Iraq.By last week, Mr. Manafort realized that he no longer was helping his candidate in the manner he wanted to improve on his message. In a meeting with Mr. Trumpin his office, Mr. Manafort said they needed to bring in new people. The two men agreed that broadening the campaign leadership team was a good idea, with one caveat insisted upon by Mr. Trump: There wouldn't be any staffers who wanted to ""change"" him. Instead, Mr. Trump wanted to stick with his outsider mode.Then, last Saturday night, at a fundraiser at the East Hampton, N.Y., home of New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Mr. Trump met privately with billionaire hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah. They recommended that Mr. Trump install new people at the top -- fast -- and recommended he speak with Mr. Bannon, according to a person familiar with the meeting.Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort were already scheduled to meet the next day at Mr. Trump's residence at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., with former Fox News head Roger Ailes and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, according to a person familiar with the meeting. When the campaign manager arrived, Mr. Bannon was already there -- to Mr. Manafort's surprise.Mr. Manafort is a longtime GOP consultant; Mr. Bannon is an anti-establishment firebrand. During the afternoon conversation, the polar opposites found common ground: If Mr. Trump wanted to win, he had to focus on Mrs. Clinton and stay on message.Mr. Trump asked Mr. Bannon, who had produced a movie titled ""Clinton Cash"" and strongly supported Mr. Trump on his website, if he would be willing to help the campaign.After that, the changes began unfolding rapidly, according to several people familiar with the events of the next few days.That Sunday night, Mr. Manafort invited Mr. Bannon to his apartment in Trump Tower to discuss a leadership role for the Breitbart News executive.On Monday morning, Mr. Trump and the two men talked about Mr. Bannon taking a new position as CEO to run the campaign, while Mr. Manafort would remain as chairman. Both Messrs. Manafort and Bannon strongly recommended elevating Ms. Conway, who had been an adviser for several weeks, to campaign manager.The Mercers also favored Ms. Conway, who has run a super PAC backing Sen. Ted Cruz in which Mr. Mercer had spent more than $13 million.By Tuesday morning, Ms. Conway accepted the new position, and the campaign announced the shake-up, without calling it that.Mr. Trump also agreed to use teleprompters at his rallies, where he had made many of his most controversial remarks during unscripted appearances. He had refused to use teleprompters when Mr. Manafort had suggested that weeks earlier.Then this week, Mr. Trump agreed to soften his approach -- slightly.His new campaign team, including Mr. Bannon and Ms. Conway, told him he didn't need to keep showing that he came up through a tough real-estate and deal-making background. He agreed to express ""regret"" for statements that had caused pain, which he did Thursday night.After that speech Thursday night, more news reports surfaced about Mr. Manafort's Ukrainian consulting. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and close adviser, called Mr. Manafort. They discussed how the continuing Manafort drama was interfering with Mr. Trump's message.Mr. Manafort said he didn't want to hurt the campaign.Mr. Manafort put the finishing touches on a plan for Trump television ads starting on Friday and staffing operations in 12 targeted states. Then, he talked with Mr. Trump, and his formal association with the campaign was over.Credit: By Monica Langley",11/11/16
Election 2016: Trump Camp Says New Tone Is a First Step --- Republicans hope the nominee's latest reboot helps him climb out from polling gap,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812591584?accountid=12768,"The departure of Donald Trump's chief strategist completed the latest reboot of the Republican presidential nominee's campaign, but Mr. Trump remains under pressure to make the latest changes stick and show an immediate return amid a widening deficit in public opinion polls.""It's not too late for Trump, but the path is narrow, and time is running out,"" said Neil Newhouse, the lead pollster for 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.Amid a series of self-generated controversies, Mr. Trump has trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in every major poll this month. A survey released Thursday by Fox 5 Atlanta showed the two candidates in a virtual tie in Georgia, which hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 24 years.The rising signs of danger for his candidacy helped spark a makeover of the Trump campaign, culminating on Friday with Paul Manafort stepping down as campaign chairman and chief strategist.The changes have renewed Mr. Trump's energy, aides said, and resulted in some immediate adjustments on the campaign trail that supporters said are aimed at suburban voters who increasingly have told pollsters that they favor Mrs. Clinton.""There is no mistaking the energy of this week,"" said Kellyanne Conway, who took over as Trump campaign manager on Wednesday. Ms. Conway said in an interview that the changes had helped turned Mr. Trump back into a ""buoyant candidate.""Besides the shake-up, which included installing Steve Bannon, chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News, as the campaign's chief executive, there have been other changes.After refusing to spend money on TV ads, the campaign aired its first commercial this week in the general election. The ad, which began airing Friday in five battleground states, took the tack that fellow Republicans have been urging for months: It put the focus on Mrs. Clinton and drew a contrast between the two candidates' policies.Mr. Trump's freewheeling campaign rallies, characterized this year by personal attacks on fellow Republicans, were reined in this past week. In North Carolina on Thursday, Mr. Trump took the unfamiliar step of saying he regretted past comments that ""may have caused personal pain.""Mr. Trump hasn't said specifically what he regretted, but supporters viewed the statement as a sign of a more disciplined candidate and said such steps may help prompt voters to take a new look at the candidate. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll earlier this month, 61% of registered voters said they had a negative view of Mr. Trump, compared with 53% who said the same of Mrs. Clinton.""What he's done this past week and especially last night will have a profound impact of voters' view of him and his message,"" said Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.).Mr. Trump on Friday toured the flood devastation in the Baton Rouge, La., region. Dressed in a blue blazer and ""Make America Great Again"" cap, he smiled and gave the ""thumbs up"" as he handed out boxes of supplies to flood victims. Later Friday in Michigan, Mr. Trump attempted to make a direct appeal to African-American voters, who overwhelmingly back Mrs. Clinton.""If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting exactly the same results,"" he said. ""You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?""Joel Benenson, a pollster for Mrs. Clinton, mocked Mr. Trump for making the appeal in a community where fewer than 1% of residents are black. ""You don't make a pitch to minorities in a town that is 95% white,"" Mr. Benenson said. ""People who have been watching him insult and denigrate people of color for the past 18 months will see this is another Trump con, and will see right through it.""Republicans have heard pledges of change before from Mr. Trump's team, including from Mr. Manafort, who told party leaders in April that Mr. Trump would tone down the aggressive demeanor that became his trademark during the primary campaign. But while Mr. Trump has started to deliver more policy-focused speeches in recent months, he often followed those with controversial comments that dominated news coverage.""I don't want him to take a 180-degree turn,"" said Rep. Tom Marino, Mr. Trump's Pennsylvania campaign chairman. ""People like the idea that this is a guy who says what's on his mind . . . . He just needs to put more emphasis on ending corporate tax breaks and beefing up border security. He's doing that now, but I want him to work harder at that.""---Reid J.

Election 2016: Trump Tax Plan Could Be Windfall --- Interest deductions and fast write-offs would aid developers like him who use debt,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812385341?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's emerging tax plan could benefit leveraged real-estate companies like the one he runs with new and substantial subsidies.The Republican presidential nominee appears poised to combine two policies that House Republicans -- and tax analysts from both parties -- say shouldn't be paired: letting businesses deduct interest, and allowing expensing, or immediate write-offs, for investments in equipment and buildings. Current law requires businesses to spread those deductions over multiple years.The result would provide negative tax rates for investments financed with debt, creating incentives for companies to pursue projects that wouldn't make sense economically without the tax benefits.A business would be able to generate significant losses in the first year of an investment and then generate ongoing interest deductions. Those losses could be carried forward and used to offset future income.""It is insane to do expensing and continue to allow interest deductions. That's like the closest I can think of to a bipartisan sin among tax nerds,"" said Lily Batchelder, a New York University law professor and a former aide to President Barack Obama.Mr. Trump hasn't officially announced the proposal yet as he revamps his tax plan to limit the projected revenue losses from the version he released in 2015. In a speech last week in Detroit, Mr. Trump said he supported full expensing -- which is normally combined with sharp limits on interest deductibility -- aligning himself with House Republicans and the plans of several of his defeated Republican rivals.But the candidate also is wary of eliminating interest deductions, according to Stephen Moore, a Trump adviser, although Mr. Moore says the plan is still negotiable.Steve Mnuchin, a Trump adviser and national finance chairman, said the campaign was still working on details of the expensing proposal. The goal, he said, will be to tie expensing to job creation and new investment and not, for example, purchases of existing leveraged real-estate portfolios.Expensing has become increasingly popular in Republican policy circles over the past few years as a way to stimulate business spending and spur economic growth. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation said expensing would increase long-run gross domestic product by more than 5% and is efficient because it only rewards new capital and reduces the marginal effective tax rate on new investment to zero.Some analysts, including those at the Tax Foundation, say interest deductions can be appropriately combined with expensing. They note many recipients of interest, such as banks, would pay taxes on the interest income they receive from the businesses taking deductions.Democrats are wary of expensing due to the potential revenue loss -- and are dubious that speeding up deductions for capital investment would have much benefit in an era when low interest rates mean deductions today and deductions in the future have similar value.""A huge corporation that is generating a lot of profits is going to have an advantage over a start-up in using these benefits,"" said Don Susswein, a principal with RSM, a tax, audit and consulting firm.Mr. Trump hasn't released his tax returns, so it isn't clear exactly how he would be affected. But that kind of policy might be particularly beneficial to someone such as Mr. Trump, who could generate investment and interest deductions from real-estate investments and then use those losses to offset taxable income from licensing deals, book royalties and speeches.Credit: By Richard Rubin",11/11/16
"Donald Trump as Nixon's Heir; The clearest precedent for Trump is the anti-elite, big-government conservatism of Nixon",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1838250645?accountid=12768,"If you ask Republicans what their party stands for, most will say conservatism. The trouble comes in trying to define what that means.Which should come first--nationalism or resisting the growth of the state? Is the existing social order sound, or is our moral decay so serious that more radical solutions are needed? Is the wealth accumulating in our big coastal cities a sign of entrepreneurial vitality or of corruption and cronyism? Donald Trump's rise has put these cleavages into sharp relief, but they have been shaping the party since the Eisenhower era.In the 1950s, Republicans faced a fateful choice. Would they reconcile themselves to the New Deal or seek to roll it back? Dwight Eisenhower, a man who owed nothing to the GOP, had little patience for small-government orthodoxy. He called for a ""modern Republicanism"" that would use government to build a vast network of highways and world-class research universities.Instead of repealing Social Security, Eisenhower entrenched it, and he sought to marginalize the anti-statist Old Right, a faction of the party that continued to see the growing reach of the federal government as a grave evil. At the time, it wasn't hard to imagine that the Old Right would eventually wither away.That didn't happen, of course. Elements of the Old Right re-emerged in the new ""fusionism"" championed by William F. Buckley Jr.'s National Review. Unlike the Old Right, this new conservative movement abandoned isolationism and promised to wage a more aggressive war on Soviet imperialism. It also gave new life to libertarian ideas while offering a home to moral traditionalists, who feared that a more centralized state would undermine the cohesion and autonomy of America's families, churches and small communities.Within the Buckley circle, there was a tension between two broad tendencies. The more libertarian-mind conservatives, like Frank Meyer and Buckley himself, were on one side of the divide. On the other was James Burnham, Buckley's most trusted lieutenant.To Burnham, reflexive hostility to the state was simply naive. As he saw it, the world was divided into armed camps, and it was inevitable that the rival superpowers would build powerful governments that, to at least some degree, would direct national life. Styling himself an arch-realist, Burnham believed that federal social programs were here to stay. In practice, this led him to look upon more moderate Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon more favorably than did his libertarian colleagues, who flocked to Barry Goldwater, a man fiercely devoted to the anti-statist credo.By the late 1960s, Nixon saw an opportunity for a new coalition, which would combine traditional Republican constituencies with voters in the South and West who had once been the bedrock of the New Deal coalition. Drawing on Eisenhower's modern Republicanism, Nixon would make peace with the New Deal and with activist government, having concluded that Goldwaterism was a dead end.But Nixon was also able to capitalize on growing resentment toward America's elite power centers, a sentiment that had fueled Goldwater's insurgent 1964 presidential campaign and was dividing the Democratic Party. Nixon believed that America had been betrayed by feckless, out-of-touch elites who had allowed the country to descend into chaos, and he effectively exploited both racial desegregation and crime as wedge issues. He promised to use the power of government on behalf of decent, law-abiding people--but not to dismantle the power of government.If all of this sounds vaguely Trumpian, it should. Donald Trump is Nixon's obvious heir.Think of a two-by-two grid describing rival approaches to government among conservatives. One axis separates those who look favorably on educated elites from those who do not. The other separates those who embrace the power of government from those who see government as the problem.Eisenhower represented the pro-elite and pro-government quadrant, and Goldwater represented its opposite, the anti-elite and antigovernment quadrant. Nixon tried to reconcile the two Republican tendencies by positioning himself as anti-elite and pro-government. For all Nixon's flaws, this proved a formidable political formula, one that might have endured had Watergate not intervened. The Republican Party of the 1970s and 1980s might have belonged to statist nationalists such as the Texan John Connally, a former Democrat who was a particular favorite of Nixon.Instead, it was Ronald Reagan who emerged from the Republican tumult of the 1970s. Always a chameleon-like figure, Reagan managed to persuade libertarians that he was one of them and Republican pragmatists that he was a man with whom they could do business.The truth is that, like Eisenhower and Nixon before him, Reagan made his peace with the New Deal and, for the most part, the Great Society. He won the presidency in 1980 and 1984 largely by persuading middle-of-the-road voters that he had left his unrepentant Goldwaterism behind. While in office, Reagan had no compunctions about demanding that the rich pay their fair share of taxes, or pushing for protectionist measures to safeguard his middle-class base.Yet many of the Republicans who came of age under Reagan, from George W. Bush to younger figures like Marco Rubio, failed to appreciate the hybrid nature of his presidency. They endeavored to be more Reaganite than Reagan himself. At times, their neo-Reaganism resembled an inverted Nixonism that positioned the GOP as pro-elite--in their embrace of high-end tax cuts and mass immigration--and antigovernment, in their zeal to shrink popular social programs.The simplest way to understand Mr. Trump is that he has turned back the clock to the Nixon formula. Leaving aside what to make of his character and temperament, it is hard to deny that he has been proven right where so many other Republicans have been proven wrong. In our current economic and social reality, neo-Nixonism has more electoral appeal than neo-Reaganism.Mr. Salam is the executive editor of National Review.Credit: By Reihan Salam",11/14/16
"Donald Trump Win Has Investors Selling in Emerging Markets; Money that had flowed far afield in search of yield stages an about-face, as traders expect higher rates in the U.S.",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837998087?accountid=12768,"Investors are dumping assets in emerging markets around the world, as Donald Trump's election victory upends another long-profitable trade.A fresh selloff rolled from Asia into Europe, Africa and Latin America as the day progressed Friday. Stocks ended the day down 4% in Indonesia, while South Africa's FTSE JSE index fell by 2.3%. Argentina's Merval stock index had tumbled 3.6% in late afternoon trading.Currencies took a beating, too. Even the Russian ruble, which held up in the election's immediate aftermath, dropped by 0.6% against the U.S. dollar.Investors this year poured billions of dollars into emerging markets, seeking relief from the rock-bottom yields prevailing elsewhere around the world. But Mr. Trump's election has changed that calculus. His emphasis on infrastructure spending and tax cuts has sparked a rally in U.S. stocks and sent benchmark Treasury yields sharply higher.With better yields now available in developed markets and expectations that the Federal Reserve could have to raise key interest rates more aggressively, rather than the slow and gradual approach many analysts had been expecting, investors have a more compelling case to keep their money at home.""Higher rates in the U.S. will naturally raise the bar for capital flows to emerging markets,"" said Mirza Baig, head of foreign-exchange and interest-rate strategy at BNP Paribas in Singapore.Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasurys surged above 2% this week for the first time since the beginning of the year. U.S. bond markets were closed Friday for Veterans Day.""The previous shallow hiking cycle is probably not going to happen,"" said Mark Baker, an emerging-markets portfolio manager at Standard Life Investments in Hong Kong. ""I think there's a narrative around tighter global liquidity conditions that could become more important once again.""In that kind of environment, emerging-markets investors could rethink investments in countries that are reliant on foreign capital, such as Turkey and South Africa, Mr. Baker said.The South African rand fell by more than 1% against the greenback on Friday. The yield on the country's sovereign bond maturing in 2026 rose to 9%, its highest since early September.The yield on South Korea's benchmark 10-year government bond climbed to 1.94% from 1.821% on Thursday. Bond yields rise as prices fall.Latin America has been particularly hard-hit, given the region's close trading and immigration links with the U.S. A Brazilian government bond maturing in 2026 reached a yield of 5.25%, its highest since June. The Brazilian real's 5.3% decline against the dollar Thursday was the currency's largest daily drop in five years.The Mexican peso is down more than 12% since the election. A 2.7% slump in Indonesia's rupiah prompted intervention by the country's central bank.Global investors were also dumping emerging-markets sovereign debt. The dollar-denominated J.P. Morgan emerging-markets bond exchange-traded fund experienced its sharpest outflow on record on Thursday, with $300 million exiting the fund.Asian companies had rushed to issue bonds in dollars before an expected U.S. rate increase in December. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against their home currencies, that debt will now likely become more burdensome to repay.Emerging markets are sturdier than they were during the so-called taper tantrum of 2013, when worries that the Fed would pull back from its bond-buying program triggered heavy outflows. Current-account deficits in India and Indonesia have narrowed, for example.Still, investors remain cautious given the uncertain outlook for the direction of Treasurys.""If Treasury yields continue to march higher, eventually that will put pressure on emerging markets,"" said Ashley Perrott, head of pan-Asia fixed income at UBS Asset Management in Singapore.

Election 2016: White Retirees Bolster Trump in Florida --- Influx helps offset boost to Democrats from state's growing minority communities,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814537037?accountid=12768,"THE VILLAGES, Fla. -- Fast-growing minority communities give Democrats an increasing advantage in Florida, one of the most heated battlegrounds in the presidential election. A different demographic trend is helping to keep the state competitive for Donald Trump: a new influx of white retirees, such as Art Donnelly.Mr. Donnelly and his wife moved last year from Long Island, N.Y., to a retirement community here, where he has attended tea-party gatherings and Republican club meetings. He said he plans to get more involved in helping to elect Mr. Trump, the GOP nominee.""Politicians in general are too focused on how they can help themselves and their inner circles,"" said 67-year-old Mr. Donnelly, a former consultant in the intelligence community. ""I don't think Trump is going to be so easily controlled by the power brokers.""Florida, the largest swing state, is being keenly targeted by the presidential campaigns. While Democrat Hillary Clinton can lose the state and find other paths to victory, it is seen as a must-win for Mr. Trump.New arrivals like Mr. Donnelly help explain why the Florida race remains tight in polls. The most recent, a Mason-Dixon survey released Friday, showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by only two points among likely voters, a slim margin helped in part by his lead of over 20 points among white seniors.President Barack Obama won Florida by less than a percentage point in 2012 amid a poor showing among white voters. Since then, the terrain has turned more favorable to Democrats. The share of eligible voters who are non-Hispanic white has fallen from 67% in 2012 to a projected 64% this year, according to the nonpartisan States of Change demography project.That is due to more Hispanic and minority voters, as well as to a big influx of residents from economically troubled Puerto Rico, who are eligible to vote and tend to back Democrats.Some 96,000 Hispanics arrived in Florida from abroad in 2014, including many from Puerto Rico.That trend is partly offset by another set of new residents -- white retirees, many from GOP-leaning areas of the country. Though Florida has long been a destination for white retirees, they have arrived in larger numbers in recent years as a stronger economy and rising property values made it easier to move, economists and local officials say.A net 7,800 white, non-Hispanic residents left Florida in the recession year of 2008, but whites streamed back as the economy picked up, topping anet 94,000 arrivals in 2014.""The interplay between the share of the white vote and the share of the Hispanic vote will keep the state relatively competitive for a while,"" said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, who managed Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign in Florida.Bill Garner, campaign manager for Mr. Trump in Sumter County, which is home to The Villages, said that support for Mr. Trump remains strong in the area, despite weeks of intense criticism of the candidate.In other parts of the state, Democratic prospects have seen a boost from Hispanic inflows, though the party faces a challenge in motivating newcomers to register and vote.""We have folks here who are just worried about landing a job, finding a place to live,"" said Sami Haiman-Marrero, who has worked on civic-engagement projects aimed at Puerto Ricans.(See related article: ""Two Areas That Are a Big Draw"" -- WSJ August 29, 2016)Credit: By Arian Campo-Flores and Paul Overberg",11/14/16
Election 2016: Trump's Shift Isn't Issue for Many Backers,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814282437?accountid=12768,"Some rank-and-file supporters of Donald Trump reacted with a shrug to the Republican presidential candidate's recent moves to moderate his tone on a signature issue of cracking down on illegal immigration.Trump loyalists who have attended his rallies say their faith in the candidate hasn't been shaken by his recent statements suggesting that he would ease his plan to deport all who are here illegally.""I believe Donald Trump will do what is right for America, its citizens and those here illegally,"" said Russ Price, a Trump supporter from Walled Lake, Mich. ""I trust him with whatever decision he makes.""That points to one big factor that could limit the political fallout from Mr. Trump's controversial change in tone, if not in policy, that has outraged some conservative activists.Many voters are drawn to Mr. Trump's strong personality, not the details of his policies, and they care more about defeating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton than about any particular stance.""Trump supporters don't care what he does or what he says, because there is no way they are going to do anything that helps elect Hillary Clinton,"" conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh said Wednesday.It is a variation on the theme that Mr. Trump has an apparentability to survive controversies that would have felled other candidates. As Mr. Trump joked early this year, ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?""Mr. Trump's immigration shifts come amid a broader reset of his campaign, which seems to be off-loading some of his signature elements. He has ditched his freewheeling ad-lib style on the stump, in favor of reading his speeches from a teleprompter.Having long bragged about self-funding his campaign, he is now fundraising from big donors. He has elevated a pollster to be his campaign manager, after spending months trashing polls (except on the days when he hailed them).All that may serve to make Mr. Trump seem less Trumpy, leaving some supporters a bit nostalgic. ""I liked the old Trump,"" said Brandon Hughes, 28 years old, of Jackson, Mich., who attended a rally in Dimondale last Friday. ""He's dialing it back.""But many Trump fans are also pragmatic and see the need for him to make changes to broaden his appeal to swing voters.""If Mr. Trump does soften his stance on illegal immigrants, and not make drastic changes, it will simply upset some supporters of his,"" said Michael Cartwright, 26, of Indian Trail, N.C., who attended Mr. Trump's rally in Charlotte last week.""But I believe that if he did, he would be changing it to draw in more supporters, which at this point in the election process is what really matters,"" Mr. Cartwright said.""I laugh when I hear some political observers speculate that Trump voters will shed him if he takes a position they don't like,"" said Henry Barbour, a Mississippi member of the Republican National Committee.""They are missing the big political tidal wave screaming for total transformation of Washington,"" said Mr. Barbour, who attended a fundraiser and rally for Mr. Trump in Jackson on Wednesday. ""People are sick and tired of no one in Washington having their back, and now, finally, they feel like Trump is someone they can count on.""Credit: By Janet Hook",11/14/16
"Election 2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: In Clinton vs. Trump, Who Is Inspired to Vote?",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814843423?accountid=12768,"Political debate has become so nasty, and everyone has become so numb to the nastiness, that it's easy to overlook this reality: Last Thursday may have been the most negative day in modern presidential campaign history.The two major party nominees for president -- not their surrogates, or their TV ads, but the candidates themselves -- leveled the most searing of personal attacks on each other.Republican Donald Trump charged that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ""lies and she smears"" and said her actions ""constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise."" Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump ""has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia"" and that ""his disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.""And it's only August.Aside from what this exchange says about the level of public discourse, it also raises a more practical question: Is this the sort of campaign that's actually going to inspire people to turn out and vote?The answer will be crucial in determining the outcome -- and, like everything else in this campaign, may run counter to conventional wisdom.It once was thought that negative campaigns depressed voter turnout. People were turned off by a nasty tone, tuned out the race and found something better to do on Election Day. If that is the case, we should be headed for record low turnout this year.Yet evidence in recent years calls that conventional wisdom into doubt. And it may have to be thrown out the window entirely in 2016.""Fear and hatred are the strongest emotions in politics,"" says Charlie Cook, a veteran nonpartisan political analyst. ""There's a feeling the stakes are very, very high. People who aren't normally engaged in politics are fascinated.""The emotion that tends to suppress turnout is apathy, Mr. Cook notes, and apathy arises from a belief that there's no real difference between the candidates. ""I haven't heard that this year,"" he said. As a result, he predicts ""average to high"" levels of turnout.If nothing else, this year's campaign will test the question of how motivated voters can be to vote against a candidate rather than for one.That's because dissatisfaction with the two main candidates is at historic levels. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 37% of Democrats said they would have preferred that somebody other than Mrs. Clinton become the Democratic nominee, and a resounding 52% of Republicans said they would have preferred somebody other than Mr. Trump.More than six in 10 reported negative feelings toward Mr. Trump personally; more than five in 10 had negative feelings toward Mrs. Clinton personally.Those certainly are numbers suggesting the desire to stop one of the candidates will be as high as the desire to actually elect one of them.But in the end, will that be enough to get people to the polls? The early evidence is mixed. When the Journal/NBC News poll asked people in July to rate their interest in this year's campaign, 60% said their interest was at the highest level; that was down slightly from the same point in each of the last three presidential cycles.Moreover, so many voters answering the Journal/NBC poll volunteered that they had decided not to vote for either major presidential candidate -- not that they were undecided, but rather that they had made a conscious decision not to vote for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton -- that such a response was added as its own data point. In early August, 8% offered this ""neither"" response.Some of those folks may be headed toward either Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson or Green Party candidate Jill Stein; add them to the mix and they together attract 15% of the vote right now.That suggests a lot of turned-off voters. Yet turnout actually was high during this year's primary-election season, which was held amid a climate of negativity similar to the one prevailing now. More than 57.6 million people, 28.5% of estimated eligible voters, cast ballots in presidential primaries this year, the Pew Research Center reports, a turnout just below the record level of 2008.All this makes it hard to predict who will and who won't be inspired to vote. Evidence suggests Mrs. Clinton has a hard core of support of just over 40% of the electorate, and Mr. Trump has a hard core of support of something under 40% of the electorate.That leaves perhaps 20% of the electorate that is persuadable. Right now, it may be too much to hope they find a candidate to be for. Whether being against one of them proves motivation enough to show up is one of the keys to the 2016 campaign.Credit: By Gerald F. Seib",11/15/16
Election 2016: Trump's Unorthodoxy Extends to Spending,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814842707?accountid=12768,"Republican Donald Trump has said he isn't interested in running a traditional presidential campaign. Campaign-finance records show he's not: Half of the campaign's 10 highest-paid consultants over the course of the election had never previously worked for a presidential campaign.Just one of Democrat Hillary Clinton's top 10 consultants had no presidential campaign experience, according to a Wall Street Journal review of Federal Election Commission records through July that focused on firms paid for consulting services, including on field, digital and strategic efforts.In charting his own course, the New York businessman is testing whether the traditional, massive networks created to conduct presidential bids are necessary in the digital age and the era of 24-hour cable news programming.Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who advised Mitt Romney in 2008, said that past work for presidential candidates was a top quality the campaign sought, since experienced consultants brought both know-how and the ability to ""prosper in a very high-stress environment.""He said Mr. Trump's reliance on relatively inexperienced consultants may also have come out of necessity, not choice. ""There are a lot of political operatives who don't want to work for Donald Trump,"" Mr. Madden said.Stuart Jolly, whose consulting firm has been paid $126,000 by the Trump campaign to hire staff in targeted states, said he didn't necessarily look for veterans of prior campaigns. ""Trump wants people with fire in the belly. Loyalty is right up there at the top,"" said Mr. Jolly, who now works for a pro-Trump super PAC.Added Don McGahn, general counsel for Mr. Trump's campaign: ""Fresh thinking is good.""In July, the Trump campaign's largest payment was to a San Antonio-based web marketing company, Giles-Parscale, run by Brad Parscale, who serves as Mr. Trump's digital director. The company was paid $8.3 million in July -- up from $543,000 in June.While Mr. Parscale and his firm are newcomers to a presidential campaign, he has worked since 2011 for Mr. Trump's companies in various capacities. His firm designed websites for Trump International Realty and Melania Trump as well as for the Eric Trump Foundation.""They hired me for the first couple pieces and I kept proving that I had the answers and was able to get things done,"" Mr. Parscale said in an interview. ""I earned my way.""Mr. Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, had never previously worked for a presidential campaign, though he has worked for the Republican National Committee. Social media director, Dan Scavino, also is new to presidential politics. But he was a familiar face for Mr. Trump, for whom he served as a golf caddie at a Trump golf club in Westchester County, N.Y., according to Mr. Scavino's LinkedIn page.After effectively clinching his party's nomination in May, Mr. Trump hired Paul Manafort, who had worked for GOP presidential candidates dating back to Gerald Ford in 1976, to head his campaign. But Mr. Manafort resigned earlier this month, after Mr. Trump had elevated Stephen Bannon, a media executive with no experience working for a presidential campaign, and Kellyanne Conway, a veteran pollster who became a first-time campaign manager.Mr. Trump has frequently bragged about running a frugal operation. Yet his expenses have ramped up in recent months, even as he avoided spending money on TV ads and building up his field operations. The RNC is expected to create the grass-roots network to help his campaign and other GOP candidates.Mr. Trump's spending has drawn note for the level of funds -- $15 million, or about 17% of the roughly $90 million spent through July -- paid to companies linked to himself or his children, or to reimburse their travel expenses.Mr. McGahn of the Trump campaign defended the decision to use the nominee's private properties and companies, and said the campaign is complying with FEC rules.""It makes perfect sense to me that you're going to use facilities that you know are of a certain quality,"" he said.Mr. McGahn added that Mr. Trump's donations to his campaign, which top $50 million, more than cover the amount that has been paid to his companies.The campaign has paid $5.6 million to Tag Air, an airline Mr. Trump owns, and almost $7 million to the hat-maker Ace Specialties, whose owner, Christl Mahfouz, sits on the board of the charitable foundation named for Mr. Trump's son, Eric.Mr. Trump's Palm Beach, Fla., golf resort, Mar-a-Lago, has been paid $432,000 in facility rental and lodging payments. Campaign cash has also gone to at least five Trump golf resorts, three Trump restaurants and a wine manufacturing company owned by Eric Trump.Mr. Trump's rental payments to Trump Tower -- $881,000 over the course of the election -- came under scrutiny last week after his latest Federal Election Commission report showed the campaign had dramatically ramped up its payments after it began actively fundraising for the campaign.The campaign paid Trump Tower $169,758 in July, up from $35,457 in April, when he was still largely self-funding his campaign. The increased payments, reported by the Huffington Post, came as the campaign hasn't made any major changes to its staff size.A spokesman said the campaign was paying more in rent because it had expanded its office space to cover two floors for an anticipated increase in its staff size.---Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus and Beth Reinhard",11/15/16
Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814839438?accountid=12768,"Hillary Clinton tried to tar Donald Trump as a racist last week by associating him with the ""alt-right."" Yet it is Mr. Trump who has decried the loss of black life to violent crime -- and has promptly been declared biased for doing so. Whether intentionally or not, Mr. Trump has exposed the hypocrisy of the Black Lives Matter movement and its allies.Speaking in West Bend, Wis., on Aug. 16, only days after the recent riots in Milwaukee, Mr. Trump observed that during ""the last 72 hours . . . another nine were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded."" The victims, as in other cities with rising crime, were overwhelmingly black.Bringing safety to inner-city residents should be a top presidential priority, Mr. Trump said: ""Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets and walk to school. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school."" Mr. Trump promised to restore law and order ""for the sake of all, but most especially for the sake of those living in the affected communities.""The reaction was swift. On CNN the activist and former Obama adviser Van Jones called it ""despicable"" and ""shocking in its divisiveness."" Historian Josh Zeitz told USA Today that ""the term law and order in modern American politics is, ipso facto, a racially tinged term.""Mr. Trump's acceptance speech in July at the Republican National Convention provoked similar dismay. ""Young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson,"" he said, have ""the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America.""This defense of black children was too much for Alicia Garza, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement. ""The terrifying vision that Donald J. Trump is putting forward casts him alongside some of the worst fascists in history,"" Ms. Garza said. The executive director of the Advancement Project, Judith Browne Dianis, complained that ""the speech lends itself to be interpreted as isolating and scapegoating of communities of color."" Political commentator Sally Kohn wrote in Time that Mr. Trump ""has basically recycled Richard Nixon's version of dog whistle racism by insisting he is the 'law and order candidate' -- implicitly protecting White America.""Why this frenzied effort to demonize Mr. Trump for addressing the heightened violence in inner cities? Because the Republican nominee has also correctly identified its cause: the false ""narrative of cops as a racist force in our society,"" as he put it in Wisconsin.Ever since the Black Lives Matter movement burst onto the national scene in 2014, following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., violent crime has surged in urban areas. In America's largest 56 cities, homicides rose 17% last year, the largest one-year increase in more than two decades. In Washington, D.C., homicides jumped 54%; in Milwaukee, 73%; in Cleveland, 90%.The reason is a drop-off in the proactive policing that activists and academics denounce as racist. While cops continue to rush to 911 calls in minority neighborhoods, they are making fewer pedestrian stops and engaging in less public-order enforcement. Backing off such activity is presumably what Black Lives Matter supporters, including President Obama, want.Yet the victims of the resulting crime surge are almost exclusively black; whites have largely been unaffected. In Baltimore, 45 people were killed in July 2015, 43 of them black. In Chicago, 2,460 blacks were shot last year, lethally or non-lethally, according to the city's police department. That's nearly seven a day. Seventy-eight white residents were shot in 2015, though the white share of the Chicago population is about the same as the black share. Blacks in Chicago were 18 times more likely to be killed last year than whites, up from eight times more likely in 2005.Police shootings are a minute fraction of this carnage. So far this year in Chicago, they account for about 0.5% of all shootings. Four studies published this year alone have further undercut the claim that we are living through an epidemic of racially biased policing shootings. Harvard economist Roland Fryer, for example, examined data from Dallas, Austin, Houston, Los Angeles and six Florida counties. He found no evidence of racial discrimination in police shootings; officers in Houston were nearly 24% less likely to shoot blacks than whites.When Mr. Trump pledges to restore law and order, he is not promising to ""protect White America,"" in Sally Kohn's words. He is addressing a problem that whites could easily ignore, if they were the bigots that the Black Lives Matter movement and nearly the whole of academia make them out to be.Strangely, it is Mr. Obama and Black Lives Matter sympathizers who have turned their eyes from the rising black victimization. FBI Director James Comey warned last October that the ""chill wind blowing through American law enforcement"" was leading to a ""huge increase"" in urban homicides and shootings. Mr. Obama promptly accused him of ""cherry-picking data"" and having a ""political agenda.""After Mr. Trump drew attention in his convention speech to the rising urban violence, President Obama again dismissed the casualties as merely an ""uptick in murders and violent crime in some cities."" It is hard not to translate this is as: white lives matter; black lives, not so much.Mr. Trump's call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted, thanks to the 20-year decline in crime brought on by the proactive policing revolution of the 1990s. Mr. Trump has issued a much-needed warning that the antipolice narrative is putting black lives in jeopardy and undercutting the foundation of a civilized society. It is a message he should amplify.---Ms. Mac Donald is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the author of ""The War on Cops.""(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Mac Donald Is Right About Rise in Murders of Blacks"" -- WSJ Sept. 7, 2016)Credit: By Heather Mac Donald",11/15/16
Trump's Tax Withholding Is a Signal,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814839427?accountid=12768,"Of all Donald Trump's portrayals of his tax returns, including ""extremely complex,"" ""beautiful"" and ""very big,"" no phrase has ignited more passion or dismay than ""none of your business."" Hillary Clinton has posted to her campaign website full copies of her tax returns since 2007, as well as returns for her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine. Yet Mr. Trump refuses to follow suit.Although Mr. Trump is breaking with precedent -- every Republican presidential nominee since 1980 has released personal tax returns -- he is not breaking the law. The Internal Revenue Code clearly provides that Mr. Trump's ""returns and return information shall be confidential"" unless he consents to disclosure. There's no exception for taxpayers who happen to be running for president.Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) has been trying to change that since May, when he introduced the Presidential Tax Transparency Act. If signed into law, it would require the presidential nominees of major parties to make their three most recent years of tax returns public by filing them with the Federal Election Commission. In a statement announcing the bill, Sen. Wyden argued that ""tax returns deliver honest answers to key questions,"" including whether the candidate pays taxes, donates to charity or keeps money offshore.While tax returns can answer those questions, it would be misguided to mandate their disclosure. As the law stands, candidates must disclose voluntarily, which provides voters with a valuable signal. The same way that wearing a suit to a job interview at a law firm suggests professionalism, a presidential candidate's choosing to post personal tax returns indicates a willingness to be transparent and forthcoming.Since the role of president often involves candidly communicating the government's actions and decisions to the public, many voters see openness as a prerequisite. Consequently, they may not trust or support a candidate who decides to break with tradition and withhold tax returns. They might even speculate that this indicates the candidate isn't serious about wanting the job.If Sen. Wyden's bill became law, and presidential nominees were legally required to publish their tax returns, voters would lose this signal. If every applicant for the law firm position were legally required to wear a business suit to the interview, the partners could no longer easily weed out the people who otherwise would have showed up in a T-shirt.Moreover, candidates' tax returns are less revealing than advocates of mandatory disclosure suggest. A motivated accountant could pass dubious income -- from Russia, say -- through other legal entities such as limited liability companies to prevent its true source from appearing on the candidate's personal tax return.Similar tricks can be played to minimize the appearance of income and wealth. For instance, in the year of disclosure a candidate could overpay the IRS and file a return showing significant tax liability. Then he could request a refund in a future year not subject to disclosure.As the law stands, presidential candidates must choose whether or not to disclose their personal tax returns -- and for good reason. If Donald Trump continues to refuse calls to publicly post his returns, it's up to voters to decide what that says about him.---Mr. Blank is a professor of tax practice and faculty director of the graduate tax program at the New York University School of Law.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Wyden Defends His Tax-Form Disclosure Act"" -- WSJ Sept. 2, 2016)Credit: By Joshua D.

Election 2016: Mixed Signals on Trump Immigrant Plan --- Campaign suggests stance may soften; Democrats and some in GOP see no change,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812834133?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's campaign suggested Sunday that the Republican presidential candidate is prepared to soften his stance on immigration, though the signal was ambiguous.Mr. Trump has made a tough stand on immigration a signature issue of his campaign, pledging among other things to create a ""deportation force"" to rapidly remove some of the country's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.On Sunday, his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, dialed back on that pledge, suggesting the deportation force might not be set up after all. Asked on CNN if Mr. Trump would mobilize this deportation force in the White House, Ms. Conway responded: ""To be determined.""She added: ""What he supports is to ensure that we respect the law. He will lay out the specifics of that plan.""Others in the campaign, though, suggested there would be no backtracking on Mr. Trump's proposals to significantly tighten immigration policies.Mr. Trump tried this past week to reach out to minority groups, in part by holding a meeting on Saturday with his Hispanic Advisory Council at Trump Tower in New York. Mr. Trump has angered many Hispanic leaders during the campaign, due to his comments about Hispanic immigrants being ""rapists"" and his plan to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.The meeting produced a tangle of reports that indicated Mr. Trump told the gathering that he was open to changing his view. A Republican National Committee representative at the Saturday session said Mr. Trump gave no indication he would support legalization for some undocumented residents.A Trump spokesman, Steven Cheung, said the candidate's immigration position hasn't changed. ""Mr. Trump said nothing today that he hasn't said many times before, including in his convention speech -- enforce our immigration laws, uphold the Constitution, and be fair and humane while putting American workers first,"" he said.John Podesta, chairman of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign, said the Trump position doesn't appear to have changed, and added that the GOP nominee's positions add up to a policy that could hurt many families. ""We believe the RNC official in the room, the campaign's statement after the meeting and the candidate himself that Donald Trump's immigration plan remains the same as it's always been: tear apart families,"" Mr. Podesta said.Any retreat on immigration policies, which have been a signature issue for Mr. Trump, could be politically risky.On the one hand, GOP leaders have urged the campaign to soften its rhetoric in an attempt to improve Mr. Trump's poor standing with the growing universe of Hispanic voters, who make up an estimated 12% of eligible voters this year.But Mr. Trump's fervent backers are counting on a continued tough line on immigration. At his rallies, they frequently break into chants of ""build the wall"" to underscore his promise to build a wall to keep immigrants from Mexico and Central America out. They may grant Mr. Trump some leeway, given his longstanding stance as a fighter against illegal immigration, but also could be upset with any move to cater to other voters by softening the message.Sen. Jeff Sessions, a key Trump adviser, was asked on Sunday whether the candidate still planned to quickly deport the 11 million people if he won the White House.The Alabama Republican, speaking on CBS, was noncommittal. ""What I'm certain about is that he did not make a firm commitment yesterday, or the meeting the other day, about what he will do with that,"" the senator said. ""But he did listen, and he's talking about it.""Mr. Sessions emphasized Mr. Trump isn't backing off his plan for ""extreme vetting,"" or ideological assessments, for those coming into the U.S.""The American people clearly support the idea that if you can't vet somebody from a dangerous area of the globe, they should not be brought into the U.S.,"" he said.Credit: By Jay Solomon",11/15/16
Silicon Valley Gives Trump Cold Shoulder,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812831693?accountid=12768,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Republicans have been trying to strengthen their ties to Silicon Valley, in part to boost support from its wealthy executives. Donald Trump, the party's presidential nominee, hasn't followed suit.While other GOP presidential candidates earlier this election cycle held meetings and fundraisers in the region, Mr. Trump has done little to form relationships here. Though the executives largely lean Democratic, they include libertarians and others open to the party's antiregulatory message.Now, many of the industry's Republicans say they are devoting their efforts and money to congressional races or, in some cases, to boosting Democrat Hillary Clinton.Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, has become the most prominent Silicon Valley figure to support Mr. Trump. He spoke at the Republican convention last month in prime time, just before Mr. Trump formally accepted his party's nomination.Yet Mr. Thiel, who donated $2 million to a super PAC backing one of Mr. Trump's former presidential primary rivals, ex-Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, has no plans to donate to or raise money for Mr. Trump, a spokesman said.The frosty relations mean Mr. Trump's fundraising operation potentially is leaving millions of dollars on the table, adding to his already-substantial shortfall with Mrs. Clinton. She ended July with $140 million in her campaign, joint funds with the Democratic Party and a friendly super PAC; Mr. Trump's comparable take was $78 million.Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle Corp., spent $5 million backing Sen. Marco Rubio in his GOP presidential run and in 2012 gave $3 million to a super PAC supporting Republican nominee Mitt Romney. But he has yet to open his wallet for Mr. Trump, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A spokesman for Mr. Ellison didn't return a request for comment.Mr. Trump's challenges are reflected in FEC filings and interviews with more than a dozen prominent Republican donors in Silicon Valley. Tech executives say their dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump goes beyond his lack of outreach. His calls for tougher limits on trade and immigration conflict with the industry's interests, they say, and his controversial comments about various ethnic and racial groups are culturally out of step with Silicon Valley.Moreover, Mr. Trump rarely talks about high tech's role in the economy, focusing instead on efforts to aid small business, manufacturing and the coal industry.Mr. Trump's campaign declined a request for comment.Silicon Valley donors say the Trumpcampaign hasn't reached out to discuss policy or fundraising. He hasn't released atechpolicy platform, as Mrs. Clinton did in June. His campaign opened an office near the region just a few weeks before the California primary in June.Mr. Trump has also attacked several toptechcompanies or their CEOs. He fired shots at Apple Inc., for example, for what he called its noncooperation with a Justice Department terrorism investigation.""For Silicon Valley Republicans, this is just an extremely unattractive candidate,"" said Alex Slusky, founder of venture-capital firm Vector Capital, who donated $100,000 to a super PAC backing Mr. Rubio in February. Mr. Slusky said that in conversations with fellow Republicans in the industry, he refers to the 2016 campaign as ""the worst election in our adult lifetimes.""In the current election cycle through June, GOP presidential candidates, including those who exited the race, and allied super PACs collectively raised nearly $18 million from the communications and electronics sector, which includes thetechindustry, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.Mr. Trump's share: $336,000. Mrs. Clinton's haul from the industry in the same period: $30 million.Some tech executives have been vocal critics of Mr. Trump. Nearly 150 published an open letter calling the nominee a ""disaster for innovation."" Several tech companies reduced or eliminated donations to the Republican convention.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. Chief Executive Meg Whitman, a billionaire Republican, earlier this month said she planned to back Mrs. Clinton and donate to her campaign.Planned fundraisers for Mr. Trump have also taken a hit. At least two co-hosts of an event in Seattle later this month -- including Mr. Trump's Oregon state finance chairman -- said they didn't plan to attend the gathering, citing the nominee's policy positions and his attacks on the parents of an American Muslim soldier killed in Iraq.In June, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich planned an event for Mr. Trump at his Atherton, Calif., home, but canceled it after the plans were reported by the New York Times. Mr. Krzanich, at an event last month, said the gathering was planned not as a fundraiser but as an opportunity to discuss issues important to the tech industry.The media scrutiny of Mr. Krzanich's event ""sent a chill down a number of spines"" of other tech Republicans who may have considered a similar event, said Trevor Traina, founder of e-commerce company IfOnly. Mr. Traina, who gave $50,000 to a pro-Bush super PAC last year, said the response was akin to a ""witch hunt.""Mr. Trump has raised substantial funds online, bringing in $64 million in July alone for his campaign and a joint Republican Party fund via digital and email efforts. But he has struggled to make inroads in big fundraising centers.Many top Wall Street donors, including hedge-fund billionaire Paul Singer, haven't rallied behind the GOP nominee, and the industry was rankled by the Republican platform's embrace of a law that would force the breakup of large financial institutions.Lawyers and lobbyists, a top source of Mr. Romney's 2012 contributions, also have kept their distance. Not a single registered lobbyist had raised funds for Mr. Trump through June, according to FEC disclosures.""You cannot speak so much against immigration that you turn the best and the brightest from coming to the U.S., because that will hurt us,"" said Robert Nelsen, a venture capitalist who gave $2,500 to a super PAC backing Mr. Rubio.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Rebecca Ballhaus",11/15/16
The College Republicans Divide Over Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812831512?accountid=12768,"This past spring, ""Feel the Bern"" laptop stickers and T-shirts proliferated at colleges across the nation as Bernie Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Students heading back to campus for the new school year, however, are not likely to see many ""Make America Great Again"" caps -- even among self-avowed Republicans.At left-of-center universities College Republicans have always been working in occupied territory. But this year they have splintered over Donald Trump. Their responses, which range from enthusiastic to antipathetic, mirror divisions in the national GOP.The Harvard Republican Club will not be supporting this year's nominee. ""Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic,"" the club announced in an Aug. 4 statement. President Declan Garvey says that in a recent survey of club members only 10% backed the party's nominee.At Hillsdale College, Republicans do not traditionally endorse candidates. This year is no different, says president Brant Cohen. ""We desire our members to think and choose for themselves using the foundation of a conservative worldview.""The Princeton Republicans are new to the Hillsdale approach. On Aug. 8 the club declined to take a position on Mr. Trump's candidacy. In a sign of the times, its statement says ""we encourage people to vote for candidates who have demonstrated a commitment to Republican policies.""Like their Princeton counterparts, Ohio University Republicans plan to focus on down-ballot races this year. The club's president, David Parkhill, calls himself ""very pro-Trump,"" but adds, ""there are members that aren't on the 'Trump Train' yet, so it makes things a little tricky."" The cover photo on the club's Facebook page promotes the re-election of incumbent Sen. Rob Portman.The College Republican National Committee takes a forgiving tone. Chairman Alexandra Smith says ""there is more than one way to be a College Republican."" She further notes the ""nearly universal"" opposition to Hillary Clinton among College Republican chapters, as well as their strong support for down-ballot Republicans.Still, not every campus chapter is reticent about the GOP nominee. The 600-member Citadel Republican Society ""enthusiastically supports Donald Trump,"" according to president Zac Rutherford. Ditto for Liberty University, where chairman Jonah Athey says his College Republicans are ""proud to stand behind Donald Trump."" The University of Alabama College Republicans president Drew Mansell agreed, noting, ""the choice in this election could not be more clear.""Perhaps the most comprehensive endorsement of Mr. Trump comes from the Notre Dame College Republicans, which took the form of a 900-word statement assessing the New Yorker's policies. ""We can and must support our party's nominee,"" the Fighting Irish Republicans concluded. ""While his personality may be brash, it is important to remember that we are not electing a neighbor or a friend.""At Yale, my own university, the College Republicans affirmed their support for Mr. Trump earlier this month. ""Our party, of which we are an official branch and to which we remain loyal,"" read the statement, ""has nominated Donald Trump for president.""Well, not everyone was loyal. In response to this endorsement, several club leaders immediately resigned to establish the ""Yale New Republicans"" -- who pledge to ""put national interests above partisan ones.""So what does it matter whether or not College Republicans endorse Mr. Trump? Millennial.gop -- a project of the College Republican National Committee -- notes the high price of ignoring young voters.""If young voters had voted like other age groups,"" it points out, ""Mitt Romney would have won the popular vote and the electoral college, with significant gains for Republicans down ballot."" As the schism among College Republican chapters underscores, Mr. Trump is having a hard time even among young people who are already Republican. What does that say about his prospects for the larger youth vote come November?---Mr. Young, a Robert L.

What Trump's Foreign Policy Gets Right,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812831399?accountid=12768,"Had one of Donald Trump's Republican opponents during the campaign for the GOP nomination given the same speech on combating global terrorism he gave last week, it would have raised few eyebrows. Naturally, competing candidates would have disputed particular points -- some vigorously -- but the speech's overall analysis fits well within mainstream conservative and Republican thinking.Some Trump opponents and supporters alike will be distressed by this news, but the speech visibly sharpens the contradictions with Hillary Clinton, who clearly would continue President Obama's nonstrategy concerning radical Islam -- now confirmed to include paying ransom for hostages. More broadly, the speech underlines why terrorism and other grave national-security threats should take center stage in the presidential race.Mr. Trump rightly sees an ideological war being waged against the West by a hateful, millenarian obsession targeting core American constitutional and philosophical principles. From that assessment flow several policy consequences, most important the imperative to destroy the terrorist threat rapidly and comprehensively before it kills and maims more innocent people. Mr. Trump correctly argues that, in combating Islamic State, al Qaeda and others, ""we must use ideological warfare"" as well as stronger military and intelligence operations, and be ""a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers."" This strategy is entirely consistent with what Jordan's King Abdullah II and other Arab leaders characterize as a civil war within Islam.In contrast, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton still believe terrorism is a law-enforcement issue. They fail to grasp the ideological war we are in and therefore refuse to combat the enemy effectively. There were once those who did not see Communism as an ideological threat. They played down their views publicly because U.S. public opinion was overwhelmingly contrary, as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are doing now regarding terrorism. Mr. Trump should emphatically move the debate about radical Islam into the campaign spotlight. Let's see who stands where.Mr. Trump's speech also demonstrated his willingness to face the hand dealt an incoming president, rather than following ideological abstractions, as Mr. Obama has consistently done. Although Mr. Trump restated his opposition to President George W. Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq and overthrow of the dictator Saddam Hussein, he nonetheless argues correctly that Mr. Obama's ""reckless"" withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011 rested on an ""election-driven timetable"" that ""surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS,"" thereby constituting ""a catastrophic mistake.""The wider implications of Mr. Trump's speech were apparent in the subsequent commentary on two points: The GOP nominee's immigration views as they intersect with terrorism, and his disdain for ""nation building."" Let us take them in turn.Mr. Trump correctly identified the terrorist threat as fundamentally ideological. It would be inexcusable for America not to combat that ideology in multiple ways, both offensively and defensively. Countering Islamic State's successful propaganda and recruitment efforts, especially digitally, and exposing them for the barbarians their conduct proves them to be are critical elements of a winning plan.Confronted with ideological threats, America is entirely justified in raising appropriate immigration protections, which is neither unprecedented nor contrary to existing law. Even now, a central statutory requirement for U.S. naturalization is that applicants be ""of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution . . . and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States."" That sounds very much like Mr. Trump's speech, and hardly earth-shaking. Whether existing authorities suffice or whether new legislation is needed is unclear, but the broad policy isn't.On nation building, the debate is confused, with many advocates mistakenly conflating it with ""intervention."" The two are different. President George H.W. Bush's November 1992 decision to intervene militarily in anarchic Somalia, and his successor Bill Clinton's far-different policies, highlight the distinction.Agree or disagree with President Bush's Somalia intervention, he precisely defined his limited objective of opening channels for humanitarian supplies. Although the military operations were blessed by the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Bush was always clear that they would be under U.S. command. So fixed was Mr. Bush on the intervention's limits, he showed remarkable deference to President-elect Clinton by offering to withdraw all American forces by Jan. 20, 1993.But Mr. Clinton had much grander objectives, namely practicing ""assertive multilateralism."" Somalia was his chosen vehicle for nation building. Mr. Clinton's ambassador to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, praised Security Council action endorsing the president's nation-building project, saying, ""With this resolution, we will embark on an unprecedented enterprise aimed at nothing less than the restoration of an entire country as a proud, functioning and viable member of the community of nations.""Disaster soon followed. And subsequent American nation-building efforts in other countries fared little better. Although bilateral financial, technical and military assistance can advance U.S. foreign-policy objectives, the local peoples themselves must know what they are about. We can't do it for them and shouldn't pretend otherwise.This foreign-policy reality has been clear since the Marshall Plan. Following World War II, Washington provided assistance in various forms but insisted that European states conduct nation rebuilding, relying on existing legal, political and cultural foundations far stronger than those prevalent in less-developed regions. Mr. Trump isn't committing heresy by saying America's recent attempts at nation-building haven't ended well. He's telling the truth.More important, whether Mr. Trump is ""interventionist"" or ""noninterventionist"" in his proclivities is really a nonissue, as are academic flights of fancy such as characterizing U.S. ""multilateralism"" positively and ""unilateralism"" negatively. These are essentially word games about tools rather than policies, like asking in the abstract ""do you favor using a knife or a spoon?"" Obviously, the critical question for real policy makers is ""to do what?""National security should be central to the 2016 presidential contest. Mr. Trump's speech is a serious contribution to that end. He needs to maintain his focus and discipline, and by so doing compel Mrs. Clinton to defend her intention to continue President Obama's failed polices.---Mr. Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of ""Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad"" (Simon & Schuster, 2007).Credit: By John Bolton",11/15/16
A Trump Deportation Reversal?,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1812831186?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump on policy is something less than a North Star, but that has its advantages if he jettisons one of his least attractive positions. Could the Republican be reconsidering his promise to deport the 11 million or more illegal immigrants estimated to be living and working in the U.S.?That's the intriguing possibility coming from the Trump campaign on the weekend. Mr. Trump met Saturday with his new Hispanic advisory council and attendees told the press the candidate seemed to be moving in that direction. Univision reports that three attendees said Mr. Trump ""plans to present an immigration plan in Colorado Thursday that will include finding a way to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants.""Trump advisers Kellyanne Conway and Sen. Jeff Sessions didn't deny the reports on Sunday.

""But he did listen, and he's talking about it.""Go for it, Mr. Trump. The Clinton campaign will cry ""flip-flop,"" but most voters would welcome the change as a sign of political progress and tolerance. A policy of mass deportation could never happen without the kind of human and economic disruption the American people won't support once they see what it requires. House-to-house searches and forced family separation would cause a political uproar that would stop such a policy cold, as it should. The abrupt removal of millions from the workforce would probably cause a recession.It's possible to improve U.S. immigration controls without such a draconian policy that millions of Republican primary voters didn't favor.

An Election 2016 article Thursday about the impact of Donald Trump's campaign on down-ballot contests omitted mention of the primary race and said Mr. Martins is challenging Tom Suozzi, the former Democratic Nassau County executive, in the general election.(WSJ Sept. 7, 2016)MINNETONKA, Minn. -- In November, Republicans could lose a House seat in the western suburbs of Minneapolis, while Democrats risk seeing a seat slip away on Long Island's north shore. The likely reason in both cases: Donald Trump.Sizing up the impact of the GOP presidential nominee's unorthodox candidacy on down-ballot races has become a preoccupation of strategists on both sides of the aisle.The main worry on the GOP side is how Mr. Trump will affect competitive Senate races, statewide contests often swayed by oversized turnout in a presidential year. Republicans are defending 11 seats in states President Barack Obama has won. Democrats need to pick up only five to win back a majority -- four if Hillary Clinton beats Mr. Trump.While Republicans are expected to hold their majority in the House, measuring the Trump effect in those races is a more elusive task because few are truly swing districts. Most were drawn by state legislatures to favor one party or another, meaning some Republican districts could be jammed with GOP voters drawn to Mr. Trump -- or repelled by him.""Trump is tanking in some districts and holding his own in others,"" said Dave Wasserman, the Cook Political Report's House editor. ""That's why Democrats are struggling to turn this into a down-ballot rout.""Democrats need to pick up 30 House seats to win back the majority, and the district outside Minneapolis is one of their top targets. It is more affluent, higher-educated and more female than the average district -- all constituencies that tend to be disenchanted by the Republican nominee.Terri Bonoff, a centrist Democratic Minnesota state senator, is challenging incumbent Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen, whose district Mr. Obama won in 2008 and 2012.In Minnesota's March GOP primary, Mr. Trump won just 18% support, a distant third behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.""I'm running because I'm saying no to Donald Trump,"" said Ms. Bonoff. ""That's black and white to me.""Ms. Bonoff matches her opponent on most fiscal questions but leans to the left on key social issues such as gun control, about which voters across the district raised repeated concerns in interviews.Lexi Tripps, a substitute teacher in Hopkins, Minn., jumped off a picnic blanket to greet Ms. Bonoff at a ""Salsa in the Park"" event. Ms. Tripps, a former Republican and Paulsen supporter, was so put off by Mr. Trump's comments about women she said she is going to vote for Democrats down the ticket this year. ""We're just Terri Bonoff people now,"" she said, gesturing at a group of women sharing her blanket.Mr. Paulsen has tried to keep a distance from Mr. Trump. He said the nominee hadn't yet ""earned"" his vote, backtracking from more supportive statements in the spring.""No matter what he says [about Mr. Trump], he's getting hammered,"" said Denny Schulstad, a former Republican strategist and member of the Minneapolis City Council. ""And he could lose because of that.""Mr. Trump's candidacy is cutting the opposite way in some Maine, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York districts with large white, working-class constituencies.In Long Island's Third District, Rep. Steve Israel, the former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman, is retiring, and the party is fighting to hold his seat. Jack Martins, a GOP state senator representing parts of Nassau, Suffolk and Queens counties, is challenging Tom Suozzi, the former Democratic Nassau County executive.Mr. Trump, a Queens native, won the district in the state's April primary with 67% of the vote.In Queens, his support reached 72%.""There's a strong enthusiasm for Donald Trump; we really like him here,"" said Phil Orenstein, president of Queens Village Republican Club.Voters in the district are older, wealthier and less female than in the Minnesota suburb. Joseph Lisa, a retired state judge and member of the New York State Assembly, said he has never voted for a Republican. Now, he is considering it. ""The Democratic Party sometimes takes senior Democrats like myself and makes us feel unwelcome,"" he said.Credit: By Michelle Hackman",11/17/16
Trump Vows Deportations --- GOP nominee doubles down after Mexican leader says his country won't pay for border wall,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815605861?accountid=12768,"PHOENIX -- Hours after seeming to ease his immigration and trade policy while standing with Mexico's president, Donald Trump reiterated the tough stance that powered his Republican presidential campaign.He told a crowd of raucous supporters Wednesday evening that all illegal immigrants are ""subject to deportation"" and all those seeking legalization would have to go home and re-enter the country legally.Mr. Trump also doubled down on his assertion that Mexico will pay to build an ""impenetrable"" wall on the Southern border. ""They don't know it yet, and they're going to pay for it,"" he said at a rally here just hours after his meeting in Mexico City with President Enrique Pena Nieto, who told Mr. Trump that his nation had no intentions of underwriting such a project.In amplifying the harsh tone of his immigration policy, Mr. Trump was placing a clear bet that, on this signature issue of his campaign, it is more important to err on the side of revving up his supporters than to soften his tone to reach out to unpersuaded voters.""We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Our message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the U.S. by illegally entering our country.""The surprise visit to Mexico City Wednesday and Phoenix address came as Mr. Trump trails Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in polling in each of the 11 battleground states that will decide the general election.His weakness among Hispanic voters has damaged his standing in Colorado, Nevada and Florida, and made Arizona competitive -- a heavily Republican state where the Clinton campaign opened two offices in August and invested more than $100,000 in field staffers to register voters and boost Democratic turnout.David Axelrod, the senior strategist for President Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, predicted Mr. Trump would reap some political benefit merely by standing next to a world leader. But Mrs. Clinton disagreed, saying on Twitter, ""Trump just failed his first foreign test. Diplomacy isn't as easy as it looks.""For the last 10 days Mr. Trump has articulated varied proposals on how he would deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country. On Wednesday, he punted on that politically-vexing issue.Instead, Mr. Trump said he would jettison protections President Barack Obama has sought for parents of legal U.S. citizens and, on his first day in office, deport 2 million illegal immigrants he said have criminal records. He also said he would, without due process, remove any undocumented person who is arrested for any crime.""We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,"" he said.Deportations wouldn't be limited to people suspected or convicted of crimes. ""Anyone who enters the United States illegally is subject to deportation,"" he said.For new immigrants, Mr. Trump said he would install ""new screening tests"" that he said would ""include an ideological certification."" He also said he would complete a ""biometric entry-exit visa tracking system.""Mr. Trump also reiterated immigration proposals he has touted on the campaign trail. He would rescind Mr. Obama's executive actions to defer deportations for some illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and some illegal immigrant parents whose children are American citizens.In addition to building the wall he said he would add 5,000 border patrol officers.Earlier, Mr. Trump's campaign had signaled a softening of his rhetoric on issues of trade and immigration, and a more subdued Mr. Trump appeared to do that during a joint appearance with Mr. Enrique Pena Nieto.On the issue of trade, the Republican presidential nominee did appear to give some room, telling reporters in Mexico City that he would aim to ""improve"" the North American Free Trade Agreement, an accord he has long called ""a disaster."" In a joint briefing after the meeting, he also said he would aim to keep manufacturing ""in our hemisphere,"" referring to North America.Yet, during his evening rally, Mr. Trump repeated his pledges to punish American companies that move to Mexico and enact steep new tariffs on imports.Earlier in the day in Mexico City, Mr. Trump said at the briefing that ""we didn't discuss payment of the wall,"" but called the barrier ""a shared objective.""Mr. Pena Nieto, however, said he told Mr. Trump in private that Mexico wouldn't subsidize a border barrier. ""At the beginning of my conversation with Donald Trump I made clear that Mexico would not pay for the wall,"" he wrote on Twitter later Wednesday.Mr. Pena Nieto's spokesman, Eduardo Sanchez, said Mr. Trump didn't respond to the president's statement, so there was no discussion. Trump spokesman Jason Miller released a statement that didn't mention the wall payment dispute but said ""it is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue."" Mr. Miller didn't respond to requests for clarification.Mr. Pena Nieto condemned several of Mr. Trump's campaign proposals and his characterization of some illegal immigrants as drug dealers and rapists. ""Mexicans felt offended by what was said"" during the campaign, Mr. Pena Nieto said.The Mexican president noted illegal immigration was at a 10-year low, and said economic activity in the two nations benefit each other. He called the Nafta trade pact a boon to the U.S. economy, but said he would be willing to ""modernize"" it.Messrs. Trump and Pena Nieto described their meeting as polite but blunt. Mr. Trump said it was ""a great honor"" to be invited to Los Pinos, the official residence of the Mexican president, while Mr. Pena Nieto said Mr. Trump demonstrated his willingness to work with Mexico by visiting the country.Mr. Trump, reading from notes, said he told Mr. Pena Nieto that Nafta has benefited Mexico far more than it has the U.S. Mr. Pena Nieto said his priority is ""to protect Mexicans, wherever they are.""The visit was harshly criticized in Mexico as capitulation to a U.S. candidate who had attacked the country repeatedly on the campaign trail. The meeting was unlikely to help Mr. Pena Nieto improve his approval ratings, which are the lowest of any Mexican leader in two decades, analysts said.""Pena Nieto had a golden opportunity to speak truth to power and instead he showed weakness, handing the stage to Trump to reaffirm in our faces that yes, there will be a wall,"" said Sergio Aguayo, an academic at the Colegio de Mexico graduate school in Mexico City.Mr. Trump's revised approach to Nafta differs from the trade policy he has articulated since launching his campaign. During a ""60 Minutes"" interview last September, he called Nafta ""a disaster"" that ""shouldn't exist.""Though he said Wednesday that Nafta has benefited Mexico more than it has the U.S., he didn't repeat calls to install tariffs of up to 40% on U.S. companies that relocate to Mexico.---Santiago Perez and Hanaa Tameez contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

Election 2016: Trump's Immigration Shift Echoes Obama --- Nominee's call to focus on expelling criminals moves him closer to administration's policy,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815275745?accountid=12768,"For more than a year, Donald Trump has cast President Barack Obama as too lax on illegal immigration. But the Republican presidential nominee's recent shift from calling for a deportation force to expel all illegal immigrants to focusing on criminals aligns his policy more closely with the current administration's priorities.Mr. Obama increasingly has focused on deporting felons, gang members, suspected terrorists andrecent illegalborder-crossers, while seeking to defer deportations of millions of illegal immigrants with children who are U.S. citizens.Overall, the administration has deported a record number of illegal immigrants when those apprehended at or near the border are included in the tally, though the yearly number has been declining.""We prioritize criminals,"" Mr. Obama said in June after the Supreme Court blocked his plan to shield parents from deportation and give them work permits. ""What we don't do is to prioritize people who've been here a long time, who are otherwise law-abiding, who have roots and connections in their communities.""Mr. Trump is under pressure to offer more details about his policies in a speech on immigration Wednesday in Phoenix, after more than a week of conflicting explanations of where he stands on deportations, from both the GOP nominee and his advisers.""Everybody agrees we get the bad ones out,"" Mr. Trump said at a town hall hosted by Fox News last week, where he also suggested he would ""work with"" longtime residents with jobs and children.""We are going to get rid of the criminals, and it's going to happen within one hour after I take office, we start to bring them back where they came from,"" he said Saturday while campaigning in Iowa.During the primary, Mr. Trump said anyone who came to the U.S.illegally must leave. ""You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely,""Mr. Trump told MSNBC in November.The shift in Mr. Trump's approach comes as he trails Mrs. Clinton in polling in every one of the 11 expected battleground states, though her lead in some national polls is narrowing.A tough immigration stance has been his campaign's trademark since his announcement speech in June last year, when he said Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers over the border, and attacked rivals who backed proposals to provide citizenship or legal status to illegal immigrants.""If Trump does end up proposing that enforcement should focus on those who pose a real threat to our security or community safety, it would be highly ironic, because those were the positions he rabidly attacked when proposed by Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, let alone the attacks he's made on the Obama administration's approach,"" said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group.About 2.7 million illegal immigrants have been expelled, from shortly before Mr. Obama took office through this month, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement statistics. More than half of those had criminal records.Ms. Murguia called Mr. Obama the ""deporter in chief"" in 2014, though she has since praised the administration for prosecutorial discretion that has scaled back deportations.In the year ending in September 2015, 86% of the 235,413 deportations covered people dubbed ""priority one"" by the Department of Homeland Security: terrorism suspects, gang members, felons and illegal border crossers.Proponents of stricter immigration laws say the administration ignores too many illegal immigrants by targeting only the most violent criminals. Deportations under Mr. Obama have fallen since a peak in 2012.That gives Mr. Trump room to step up enforcement, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports reduced immigration.""The Obama administration has said publicly it is focusing on criminal aliens, but what that has meant in practice is only going after the worst of the worst,"" she said. ""It appears that Trump would go after all of the worst.""At his rallies, Mr. Trump has featured parents of children killed by illegal immigrants, and he invited several to speak at the GOP convention.Among them is Mary Ann Mendoza, whose son was killed in a 2014 car crash by an illegal immigrant driving the wrong way on an Arizona highway.""Trump is softening the delivery, but he's not softening his stance,"" she said. ""We've got a president who is allowing illegals to run amok in this country, and Trump is going to follow the law.""Credit: By Beth Reinhard and Reid J. Epstein",11/17/16
Trump's Immigration Shift Is a Winner,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815275359?accountid=12768,"It's anyone's guess where Donald Trump really stands these days on illegal immigration. Even Donald Trump may not know for certain, which is why the Republican presidential nominee apparently feels compelled to clarify his stance in a speech scheduled for Wednesday.Given the centrality of immigration to Mr. Trump's presidential run, this ambiguity is noteworthy. No one puzzled over where Ronald Reagan stood on tax cuts or defense spending 10 weeks before Election Day in 1980. Barack Obama's health-care ambitions were unwavering and clear to all in August 2008. If you knew nothing else about Mr. Trump's candidacy this year, it was that he vowed to wall off the southern border and remove every cotton-pickin' foreign national here illegally. Until the past week or so, that is.To be accurate, skepticism about Mr. Trump's sincerity on deportation isn't new. In February, BuzzFeed reported that the candidate had told the New York Times in an off-the-record interview that his views on expelling illegal immigrants were more flexible than he had let on. Asked about the story, Mr. Trump allowed that ""everything's negotiable"" but declined the Times's offer to consider releasing the interview transcript.Since then, Mr. Trump's immigration shift has became more overt. In November he was proposing a ""deportation force"" to hunt down the undocumented. Last week, however, he said that giving millions of people the boot is impractical and that enforcement should focus on ""the bad ones"" -- which is the Obama administration's policy. For those who obey the law and contribute to society, Mr. Trump says that no citizenship should be offered and opposes ""amnesty as such."" But if they ""pay back taxes"" he would be willing to ""work with them."" Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio ought to sue for plagiarism.The weekend brought more confusion. Mr. Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, told CNN that ""there'll be no path to legalization, no path to citizenship unless people leave the country."" But when Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was asked by Fox News whether her candidate still supported mass deportation, she answered that his approach was ""softening.""Mr. Trump's supporters who feel betrayed by this evolution instead should take heart. Your candidate hasn't gone wobbly. He's gotten wise. Immigration restrictionism is a surefire political loser for the GOP in national elections, and Mr. Trump has finally figured that out. His signature issue propelled him through a crowded primary where pluralities won the day. But most Republicans who vote in the general election don't take their cues on immigration policy from the talk-radio right. And Mr. Trump's nasty tone has already cost him support not only among minorities but also among whites.American views on immigration, including how to handle the large illegal population, are far more moderate than GOP restrictionists like to admit. When President Obama signed an executive action in 2014 that protected millions from deportation, he did so secure in the knowledge that most voters, including most Republican voters, supported his goal of granting legal status to undocumented aliens. The president's unilateral approach was unpopular, and the courts have found it legally dubious. But in a Pew Research Center survey taken after the immigration order was issued, 70% of all respondents and 53% of Republicans said illegal immigrants who meet certain requirements ""should have a way to stay in the country legally.""Fox News surveys have revealed even stronger GOP support for some form of conditional amnesty. When pollsters asked if the U.S. should ""allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country and eventually qualify for U.S. citizenship, but only if they meet certain requirements like paying back taxes, learning English, and passing a background check,"" 68% of all respondents and 60% of Republican respondents said yes.Mr. Trump has rejected the big-tent strategy that helped George W. Bush win two presidential terms. He is counting on overwhelming white support instead. But white voters are a declining share of the electorate, and young Republicans aren't immigration hard-liners. A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in March found that 52% of Republicans overall and 63% of Republicans under 30 supported creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Sixty-five percent of white Americans with a college degree agreed, as did 54% of whites with a high-school education or less. The older white voters who cheered Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant sentiments don't even represent most of the GOP on immigration, let alone most of the country.How immigrants affect America's economy, culture and homeland security are debates that date to the nation's founding and aren't in any danger of going away. If we're lucky, however, Mr. Trump's candidacy will move us closer to settling the debate over whether anti-immigration is a winning issue for today's GOP.---Mr. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Journal contributor, is the author of ""Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed"" (Encounter Books, 2014).Credit: By Jason L.

Gold Bugs See a Kindred Spirit in Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1815275263?accountid=12768,"A Donald Trump presidency could be a win for gold.The Republican nominee has Wall Street speculating on another surge in gold prices, as the prospect of a Trump presidency adds uncertainty to a shaky global economic picture. Investors typically seek the metal in times of turmoil. But Mr. Trump has gained favor with some gold bugs for another reason: He appears to understand their cause.Gold has long adorned Mr. Trump's personal possessions and his commercial properties. Signs in front of his buildings are colored gold. So are ""membership cards"" for campaign donors. He even occasionally writes notes with golden Sharpies. But as the presidential election draws closer, Mr. Trump also has attracted attention for his affinity for gold as a financial asset.In his campaign's financial disclosure, Mr. Trump said he had an investment in gold of as much as $250,000. The real-estate magnate once accepted a security deposit on one of his properties in the form of three 32-ounce gold bars in 2011.""Sadly, we all know what's happening to the dollar. The dollar is going down, and it's not a pretty picture and it's not being sustained by proper policy and proper thinking,"" Mr. Trump told online publication the Street.com at the time.Since the start of 2011, the WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of 16 currencies, has risen 24%. Gold has fallen 7.7% in that time. This year, gold has risen 24% and the WSJ Dollar Index has declined 3.5%, as investors have rushed to haven assets on global economic worries and the Federal Reserve has held off on raising interest rates.Mr. Trump's comments have resonated with fans of gold, who argue that bullion is one of the world's best and oldest forms of money.""He sort of has this general instinctual notion that gold has been the fundamental money of humanity for literally 5,000 years,"" said Nathan Lewis, author of ""Gold: The Monetary Polaris,"" who said he would likely vote for Mr. Trump. ""I think that will be good going forward.""Along with his comments about the dollar, Mr. Trump also has mused about reinstating a gold-backed currency. ""Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but, boy, would it be wonderful. We'd have a standard on which to base our money,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview with the Scene, an online-video platform. Democrats haven't supported a return to the gold standard.Mr. Trump isn't the first or the most vocal candidate that has expressed support for the gold standard. Other advocates who have run for the presidency include libertarian Ron Paul and media mogul Steve Forbes. Former Republican candidate Sen. Ted Cruz also spoke in favor of the gold standard during his run.The Republican Party's 2016 platform nods to a gold standard in veiled terms, calling for a commission to ""investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar"" and evaluate the need for a ""metallic basis.""Christopher Ecclestone, a mining strategist with research firm Hallgarten & Co., said presidential candidates have occasionally spoken in favor of the gold standard throughout history, though not as a major tenet of a campaign platform.Mr. Trump's comments have appealed to voters looking for someone to help push the effort forward. The lack of specifics in his economic policy may also have helped some supporters to project a gold-bug status on Mr. Trump, Mr. Ecclestone said.""They've been desperate to latch onto presidential candidates that support the gold cause,"" he said. ""I would guess that he's the man to fit their mold.""Should Mr. Trump win the presidency, many gold enthusiasts have doubts about his ability to immediately drive change in monetary policy.Vlad Signorelli, president of Bretton Woods Research, said that while Mr. Trump would have a full plate at the beginning of his presidency, he hopes that he would be able to make policy changes that would boost gold and re-examine how the dollar is valued.""The most important thing from our perspective that Trump can bring to the table is, what does it mean for the U.S. dollar, what does it mean for Fed policy?"" Mr. Signorelli said.Enlarge this image.Credit: By Stephanie Yang",11/17/16
Election 2016: White House Economists Cool to Trump,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814098374?accountid=12768,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has broken with many of the GOP's traditional positions on economic policy, garners no support from any of the White House economists who have advised U.S. presidents for the past half-century.The Wall Street Journal this month reached out to all 45 surviving former members of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under the past eight presidents, going back to Richard Nixon, to get their views on this year's presidential election.Among 17 Republican appointees who responded to Journal inquiries, none said they supported Mr. Trump. Six said they didn't support Mr. Trump and 11 declined to say either way. An additional six didn't respond to repeated messages. Among the 20 Democrats who responded to the Journal, 13 said they supported Mrs. Clinton, none said they opposed her and seven declined to say either way. Two Democratic appointees didn't respond to messages.Mr. Trump ""has a pretty darn good roster of economists who support his policies"" outside the ranks of former council members, said Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and economic analyst who serves as an informal adviser to the New York businessman's campaign.Mr. Trump has said he wants a ""major tax cut"" and he has expressed hostility to free-trade agreements, promising a sharp shift in U.S. trade policy that the campaign says would revive U.S. manufacturing.Some economists expressed unease about anti-free-trade policies espoused by both candidates. ""On the trade issue alone, I wouldn't support either one,"" said Cato Institute adjunct scholar Jerry Jordan, a Ronald Reagan council appointee and former president of the Cleveland Fed.The three-member council, which was established after World War II, advises the president on economic policy. Service on the council can be a stepping stone to senior policy-making positions. Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen all chaired the council and later led the Federal Reserve.""I have known personally every Republican president since Richard Nixon,"" said Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein, who chaired the council under Mr. Reagan. ""They all showed a real understanding of economics and international affairs. . . . Donald Trump does not have that understanding and does not seem to be concerned about it. That alone disqualifies him in my judgment.""Most Democratic economists were vocal in support for Mrs. Clinton. ""I believe she is the most qualified candidate in terms of temperament, intelligence, leadership and policy prescriptions,"" said University of California, Berkeley, economist Christina Romer, who chaired the council under President Barack Obama.Business economists, too, are cool on Mr. Trump. Members of the National Association for Business Economics, in a survey released this week, were asked which candidate would do the best job managing the economy. Some 55% selected Mrs. Clinton versus 14% who picked Mr. Trump.To win support from Richard Schmalensee, dean emeritus at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a council member under President George H.W. Bush, Mr. Trump ""would have to change both many of his positions and his character,"" he said.Mr. Schmalensee said he planned to vote for Mrs. Clinton, as did Matthew Slaughter, dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and a council member under Mr. Bush.Harvard's Gregory Mankiw, who chaired the council under President George W. Bush, said recently on his blog that he wouldn't support Mr. Trump.""I have Republican friends who think that things couldn't be worse than doubling down on Obama policies under Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Mankiw wrote. ""But they are wrong: Things could be worse. And I fear they would be under Mr. Trump.""Mrs. Clinton is ""incomparably better than Trump,"" said Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz, who chaired the council under President Bill Clinton.Credit: By Ben Leubsdorf, Josh Zumbrun and Eric Morath",11/17/16
Trump Immigration Fallout,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814098164?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump's mixed signals about easing his plan to deport all illegal immigrants are dividing his closest allies and prompting warnings he could lose core supporters if he abandons the signature issue of his campaign.Even as some supporters said they would welcome a softer tone as a sign Mr. Trump is working to broaden his support, he said in a Thursday CNN interview both that it would be difficult to deport 11 million illegal immigrants and that he might do it anyway.But in interviews this week with Fox News he backed away from his long-held proposal to deport the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants, suggesting those without criminal records could stay if they pay ""back taxes.""That didn't sit well with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was among the first high-profile Republicans to endorse Mr. Trump in January. ""If Mr. Trump were to go down a path of wishy-washy positions taken on things that the core foundation of his support has so appreciated, and that is respecting our Constitution and respecting law and order in America, then, yeah, there would be massive disappointment,"" the party's 2008 vice-presidential nominee said.In the CNN interview Thursday, Mr. Trump offered contradictory explanations for his deportation policy.""You can't take 11 [million] at one time and say, 'Boom your gone,'"" Mr. Trump said.Asked minutes later if he would deport illegal immigrants who haven't committed crimes, Mr. Trump replied: ""There is a very good chance the answer could be yes.""The internal Republican angst emerged on the same day that Mr. Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton exchanged pointed barbs in back-to-back speeches, suggesting a bitter fight through November. Mr. Trump this week has called Mrs. Clinton a ""bigot."" She responded Thursday by painting her GOP rival as a friend to racists.During a Thursday rally in Manchester, N.H., Mr. Trump renewed his pledge to build a wall along the Mexico border. But he stayed silent on what his plans now are for those already in the country.Mr. Trump's potential shift coincides with a shakeup of his campaign leadership and amid new appeals in the past week to black and Hispanic voters. The New York businessman, who met with minority leaders Thursday, is seeking to draw some of their support without losing the mostly white voters who propelled him to the GOP nomination.Rep. Tom Marino (R., Pa.), one of Mr. Trump's earliest congressional supporters, said the candidate is ""realizing the magnitude"" of immigration issues and altering his position.""It's going to be said he's changed his mind. Yes, he's changed his mind on some issues but not on all issues,"" Mr. Marino said. ""It takes a strong person to say, 'I am changing my position on this issue' to this extent and I give him credit for redefining it.""Deporting illegal immigrants was the centerpiece of the platform that drove Mr. Trump's success in the GOP primaries. In November he called for a ""deportation force"" to remove all 11 million undocumented immigrants. At one point he said American-born children of illegal immigrants would be removed from the country with their parents.During a February debate, Mr. Trump said anyone in the country illegally must leave and apply to be allowed to return.Although his aides say his policy hasn't changed, Mr. Trump's recent comments were raised by donors during aThursdayconference call with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is seeking contributions for the Republican transition committee.Gary Kirke, a casino executive who is Iowa finance chairman for the Trump-Republican National Committee State Victory program, told Mr. Christie reports of Mr. Trump's shifting positions are ""very scary."" Mr. Christie responded: ""I don't see him changing his positions at all on this,"" according to two people on the call.In a subsequent interview, Mr. Kirke said Mr. Trump would pay a high price if he backtracks on deportations. ""This immigration issue is so huge, that's what got him where he is today and he needs to straighten it out,"" he said.Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration controls, blamed Mr. Trump's new advisers for his changed rhetoric -- a move he said was intended to help Mr. Trump appeal to Hispanic audiences.""Whatever remaining chance he had to win the White House is gone,"" Mr. Krikorian said. ""The fact now that he has betrayed his base on the signature issue that he ran on seems to me the death knell of his candidacy.""Mr. Trump's hard-line immigration proposals pushed his GOP primary rivals to the right. Sen. Ted Cruz said illegal immigrants would be forced out of the country and not be allowed to return. Sen. Marco Rubio abandoned his prior support for comprehensive immigration reform.The issue of immigration is just the latest policy issue that the New York businessman has shifted on since facing a general election electorate.He has stopped speaking about barring Muslims from entering the country, despite the fact that hisDec. 7 pledge calling for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"" remains on his campaign website.Mr. Trump's new aides have had some trouble navigating their candidate's positions.When Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump's new campaign manager, was asked Wednesday on MSNBC if his proposal to bar immigrants from countries with terrorist enclaves would supplant the Muslim ban, she said: ""I don't think it supplants it at all. . . . I think it clarifies it.""Rep. Glenn Grothman (R., Wis.), a Trump supporter who introduced the candidate at a rally last week, said Republican voters never believed Mr. Trump's long-held assertions that he would deport 11 million illegal immigrants. ""You have to use some common sense,"" he said Thursday.---Laura Meckler and Janet Hook contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein and Beth Reinhard",11/17/16
Trump Faces Immigration Reality,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1814058009?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump isn't known for fixed ideological positions, which at least leaves room for intellectual progress. The Republican now seems open to what he calls ""softening"" his immigration agenda, and perhaps he's coming to recognize the economic and political realities that too many on the right have forgotten.On Wednesday night the candidate started to walk back his previous support for mass deportation of illegal immigrants in a town hall with Fox News's Sean Hannity. Mr. Trump, who once promised a ""deportation force,"" suggested that it would be ""a very, very hard thing"" to expel 11 million people. ""Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out,"" he continued, but maybe ""terrific"" undocumented workers could stay based on ""the merit system.""Mr. Hannity then asked, ""Here's the big question though. No citizenship?"" Mr. Trump said no, though he endorsed some sort of legal status short of citizenship: ""Let me go a step further -- they'll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes. There's no amnesty, as such. There's no amnesty, but we work with them.""Then in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday, Mr. Trump said ""there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back."" It's fair to say his views are inconsistent and evolving -- but they could be converging on more border security and enforcement, plus a form of earned legalization after a probationary period. As it happens, that's roughly the policy that Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and other Republicans endorsed in the primaries, which their critics on the right, Mr. Trump included, assailed as ""amnesty.""At a Fox Business-Wall Street Journal debate in November 2015, Mr. Trump said ""we have no choice"" other than deportation because ""we either have a country or we don't have a country."" He spoke favorably of Dwight Eisenhower's ""Operation Wetback"" removal program.Mr. Bush replied that deportation is ""just not possible . . . . It would tear communities apart. And it would send a signal that we're not the kind of country that I know America is. And even having this conversation sends a powerful signal -- they're doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this.""John Kasich added in the same debate that, ""For the 11 million people, come on, folks. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them back across the border. It's a silly argument. It is not an adult argument.""Perhaps the adults who recently joined Mr. Trump's campaign are educating him about the U.S. labor market's dependence on immigrants. Who knows, Mr. Trump might next explain to voters that the best way to solve the illegal immigration problem is to expand the ways for foreigners to come to the U.S. legally through guest-worker programs -- much like the seasonal H-2B visas he uses at Mar-a-Lago.More likely, Mr. Trump's pollsters have informed him that his core demographic coalition is too narrow to win a general election. He needs to expand his appeal among college-educated whites, moderate suburbanites and minorities, and these groups tend to be turned off by the idea of tens of thousands of federal agents breaking up families and raiding businesses in search of people without papers.Mr. Trump outflanked his GOP rivals on immigration with his willingness to say anything, and he proved that a restrictionist candidate could win the nomination. But his extreme position isn't winning among the general public. A new Pew survey asked if voters prioritized better border security or a path to citizenship, or whether both approaches should be given equal priority. Some 45% said equal priority -- in other words, the Bush-Rubio line and now maybe the Trump line. Legalization received 29% and border security 24%.Forty-five percent of Republicans said equal priority, 12% legalization, and 41% border security first. Hostility to immigration isn't all that popular even inside the GOP.All of this must be disconcerting to the conservatives who want to make deportation a GOP litmus test. They define ""amnesty"" as any reform that lets any undocumented worker stay in the U.S., and now even their adopted political hero may be abandoning them. At some point he may even endorse something that looks a lot like, well, amnesty.The political questions, as ever with Mr. Trump, are whether his new tone will last and whether too much electoral damage has already been done. Other than trade and American greatness hats, no issue is more closely associated with the candidate than immigration. Then again, Hillary Clinton gave a speech Thursday warning that there should be ""no illusions"" that Mr. Trump can reinvent himself. Maybe Democrats are worried he could win if he does.(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: E-Verify Is a Key to Ridding U.S. of Illegal Immigrants"" -- WSJ Aug. 30, 2016)",11/17/16
Trump Faces Narrow Path --- GOP nominee likely must sweep four key states where he now trails Hillary Clinton,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813587498?accountid=12768,"As the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the fall presidential race approaches, Republican Donald Trump faces an increasingly narrow path to the White House.A Trump victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton likely would require a sweep of a set of battleground states where he is competitive but trailing in recent opinion polls -- Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- and both campaigns describe them as the heart of the race. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, could win with just one of them, partly because Democrats start with a larger number of states that historically side with them.Both campaigns have put their money and their time in those states, despite suggestions they might turn elsewhere. Mr. Trump has traveled to those states more than others and has paid advertising in only these four states. Of the 20 media markets that have received the greatest number of ad spots placed by either the Clinton campaign or its main super PAC, 16 are in one of them, according to an ad tracker not affiliated with either campaign.""It just becomes very hard and difficult to understand how the Trump campaign gets to 270"" Electoral College votes needed to win, said Russ Schriefer, a strategist for Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign. Compared with that election, ""the map has shifted and is much more favorable to the Democrats.""Mr. Trump still has about 11 weeks to Election Day, and races tend to tighten toward the end. There is also enough time for unexpected revelations to alter the campaign's trajectory. But polls show Mrs. Clinton has momentum.Both her campaign and Priorities USA, a super PAC backing her, have pulled ads from Colorado and Virginia. They were battlegrounds in the last two campaigns, having voted Republican as recently as 2004 and in most elections in the decades prior.But demographic changes favor the Democrats, and polling shows Mrs. Clinton with solid leads in both states.If Mrs. Clinton carries those states and wins Pennsylvania, she could withstand losses in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and many other swing states -- assuming she holds the traditionally Democratic states. She also likely would win with a victory in Ohio or Florida, even without Pennsylvania, a sign of her strong position. But that state, with its long history favoring Democrats, may offer her the easiest path forward.""Pennsylvania is key to the entire race"" as a must-win state for Mr. Trump, said Mitch Stewart, who was battleground states director for Mr. Obama's 2012 re-election. For Mrs. Clinton, Pennsylvania likely would be the ""tipping point"""" -- the state that puts a candidate over 270 electoral votes when states are listed in order of the winner's most-likely victories, he said.Florida and Ohio, big states with large shares of electoral votes, long have been presidential battlegrounds, but demographic changes have made North Carolina, long a Republican stronghold, more favorable to Democrats. Then-Sen. Barack Obama won the state in 2008, though not in 2012.While Mr. Trump's first round of television advertising is restricted to four states, the Clinton campaign is airing ads in those states as well as in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada, three other swing states. It also is on the air in Omaha, hoping to pick off one electoral vote available in Nebraska, which allocates its share in part by congressional district.Those decisions show the campaigns' true priorities, amid predictions from Mr. Trump that he would win a string of Democratic-leaning states such as Minnesota, which hasn't backed a Republican for president since 1972.For her part, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has funneled money for field organizers to Georgia and Arizona, where polling, unlike in Minnesota, shows tight races. On Tuesday, the Clinton campaign opened a campaign office in Utah, which last voted Democratic in 1964.Democrats say they don't expect to necessarily win GOP-leaning states beyond the core battlegrounds. But they hope the moves will entice the Trump campaign to shift money from top-priority contests.Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment. A Republican strategist close to the Trump campaign suggested the GOP nominee might want to spend some of his time and money in these traditionally Republican states. He cited the volatile immigration issue as having an unpredictable impact on Arizona and said it might be necessary to work on voter mobilization in Georgia.Retaining Arizona, Georgia and Utah is essential for Mr. Trump, but for Mrs. Clinton, victory there likely would be Electoral College gravy. So, the Clinton campaign is focused on winning the states most likely to put her over the top, starting with Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, said Marlon Marshall, Mrs. Clinton's director of state campaigns and political engagement.Heading into the 2016 election, Democrats enjoyed a built-in advantage in the Electoral College. In every election since 1992, Democrats have won a set of 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, that add up to 242 Electoral College votes. Republicans have consistently held 13 states with 102 electoral votes.Mr. Schriefer, the GOP strategist, said that given current polling, the challenge for Mr. Trump is to increase his popularity with broad swaths of the electorate, not to turn things around in any particular state.The strategist close to the Trump campaign said the GOP nominee has some options, predicting his message would resonate where there is economic anxiety, such as Michigan and Wisconsin. Victories there would give Mr. Trump more options for assembling states for an Electoral College majority. The Clinton campaign has sent field organizers to both states but so far hasn't spent money on TV ads for either place.Credit: By Laura Meckler",11/17/16
Trump Wins Even If He Loses,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813544106?accountid=12768,"If you've paid close attention to the spectacle of the past 14 months, you understand that the Donald Trump crack that raised the most eyebrows -- his seeming invitation to gun enthusiasts to assassinate Hillary Clinton -- was actually a laugh at the expense of his own fans -- those ""Second Amendment people.""Donald's devotion to the Second Amendment, remind yourself, is of the same vintage as his devotion to ""Two Corinthians."" All he knows about the Second Amendment is that it elicits reliable cheers from the strange, non-New York folk in trucker hats who show up at his rallies. His inner Rupert Pupkin is showing through. The groans and guffaws are the kind that let a late-night emcee know he's hit it out of the park.Keep all this in mind as you ponder the latest Trump campaign news -- the departure of Paul Manafort, the arrival of Breitbart propaganda chief Stephen Bannon, the murmured suspicion that Trump and company are more interested in becoming the kings of angry white man media than winning the White House.Yes, maybe. Mr. Bannon is a former Goldman Sachs banker and would-be Hollywood film producer. Mr. Trump is a thrice-married New York playboy. These are gold-plated opportunists who see a golden opportunity for what it is -- a giant gift of free capital, tens of billions of dollars in free media exposure that can pay off under many different scenarios.The presidency is one. And it's a plum worth having -- as evidenced by the overdue adjustment of Trump rhetoric in a more reassuring, Reaganite direction.The presidency is often portrayed as a barrel of woe, but Mr. Trump is actually set up quite nicely if he wins. The minute he takes office, various Obama regulatory crusades against business come to an end. The chances of tax reform instantly go up, fixing a folly that keeps $2 trillion in U.S. offshore earnings from being reinvested in America. The stalemate over ObamaCare is instantly reset, so the economy can hope for an early correction to a looming train wreck.All this means that an incoming Trump administration, without having to do anything, would likely get a boost from the markets, employment numbers and gross domestic product.Then again, if the plum continues to recede from grasp, Mr. Trump can revert to form, claim the race is rigged, and cash in on a renewed gusher of valuable free media attention, which he and Mr. Bannon would attempt to fashion into a lasting franchise of wealth and influence for themselves way beyond the election.And the Republican Party is along for the ride. The GOP, it should painfully realize, is still in hock to Mr. Trump, not he to them. The party needs his voters to turn out and vote a straight GOP ticket to hold the House and Senate.Now we come to the interesting matter. Can the Trump spectacle pay off for the Republic? Or is this campaign the terrible, unredeeming news for the American people that the media keep telling us?Where this column has agreed with Ralph Nader over the years is in believing the differences between the parties can be exaggerated. The great centralizing tendency of American politics prevails when the country is on the right track -- as when a Carter-Reagan duo repaired the sick economy of the 1970s.It prevails when the country is on the wrong track, as when George W. Bush saddled his recovery with a new financial regulation (Sarbanes-Oxley) and big new health-care entitlement (Medicare Part D), and then the Obama administration did the same (Dodd-Frank and ObamaCare).Mr. Trump has both parties thinking about how they might have to realign their policy agenda to take account of a realigning electorate. His success has them finally registering how dissatisfying the Obama stagnation has been for tens of millions of voters, if not the coastal elites who make up their donor base and the sounding board for party leaders.Even Mrs. Clinton must realize that having a successful presidency would somehow mean striking a new path rather than creating a ""third Obama term"" (an idea foisted on her by Obamaites committed to the increasingly hopeless task of rewriting the Obama years as a triumph).Mrs. Clinton, unfortunately, is the opposite of a creative political force. She is no Bill Clinton; Dick Morris is nowhere in sight. If anything can open her mind, it would have to be the prospect of having to govern in partnership with a GOP majority in both houses.Meanwhile, those earnest Republicans still hoping Mr. Trump will stand aside for Mike Pence might as well ask Willie Sutton to give back the money for the sake of the bank. We who thought he might be chastened by potential damage to his brand have also wised up. On Nov. 9, the video offers and business proposals will pour in. Prepare to be amazed at how readily the aspirational aspects of the traditional Trump brand mix with his new outre political populist brand.And yet Republicans should lift their chins up. An element of chaos was always going to be necessary. Before us is the best chance for American reform in decades.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Rude Trump Is Still the Best Hope for Change"" -- WSJ August 30, 2016)Credit: By Holman W.

Election 2016: Trump Courts Black Voters -- From a Distance,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813530015?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump for the past week has been asking for support from African-American voters who have long backed Democrats, but his campaign has for months rebuffed invitations from supporters to appear before black audiences.The result is the Republican presidential candidate hasn't campaigned in the African-American communities he now says he wishes to win over. Supporters of the New York businessman say they have asked him to speak at black colleges, in black churches and to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- the nation's largest black advocacy organization -- but he has declined.""It can come across as disingenuous,"" said Derek McCoy, a black Maryland conservative who organizes clergy for the Center for Urban Renewal and Education, a Christian anti-poverty group. ""It's good to let your donors and your supporters know that you're trying to reach out. At the same time, the way that you reach out to African-Americans is go to some communities in Chicago or Detroit. Perhaps you need to visit Flint or some communities that are hard hit.""Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't respond to requests for comment.Mr. Trump began his recent appeal to black voters last Tuesday in Washington County, Wis., where 96% of the population is white. The campaign speech took place at a fairgrounds 25 miles from a largely African-American Milwaukee neighborhood that was at the time engulfed in turmoil after a black man was fatally shot by a police officer.Mr. Trump continued his appeal to black voters on Friday at a rally outside of Lansing, Mich. In a county that is 88% white, Mr. Trump said African-Americans have ""nothing to lose"" by supporting him, because their plight in America's Democratic-run inner cities is so dismal.OnMondaynight, he said the nation's inner cities are like ""war zones."" ""What do you have to lose?"" Mr. Trump asked in Akron, Ohio. ""Look, it is a disaster the way African-Americans are living. . . . We'll get rid of the crime. You'll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Right now, you walk down the street, you get shot.""Mr. Trump's new appeal has mystified some black Republicans who have tried for months to facilitate a conversation between the candidate and African-American voters.Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said he passed along requests from black colleges for Mr. Trump to speak. The requests were conveyed to the campaign, which didn't respond, said Mr. Steele, who is black.""The fact of the matter is it's something that you've got to be a little bit smarter about,"" said Mr. Steele, who said he would vote for Mr. Trump. ""You don't go to a white community to talk about black folks. Hello, it doesn't make sense.""The Trump campaign in July appointed as director of African-American outreach Omarosa Manigault, who was a contestant on the first season of Mr. Trump's show ""The Apprentice."" Ms. Manigault said she would answer questions about her work for the Trump campaign over email but then didn't respond to questions.Running against Barack Obama in the last two presidential elections, Republicans have struggled to attract African-American voters.Even without Mr. Obama on the ballot, polling suggests Mr. Trump could draw historically low numbers of black votes. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only one black person surveyed backed Mr. Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.---Janet Hook contributed to this article.Credit: By Reid J.

Politics & Ideas: Why Trump Is Failing With College Grads,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813529293?accountid=12768,"The support of white voters with a college education is the key battle of the 2016 presidential contest, and Donald Trump is losing it. In 2012 Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama by 14 points among college-educated whites, according to exit polls. The average of top national surveys shows Mr. Trump trailing Hillary Clinton among these voters by nine points, and the latest Pew Research Center survey gives Mrs. Clinton a 14-point edge.Unfortunately for Mr. Trump, these voters are more important than ever. As recently as 1988, whites without a college degree formed 54% of the electorate, compared with only 31% for whites with a four-year degree or more and 15% for nonwhite voters. A Center for American Progress analysis shows that by 2012, the noncollege white share of the electorate had fallen by 18 points to 36%, while college-educated white voters had risen five points to 36% and minority voters nearly doubled to 28%.Given underlying demographic trends, absent a massive mobilization of whites without college degrees, college-educated whites may constitute an outright majority of white voters in 2016 for the first time. Even with such a mobilization, Brookings demographer William Frey has shown, Mr. Trump would lose to Mrs. Clinton by roughly the same number of voters that separated Mr. Romney from President Obama.Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump seems determined to carry against the odds, illustrates this dynamic. In 2012, according to a recent Wall Street Journal analysis, Mr. Romney did almost equally well among whites with and without college degrees, winning these groups by 16 and 14 points, respectively. Although Mr. Trump is doing a bit better than Mr. Romney did among noncollege whites, he is losing white college graduates to Mrs. Clinton by a stunning 21 points, 53% to 32%. In tandem with almost invisible support of 1% among African-Americans (six points worse than Mr. Romney's meager showing), the Republican nominee's collapse among educated whites has given Mrs. Clinton a lead of twice President Obama's margin in the Keystone State.The most successful presidential candidates have always practiced the politics of addition, adding new groups to a party's existing base. Mr. Trump's politics of division is doing more to drive away traditional Republicans than to attract new supporters. Unless he can turn this around, he cannot prevail.It won't be easy, because education has emerged as a core dividing line in the electorate. All else equal, areas with large shares of highly educated voters are more likely to deliver Democratic majorities, and vice versa. A recent NPR analysis of Census Bureau statistics found that the 10 states with the highest share of college-educated voters are all Democratic while the 10 with the lowest share are Republican.Education casts a revealing light on the dynamics of the 2016 election. Mr. Trump tends to do better in states with low shares of both college-educated whites and minorities. Ohio and Iowa meet both tests; despite below-average shares of college-educated voters, Pennsylvania, Florida and Nevada do not. Conversely, Georgia, Arizona and Utah have above-average shares of college-educated voters, which helps explain why Mrs. Clinton is surprisingly competitive in these traditionally red states. If Mr. Trump were even modestly appealing to college-educated Republicans, she wouldn't have a chance in these states.Underlying these aggregates are deep differences of outlook and experience. College-educated voters are far more likely to believe that life for people like them is better than it was 50 years ago and that increased diversity has made the country better. Unlike less-educated voters, they believe that trade has benefited their family's finances. So Mr. Trump's signature issues -- passionate opposition to trade agreements and current immigration policies -- are bound to repel upscale Republicans even as they mobilize working-class voters.The problem goes even deeper. Mr. Trump's dark message of decline and fear resonates with less-educated white voters who have experienced downward mobility and cultural marginalization, but it does not speak to more educated center-right voters who have done well in recent decades. These voters respond negatively to utterances that smack of nativism, racism and religious prejudice, themes with which Mr. Trump has flirted.Gender poses a distinctive challenge for the Republican nominee. His Rat Pack sensibility plays especially poorly among college-educated white women. And the more they see it, the less they like it. Before the two party conventions, Mr. Frey's analysis shows, Mrs. Clinton's margin among these women was 45% to 42%. But after the conventions, her edge widened dramatically to 57% to 38%. By contrast, the conventions had no measurable impact on either candidate's support among white women without college degrees.As Dale Carnegie famously remarked, you never get a second chance to make a first impression. Mr. Trump's latest campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who reportedly channels the sentiments of educated Republican women, has her work cut out for her.Credit: By William A. Galston",11/17/16
Trump Turned Down the NAACP's Invitation; Smart Move,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813528039?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump is taking lumps for his clumsy and crude ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" black outreach effort. Black voters, until recently, seem to have been an afterthought for the Republican presidential nominee, who is much more focused on turning out the millions of white voters who supported John McCain in 2008 but stayed home when Mitt Romney ran four years later.If Mr. Trump is serious about increasing his minority support, we'll see him participating in more town halls with large black audiences and campaigning in those blighted neighborhoods that he says he wants to improve. If he really wants his message to reach the black electorate, Trump political ads will air on black websites and be featured during black radio and television programs. Until that happens, expect many blacks, including black Republicans and conservatives, to remain skeptical.Give Mr. Trump credit, however, for not doing something that too many Republican presidential candidates before him have done, only to have it blow up in their face. When the NAACP asked Mr. Trump to address its annual convention last month, he declined. Good for him. Giving speeches to civil-rights groups like the NAACP isn't effective black outreach. It's a setup. Blacks open to Republicanism aren't likely to be found at NAACP gatherings, which are thinly disguised Democratic political rallies. And younger blacks who might be interested in hearing out the GOP have little use for the NAACP. Republicans who try to reach black voters by going through the civil-rights establishment have nothing to gain, unless they like to watch footage of black people booing them on CNN.There was a time when the NAACP was a responsible gatekeeper of black communities, attuned to their needs and looking out for their best interests. Its leadership was comprised of serious people addressing serious concerns. But those days are a distant memory. Today's civil-rights leaders and organizations have their own agenda, and their highest priority by far is to stay relevant by insisting that white racism explains racial disparities -- even if that means turning the actual problems of poor black communities into a secondary concern.There have been many examples over the decades of the growing disconnect between the traditional black leadership's priorities and those of the black underclass, but the latest one is worth examining. Last month the NAACP called for a moratorium on charter schools, even though you would be hard-pressed to find an education model that has done more to narrow the black-white achievement gap over the past quarter century.Charter schools are among the best public schools in the country. It isn't uncommon for a charter located in an inner-city ghetto to outperform affluent white suburban schools on standardized tests. Last year in New York City, the nation's most populous public-school system, the charter schools outperformed all other schools in the state by an average of 18 points in reading, and charters were half of the city's top 10 schools in math proficiency. It's no surprise that the wait list for charter schools in many cities is thousands of children long -- more than 42,000 students are wait-listed in New York City -- and that blacks have the most to lose from the moratorium advocated by the NAACP.The NAACP claims to be acting in the interests of blacks, but its position on school choice couldn't be more at odds with the expressed views of black America. According to the latest Education Next national survey figures from Harvard's Paul Peterson, black support for alternatives to traditional public schools is as robust as it's ever been. Black respondents backed charter schools by two-to-one. Black support for means-tested vouchers was a similarly strong 66%.Civil-rights organizations have also been vocal in support of the Obama administration's efforts to pressure schools into suspending fewer black students regardless of their behavior. Yet the Education Next poll found no groundswell of support for race-based school discipline policies. Less than a third (29%) of all respondents backed the federal effort, including less than half (48%) of all blacks.The NAACP's opposition to charter schools and support for coddling black school bullies has little to do with the merits. The bottom line is that teachers unions fiercely oppose school choice and are major contributors to the NAACP. Blaming racially disparate school suspension rates on white racism comports with the organization's preferred narrative and keeps the NAACP relevant.Should the Trump campaign do a better job of addressing the actual needs of black voters? Sure. But these days, you could fairly say the same thing about groups like the NAACP.---Mr. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Journal contributor, is the author of ""Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed"" (Encounter Books, 2014).Credit: By Jason L.

Election 2016: Trump Says He Isn't Waffling on Immigration,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813142775?accountid=12768,"Despite signs that Donald Trump may be softening his rhetoric on the issue that catapulted him to political prominence -- cracking down on illegal immigrants -- the Republican presidential nominee said Monday that he wasn't waffling and reiterated his commitment to strict anti-immigration measures.""I'm not flip-flopping,"" Mr. Trump said Monday in a Fox News interview, one day after his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said that Mr. Trump's stance on deporting the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants, long a central element of his policy platform, was ""to be determined.""At a rally in Akron, Ohio, on Monday night, Mr. Trump reiterated his pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to keep illegal immigrants out of the country.""We've going to build a wall folks, don't worry, we're going to build a wall,"" he said. ""That wall will go up so fast your head will spin.""But he did add a twist that played to recent campaign efforts to reach out to Hispanic and African-American voters: He argued that minority citizens are hardest hit by the influx of illegal workers.""Low-income workers are hurt the most by my opponent's policies,"" he said. ""Poor Hispanic and African-American citizens are the first to lose a job, or see a pay cut, when we don't control our borders.""Earlier Monday, in a Fox News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to strike a different note. ""We want to come up with a fair but firm process,"" he said. ""Fair but firm."" He didn't, however, provide any specifics or elaborate further on his position.Mr. Trump had planned to travel to Colorado later this week, and there had been widespread reports that he would give a speech there on immigration. Those plans never came together, but his supporters said they believe such an event will be scheduled at a future date. A Trump campaign official in Colorado didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The campaign had also planned a Friday rally in Nevada, a state with a large Hispanic population, where Mr. Trump hopes to be competitive. The event no longer appears on the campaign website.The harsh anti-immigration rhetoric that Mr. Trump used from the outset of his presidential campaign, when he accused Mexico of sending ""rapists"" and ""criminals"" to the U.S., was one of most prominent elements of his candidacy.Anti-illegal immigration policies remain on his campaign website and are central to the message of the first TV commercial he is airing in the general election campaign.""In Hillary Clinton's America, the system stays rigged against Americans,"" the ad says. ""Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay.""But his rhetoric has risked alienating more-centrist voters and Republicans who have argued the GOP has to do a better job of appealing to Hispanics, who make up a fast-growing part of the electorate.""He's finally figured out you can't win a presidential election . . . just with white votes,"" said Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster who worked with Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential campaign.Javier Palomarez, president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said nuanced changes in rhetoric now won't win more support for Mr. Trump among Hispanic voters who have been offended by months of harsh talk.""It is a bit too late; he cannot unring the bell,"" Mr. Palomarez said.Some Hispanics who have been courted by Mr. Trump welcomed his new language.""I think I am starting to see more nuance in his immigration policy, which is a good thing,"" said state Rep. Jose Felix Diaz of Miami, who was named to Mr. Trump's newly formed National Hispanic Advisory Council.---Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Credit: By Janet Hook and Beth Reinhard",11/17/16
Election 2016: Voter Influx Appears Missing for Trump --- Registrations in battlegrounds show modest rise; whites make up larger share,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813142523?accountid=12768,"This year's presidential primaries produced a slight increase in new voters compared with 2012, but not in numbers that suggest a major influx that might benefit Republican candidate Donald Trump, a new analysis of voter registration data finds.The study by the Democratic firm Catalist, which analyzed records from 10 battleground states this year through June, suggest that the record-breaking turnout seen in the Republican primaries was the result of general election voters becoming motivated to show up for the party's turbulent primary season, rather than a big inflow of new supporters into the Republican Party.But in potential good news for the Trump campaign, Catalist found that white voters accounted for a larger share of the new-voter pool in the first half of this year compared with 2012, and that the number and share of African-Americans was down. Mr. Trump has been trying to capitalize on his strong support among working-class whites, while his hold on African-American voters is weak, polling shows.Mr. Trump has said that his candidacy during the primary season was drawing large numbers of new voters to the GOP, who would carry him to victory in November. The Catalist findings, from a large analysis of registrations, suggest that the pool of new voters in 10 of the most competitive states is so far relatively stable compared with previous election cycles, barring any major new spikes in fall voter registration.Similarly, a Republican firm, Optimus, concluded in a two-state analysis that the GOP primaries were activating general-election voters to participate in primaries rather than adding large numbers of new voters to the rolls. In Ohio, for example, the firm found that 46.4% of primary voters this year had never before voted before in a party primary, but only about 6% had never voted before in any election, its study found.""It appears Trump has created new Republican voters, but what remains to be seen is if the modest increase is enough to overcome losses among the longtime Republican voting electorate,"" said Scott Tranter, a co-founder of Optimus.In its study, Catalist found that about 1.4 million people joined the voter rolls in 10 battleground states this year through June, compared with about 1.3 million in 2012.New registrations compared with 2008 were lower in nine of the 10 states studied. Ohio was the only exception.""The data covers the period of the Republican primaries, when Donald Trump was proclaiming that he was going to change the electorate and bring lots of new people in,"" said Mike Podhorzer, co-chairman of Catalist's board of managers, who also is the AFL-CIO political director.He said the data show that ""the Trump effect in the primaries was to energize a lot of people who were Republican voters in the first place"" and who voted in general elections but had tended to skip primaries.The share of white voters in the new-voter pool rose by nearly 16% in the first half of this year compared with 2012, Catalist found. The share of African-Americans fell by 12% and also was down from 2008.Ohio, a state that is crucial to Mr. Trump's efforts, is one state that has seen an influx of white voters. About 20,000 more new white voters registered this year than in 2012.Mr. Trump is hoping to maximize his turnout among white voters without a college degree in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, among other states.Historical patterns show that voter registration rises in the weeks leading up to Election Day, and so it remains possible that Mr. Trump could energize new voters before the general election. About 90 million Americans who are eligible voters don't cast ballots at all, in either primary or general election campaigns.Catalist's analysis covers voter registrations in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and runs between January through the end of June.The analysis used data on race from states that collect that information; for others, the firm creates models to assess the race of voters based on data taken from other sources.Donald Trump's approximately 13.3 million votes represents the high-water mark of Republican primary votes in any modern campaign.

Election 2016: Trump Shifts on Deportation Stance,http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813880874?accountid=12768,"JACKSON, Miss. -- Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposed contradictory immigration policies Wednesday, saying in a broadcast interview that it would be ""a very, very hard thing"" to deport illegal immigrants who have been in the country for decades.During the primaries, he called for a ""deportation force"" to remove all 11 million undocumented immigrants, and a campaign aide said Wednesday his position hasn't changed. He also said this to Fox News host Sean Hannity on Tuesday about people who have overstayed their visas: ""We have to get them out.""In a continuation of the interview broadcast Wednesday, he told Mr. Hannity that he opposed citizenship for those in the country illegally, but added: ""Let me go a step further -- they'll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them.""Mr. Trump said he has been persuaded to take this new position by people who have told him it is ""tough"" to remove law-abiding undocumented immigrants.""Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out,"" he said. ""But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject, and I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me, and they've said, 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,' I have it all the time!""Aides to his defeated GOP primary opponents pointed out on social media that his comments amount to the ""amnesty"" that Mr. Trump and others have long accused moderate Republicans of supporting. On Wednesday, Tim Miller, the former spokesman for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said Mr. Trump's statements amount to ""basically Jeb's position.""Before Mr. Trump's Fox interview aired, he spoke at a rally where he condemned other politicians and the media who, he said, pay no attention to illegal immigration. ""Why do our leaders spend so much more time talking about how to help people here illegally, than they spend trying to help American citizens?""He also attacked his Democratic rival, saying ""Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future."" Mrs. Clinton responded in a CNN interview: ""He is taking a hate movement mainstream.""Separately, Nigel Farage, leader of the populist movement that resulted in Britain voting to withdraw from the European Union in June, encouraged Trump supporters to follow Britain's lead in challenging the status quo. ""If I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me,"" he told the crowd in Jackson.Credit: By Reid J. Epstein and Janet Hook",11/18/16
"Old Trump, New Tricks",http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1813861517?accountid=12768,"Donald Trump has used a tactic familiar to football fans: misdirection. You pretend you're headed one way, then go in another. ""I am who I am,"" the GOP nominee insisted last week. ""It's me. I don't want to change."" This suggested that Mr. Trump would double down on insults, ad libs, exaggerations, vendettas and bouts of political incorrectness. The campaign's newly hired CEO, Steve Bannon of Breitbart News, was seen as exactly the person to unleash Mr. Trump's wild side.Yet the opposite happened. Mr. Trump leashed himself to the teleprompter. He apologized for causing pain to those he had attacked. He met with Hispanics and appealed to African-Americans. He began to soften his harshest positions, like deporting millions of illegal immigrants. He stopped bragging and trashing the press.Skeptics of Mr. Trump's ability to continue in this fashion abound. After all, he has never been disciplined for long. On Monday, he slipped and tweeted several put-downs. These kinds of unforced errors have left Mr. Trump in a deep hole and made him a long shot for the White House.Assuming that he is committed to being serious and amicable, Mr. Trump has a chance to overtake Hillary Clinton and win. But he must tame his ego. His instinct is to dominate the media coverage -- with tweets, interviews, speeches -- and put himself front and center in the minds of voters every day. That worked in the Republican primaries. But now it means allowing Mrs. Clinton to recede into the background. Knowing this, Mrs. Clinton generally keeps a low profile.It might seem counterintuitive, but always being the center of attention doesn't help Mr. Trump. It only makes his style -- especially his temperament and gaffes -- a constant target, putting him invariably on the defensive. Since most of the media are hostile to him, the coverage is routinely unfavorable. The political result: Mrs. Clinton gains and Mr. Trump slumps.What he needs is role reversal, to make Mrs. Clinton into issue No. 1 and force her to play defense. The press assigned to the presidential campaign won't be much help. Their alibi is that they've already vetted Mrs. Clinton. They showed little interest in getting to the bottom of her claim that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had advised her to use a personal email system.It wasn't until People magazine encountered Mr. Powell at a Saturday-night event in East Hampton, N.Y., that his rejection of that story came to light. ""Her people have been trying to pin it on me,"" Mr. Powell said. ""The truth is she was using [her private server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.""Nor is the press eager to dig into the Clinton Foundation, though emails obtained by Judicial Watch documented unethical contacts between it and aides to Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state. By and large the media are inclined to treat the foundation as old news. Absent newly released emails, it's up to Mr. Trump to keep the foundation scandal alive.If Mr. Trump can subdue his ego and yield the spotlight to Mrs. Clinton and her agenda, he has an advantage. On most matters of substance, polls show voters prefer his positions to hers.He would repeal ObamaCare. She wouldn't. He would fill Supreme Court vacancies with conservatives. She would choose liberals. He would end President Obama's executive order on illegal immigrants. She would expand it. He would cut taxes. She would raise taxes. He would curtail regulation on energy production. She would increase regulation.To make her agenda into a major topic in the presidential race, Mr. Trump will have to talk about it ceaselessly and allow no antics to avert the media's attention.Finally, there's a cloud over Mr. Trump that will keep him from the presidency if he doesn't dissipate it effectively. It's the question of his temperament. The Clinton campaign has made this the paramount issue. Mrs. Clinton's best speech of the campaign so far argued that Mr. Trump is too unsteady to be president.Worse for Mr. Trump, 50 former national-security advisers and foreign-policy experts in Republican administrations made essentially the same point in a devastating statement in July. They said he lacks ""the character, values, and experience to be president"" and ""has shown no interest in educating himself."" All 50 said they wouldn't vote for him.Their statement put the onus squarely on Mr. Trump, though he hasn't got much time remaining to educate himself. He's a smart man and a quick study, but he has to want to learn far more about national security and foreign policy than one can pick up from watching television talk shows.Mr. Trump will never be an expert, but he could learn enough to keep from embarrassing himself this fall in any debate on foreign policy. Mrs. Clinton will have the advantage of knowledge and experience and she's underrated as a debater. Facing her one on one will be the biggest test of Mr. Trump's candidacy. If he backed out of the debate, it would be an admission of inadequacy. And it would leave no room for misdirection.---Mr. Barnes is executive editor of the Weekly Standard.(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Let Trump Be Trump, You Who Have Been So Mistaken"" -- WSJ Sept. 7, 2016)Credit: By Fred Barnes",11/18/16
